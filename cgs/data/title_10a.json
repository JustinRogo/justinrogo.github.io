Only audited financial statements shall be accepted from a nationally accredited school. Upon a nonaccredited school's written request, the commissioner may authorize, for good cause shown, a filing extension for a period not to exceed sixty days. No filing extensions shall be granted to a nationally accredited school.\n\n(h) The failure of any private career school to submit an application to the Office of Higher Education for the renewal of a certificate of authorization on or before the date on which it is due may result in the loss of authorization under section 10a-22f . The commissioner of said office may deny the renewal of such certificate of authorization if there exists a failure to file such renewal application by the date on which it is due, or the end of any period of extension authorized pursuant to subsection (e) of this section."

              "ARTICLE I",
              "The purposes of the New England Higher Education Compact shall be to provide greater educational opportunities and services through the establishment and maintenance of a coordinated educational program for the persons residing in the several states of New England parties to this compact, with the aim of furthering higher education in the fields of medicine, dentistry, veterinary medicine, public health and in professional, technical, scientific, literary and other fields.",

The board shall be a body corporate and politic, having the powers, duties and jurisdiction herein enumerated and such other and additional powers as shall be conferred upon it by the concurrent act or acts of the compacting states. The board shall consist of eight resident members from each compacting state, at least two of whom shall be members of the legislature, chosen in the manner and for the terms provided by law of the several states parties to this compact.",

It may appoint and employ an executive secretary and may employ such stenographic, clerical, technical or legal personnel as shall be necessary, and at its pleasure remove or discharge such personnel. It shall adopt a seal which may be necessary for the conduct of its business. It may maintain an office or offices within the territory of the compacting states and may meet at any time or place. Meetings shall be held at least once each year. A majority of the members shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business, but no action of the board imposing any obligation on any compacting state shall be binding unless a majority of the members from such compacting state shall have voted in favor thereof. Where meetings are planned to discuss matters relevant to problems of education affecting only certain of the compacting states, the board may vote to authorize special meetings of the board members of such states. The board shall keep accurate accounts of all receipts and disbursements and shall make an annual report to the governor and the legislature of each compacting state, setting forth in detail the operations and transactions conducted by it pursuant to this compact, and shall make recommendations for any legislative action deemed by it advisable, including amendments to the statutes of the compacting states which may be necessary to carry out the intent and purpose of this compact.

The board may meet any of its obligations in whole or in part with funds available to it under Article VII of this compact; provided, that the board takes specific action setting aside such funds prior to the incurring of any obligation to be met in whole or in part in this manner. Except where the board makes use of funds available to it under Article VII hereof, the board shall not incur any obligations for salaries, office, administrative, traveling or other expenses prior to the allotment of funds by the compacting states adequate to meet the same. Each compacting state reserves the right to provide hereafter by law for the examination and audit of the accounts of the board. The board shall appoint a treasurer and assistant treasurer who may be empowered to perform any and all duties of the treasurer. Fiscal disbursements of the board shall be valid only when authorized by any two persons from among those authorized by the board to execute this authority, and when substantiated by vouchers signed and countersigned by any two members from among those authorized by the board to execute this authority. The executive secretary shall be custodian of the records of the board with authority to attest to and certify such records or copies thereof.",

Each of the compacting states shall contribute funds to carry out the contracts of the board on the basis of the number of students from such state for whom the board may contract. Contributions shall be at the rate determined by the board in each education field. Except in those instances where the board by specific action allocates funds available to it under Article VII hereof, the board's authority to enter into such contracts shall be only upon appropriation of funds by the compacting states. Any contract entered into shall be in accordance with rules and regulations promulgated by the board and in accordance with the laws of the compacting states.",

The board shall administer property held in accordance with special trusts, grants and bequests, and shall also administer grants and devises of land and gifts or bequests of personal property made to the board for special uses, and shall execute said trusts, investing the proceeds thereof in notes or bonds secured by sufficient mortgages or other securities.",

Such action shall not be effective until two years after notice thereof has been sent by the governor of the state desiring to withdraw to the governors of all other states then parties to the compact. Such withdrawal shall not relieve the withdrawing state from its obligations accruing hereunder prior to the effective date of withdrawal. Any state so withdrawing, unless reinstated, shall cease to have any claim to or ownership of any of the property held by or vested in the board or to any of the funds of the board held under the terms of the compact. Thereafter, the withdrawing state may be reinstated by application after appropriate legislation is enacted by such state, upon approval by a majority vote of the board.",

Unless such default shall be remedied within a period of two years following the effective date of such default, this compact may be terminated with respect to such defaulting state by affirmative vote of three-fourths of the other member states. Any such defaulting state may be reinstated by (a) performing all acts and obligations upon which it has heretofore defaulted, and (b) application to and approval by a majority vote of the board."

Such portion shall be calculated by multiplying (i) the total amount of such federal educational assistance to be paid to a regional community-technical college on behalf of such veteran by (ii) an amount obtained by dividing (I) the actual tuition charged by such college to such veteran by (II) the sum of the actual tuition and fees charged by such college to such veteran.",

Such funds shall be used to provide tuition waivers, tuition remissions, grants for educational expenses and student employment for residents enrolled in regional community-technical colleges as full or part-time matriculated students in a degree-granting program, or enrolled in a precollege remedial program, who demonstrate substantial financial need. Said board may also set aside from its anticipated tuition revenue an additional amount equal to one per cent of said tuition revenue for financial assistance for students who would not otherwise be eligible for financial assistance but who do have a financial need as determined by the college in accordance with this subsection. In determining such financial need, the college shall exclude the value of equity in the principal residence of the student's parents or legal guardians, or in the student's principal residence if the student is not considered to be a dependent of his parents or legal guardians and shall assess the earnings of a dependent student at the rate of thirty per cent.",

            "text": "(a) Subject to the provisions of section 10a-26 , the Board of Trustees of the Community-Technical Colleges shall fix fees for tuition at the regional community-technical colleges and shall fix fees for such other purposes as the board deems necessary at the regional community-technical colleges, and may make refunds to the same.\n\n(b) The Board of Regents for Higher Education shall establish and administer a fund to be known as the Regional Community-Technical Colleges Operating Fund. Appropriations from general revenues of the state and, upon request by the board and with an annual review and approval by the Secretary of the Office of Policy and Management, the amount of the appropriations for fringe benefits and workers' compensation applicable to the regional community-technical colleges pursuant to subsection (a) of section 4-73 , shall be transferred from the Comptroller, and all tuition revenue received by the regional community-technical colleges in accordance with the provisions of subsection (a) of this section shall be deposited in said fund. Income from student fees or related charges; the proceeds of auxiliary activities and business enterprises, gifts and donations; federal funds and grants for purposes other than research, and all receipts derived from the conduct by the colleges of their education extension programs and summer school sessions shall be credited to said fund but shall be allocated to the central office and institutional operating accounts which shall be established and maintained for the central office and each community-technical college. If the Secretary of the Office of Policy and Management disapproves such transfer, the secretary may require the amount of the appropriation for operating expenses to be used for personal services and fringe benefits to be excluded from said fund. The State Treasurer shall review and approve the transfer prior to such request by the board. The board shall establish an equitable policy, in accordance with section 10a-8 , for allocation of appropriations from general revenues of the state, fringe benefits transferred from the Comptroller and tuition revenue deposited in the Regional Community-Technical Colleges Operating Fund. At the beginning of each quarter of the fiscal year, the board shall allocate and transfer, in accordance with said policy, moneys for expenditure in such institutional operating accounts, exclusive of amounts retained for central office operations and reasonable reserves for future distribution. All costs of waiving or remitting tuition pursuant to subsection (f) of this section shall be charged to the Regional Community-Technical Colleges Operating Fund. Repairs, alterations or additions to facilities supported by operating funds and costing one million dollars or more shall require the approval of the General Assembly, or when the General Assembly is not in session, of the Finance Advisory Committee. Any balance of receipts above expenditures shall remain in said fund, except such sums as may be required for deposit into a debt service fund or the General Fund for further payment by the Treasurer of debt service on general obligation bonds of the state issued for purposes of the regional community-technical colleges.\n\n(c) Commencing December 1, 1984, and thereafter not later than sixty days after the close of each quarter, the board of trustees shall submit to the joint standing committee of the General Assembly having cognizance of matters relating to appropriations and the budgets of state agencies, the Office of Higher Education and the Office of Policy and Management a report on the actual expenditures of the Regional Community-Technical Colleges Operating Fund.\n\n(d) Said board of trustees shall waive the payment of tuition at any of the regional community-technical colleges (1) for any dependent child of a person whom the armed forces of the United States has declared to be missing in action or to have been a prisoner of war while serving in such armed forces after January 1, 1960, which child has been accepted for admission to such institution and is a resident of the state at the time such child is accepted for admission to such institution, (2) subject to the provisions of subsection (e) of this section, for any veteran, as defined in section 27-103 , who performed service in time of war, as defined in section 27-103 , except that for purposes of this subsection, “service in time of war” shall not include time spent in attendance at a military service academy, which veteran has been accepted for admission to such institution and is domiciled in this state at the time such veteran is accepted for admission to such institution, (3) for any resident of the state sixty-two years of age or older, provided, at the end of the regular registration period, there are enrolled in the course a sufficient number of students other than those residents eligible for waivers pursuant to this subdivision to offer the course in which such resident intends to enroll and there is space available in such course after accommodating all such students, (4) for any student attending the Connecticut State Police Academy who is enrolled in a law enforcement program at said academy offered in coordination with a regional community-technical college which accredits courses taken in such program, (5) for any active member of the Connecticut Army or Air National Guard who (A) has been certified by the Adjutant General or such Adjutant General's designee as a member in good standing of the guard, and (B) is enrolled or accepted for admission to such institution on a full-time or part-time basis in an undergraduate degree-granting program, (6) for any dependent child of a (A) police officer, as defined in section 7-294a , or supernumerary or auxiliary police officer, (B) firefighter, as defined in section 7-323j , or member of a volunteer fire company, (C) municipal employee, or (D) state employee, as defined in section 5-154 , killed in the line of duty, (7) for any resident of the state who is a dependent child or surviving spouse of a specified terrorist victim who was a resident of this state, (8) for any dependent child of a resident of the state who was killed in a multivehicle crash at or near the intersection of Routes 44 and 10 and Nod Road in Avon on July 29, 2005, and (9) for any resident of the state who is a dependent child or surviving spouse of a person who was killed in action while performing active military duty with the armed forces of the United States on or after September 11, 2001, and who was a resident of this state. If any person who receives a tuition waiver in accordance with the provisions of this subsection also receives educational reimbursement from an employer, such waiver shall be reduced by the amount of such educational reimbursement. Veterans and members of the National Guard described in subdivision (5) of this subsection shall be given the same status as students not receiving tuition waivers in registering for courses at regional community-technical colleges. Notwithstanding the provisions of section 10a-30 , as used in this subsection, “domiciled in this state” includes domicile for less than one year.\n\n(e) (1) If any veteran described in subsection (d) of this section has applied for federal educational assistance under the Post-9/11 Veterans Educational Assistance Act of 2008, the board of trustees shall waive the payment of tuition at any of the regional community-technical colleges for such veteran in accordance with subdivision (2) of this subsection. If any such veteran certifies to said board that such veteran's application for such federal educational assistance has been denied or withdrawn, said board of trustees shall waive the payment of tuition in accordance with subsection (d) of this section.\n\n(2) (A) For purposes of this subdivision, “veteran tuition benefit” means the portion of federal educational assistance under the Post-9/11 Veterans Educational Assistance Act of 2008 to be paid to a regional community-technical college on behalf of a veteran that represents payment for tuition. Such portion shall be calculated by multiplying (i) the total amount of such federal educational assistance to be paid to a regional community-technical college on behalf of such veteran by (ii) an amount obtained by dividing (I) the actual tuition charged by such college to such veteran by (II) the sum of the actual tuition and fees charged by such college to such veteran.\n\n(B) Said board of trustees shall waive the payment of tuition in excess of the veteran tuition benefit at any of the regional community-technical colleges for such veteran.\n\n(f) Said board shall set aside from its anticipated regional community-technical college tuition revenue, an amount not less than that required by said board's tuition policy. Such funds shall be used to provide tuition waivers, tuition remissions, grants for educational expenses and student employment for residents enrolled in regional community-technical colleges as full or part-time matriculated students in a degree-granting program, or enrolled in a precollege remedial program, who demonstrate substantial financial need. Said board may also set aside from its anticipated tuition revenue an additional amount equal to one per cent of said tuition revenue for financial assistance for students who would not otherwise be eligible for financial assistance but who do have a financial need as determined by the college in accordance with this subsection. In determining such financial need, the college shall exclude the value of equity in the principal residence of the student's parents or legal guardians, or in the student's principal residence if the student is not considered to be a dependent of his parents or legal guardians and shall assess the earnings of a dependent student at the rate of thirty per cent.\n\n(g) The Regional Community-Technical Colleges Operating Fund shall be reimbursed for the amount by which the tuition waivers granted under subsection (d) of this section exceed five per cent of tuition revenue through an annual state appropriation. The board of trustees shall request such an appropriation and said appropriation shall be based upon an estimate of tuition revenue loss using tuition rates in effect for the fiscal year in which such appropriation will apply.\n\n(h) Said board of trustees shall allow any student who is a member of the armed forces called to active duty during any semester to enroll in any course for which such student had remitted tuition but which was not completed due to active duty status. Such course reenrollment shall be offered to any qualifying student for a period not exceeding four years after the date of release from active duty without additional tuition, student fee or related charge, except if such student has been fully reimbursed for the tuition, fees and charges for the course that was not completed.\n\n(i) The Board of Regents for Higher Education shall not assess or charge a graduation fee to any student enrolled in a regional community-technical college for the purpose of graduating from such regional community-technical college.\n\nSee Sec. 4-73a re determination of actual rate for fringe benefits for funds of the constituent units of the state system of higher education.\n\nSee Sec. 10a-104b for definition of “specified terrorist victim”."

Such portion shall be calculated by multiplying (i) the total amount of such federal educational assistance to be paid to the Connecticut State University System on behalf of such veteran by (ii) an amount obtained by dividing (I) the actual tuition charged by the Connecticut State University System to such veteran by (II) the sum of the actual tuition and fees charged by the Connecticut State University System to such veteran.",

Such funds shall be used to provide tuition waivers, tuition remissions, grants for educational expenses and student employment for any undergraduate or graduate student who is enrolled as a full or part-time matriculated student in a degree-granting program, or enrolled in a precollege remedial program, and who demonstrates substantial financial need. Said board may also set aside from its anticipated tuition revenue an additional amount equal to one per cent of said tuition revenue for financial assistance for students who would not otherwise be eligible for financial assistance but who do have a financial need as determined by the university in accordance with this subsection. In determining such financial need, the university shall exclude the value of equity in the principal residence of the student's parents or legal guardians, or in the student's principal residence if the student is not considered to be a dependent of his parents or legal guardians and shall assess the earnings of a dependent student at the rate of thirty per cent.",

Such course reenrollment shall be offered to any qualifying student for a period not exceeding four years after the date of release from active duty without additional tuition, student fee or related charge, except if such student has been fully reimbursed for the tuition, fees and charges for the course that was not completed.",

Appropriations from general revenues of the state and upon request by the Connecticut State University System and with the annual review and approval by the Secretary of the Office of Policy and Management, the amount of the appropriations for fringe benefits pursuant to subsection (a) of section 4-73 , shall be transferred from the State Comptroller and all tuition revenue received by the Connecticut State University System in accordance with the provisions of subsection (a) of this section shall be deposited in said fund. Income from student fees or related charges, the proceeds of auxiliary activities and business enterprises, gifts and donations, federal funds and grants, subject to the provisions of sections 10a-98 to 10a-98g , inclusive, and all receipts derived from the conduct by a state university of its education extension program and its summer school session shall be credited to said fund but shall be allocated to the central office and institutional operating accounts which shall be established and maintained for the central office and each state university. Any such gifts and donations, federal funds and grants for purposes of research shall be allocated to separate accounts within such central office and institutional operating accounts. If the Secretary of the Office of Policy and Management disapproves such transfer, the secretary may require the amount of the appropriation for operating expenses to be used for personal services and fringe benefits to be excluded from said fund. The State Treasurer shall review and approve the transfer prior to such request by the university. The board shall establish an equitable policy, in accordance with section 10a-8 , for allocation of appropriations from general revenues of the state, fringe benefits transferred from the State Comptroller and tuition revenue deposited in the Connecticut State University System Operating Fund. At the beginning of each quarter of the fiscal year, the board shall allocate and transfer, in accordance with said policy, moneys for expenditure in such institutional operating accounts, exclusive of amounts retained for central office operations and reasonable reserves for future distribution. All costs of waiving or remitting tuition pursuant to subsection (f) of this section shall be charged to the Connecticut State University System Operating Fund. Repairs, alterations or additions to facilities supported by the Connecticut State University System Operating Fund and costing one million dollars or more shall require the approval of the General Assembly, or when the General Assembly is not in session, of the Finance Advisory Committee. Any balance of receipts above expenditures shall remain in said fund, except such sums as may be required for deposit into a debt service fund or the General Fund for further payment by the Treasurer of debt service on general obligation bonds of the state issued for purposes of the Connecticut State University System.\n\n(c) Commencing December 1, 1984, and thereafter not later than sixty days after the close of each quarter, the board of trustees shall submit to the joint standing committee of the General Assembly having cognizance of matters relating to appropriations and the budgets of state agencies, the Office of Higher Education and the Office of Policy and Management a report on the actual expenditures of the Connecticut State University System Operating Fund.\n\n(d) Said board shall waive the payment of tuition fees for undergraduate and graduate degree programs at the Connecticut State University System (1) for any dependent child of a person whom the armed forces of the United States has declared to be missing in action or to have been a prisoner of war while serving in such armed forces after January 1, 1960, which child has been accepted for admission to such institution and is a resident of the state at the time such child is accepted for admission to such institution, (2) subject to the provisions of subsection (e) of this section, for any veteran, as defined in section 27-103 , who performed service in time of war, as defined in section 27-103 , except that for purposes of this subsection, “service in time of war” shall not include time spent in attendance at a military service academy, which veteran has been accepted for admission to such institution and is domiciled in this state at the time such veteran is accepted for admission to such institution, (3) for any resident of the state sixty-two years of age or older who has been accepted for admission to such institution, provided (A) such resident is enrolled in a degree-granting program, or (B) at the end of the regular registration period, there are enrolled in the course a sufficient number of students other than those residents eligible for waivers pursuant to this subdivision to offer the course in which such resident intends to enroll and there is space available in such course after accommodating all such students, (4) for any student attending the Connecticut Police Academy who is enrolled in a law enforcement program at said academy offered in coordination with the university which accredits courses taken in such program, (5) for any active member of the Connecticut Army or Air National Guard who (A) has been certified by the Adjutant General or such Adjutant General's designee as a member in good standing of the guard, and (B) is enrolled or accepted for admission to such institution on a full-time or part-time basis in an undergraduate or graduate degree-granting program, (6) for any dependent child of a (A) police officer, as defined in section 7-294a , or supernumerary or auxiliary police officer, (B) firefighter, as defined in section 7-323j , or member of a volunteer fire company, (C) municipal employee, or (D) state employee, as defined in section 5-154 , killed in the line of duty, (7) for any resident of this state who is a dependent child or surviving spouse of a specified terrorist victim who was a resident of the state, (8) for any dependent child of a resident of the state who was killed in a multivehicle crash at or near the intersection of Routes 44 and 10 and Nod Road in Avon on July 29, 2005, and (9) for any resident of the state who is a dependent child or surviving spouse of a person who was killed in action while performing active military duty with the armed forces of the United States on or after September 11, 2001, and who was a resident of this state. If any person who receives a tuition waiver in accordance with the provisions of this subsection also receives educational reimbursement from an employer, such waiver shall be reduced by the amount of such educational reimbursement. Veterans and members of the National Guard described in subdivision (5) of this subsection shall be given the same status as students not receiving tuition waivers in registering for courses at Connecticut state universities. Notwithstanding the provisions of section 10a-30 , as used in this subsection, “domiciled in this state” includes domicile for less than one year.\n\n(e) (1) If any veteran described in subsection (d) of this section has applied for federal educational assistance under the Post-9/11 Veterans Educational Assistance Act of 2008, the board of trustees shall waive the payment of tuition at the Connecticut State University System for such veteran in accordance with subdivision (2) of this subsection.

Such portion shall be calculated by multiplying (i) the total amount of such federal educational assistance to be paid to the Connecticut State University System on behalf of such veteran by (ii) an amount obtained by dividing (I) the actual tuition charged by the Connecticut State University System to such veteran by (II) the sum of the actual tuition and fees charged by the Connecticut State University System to such veteran.\n\n(B) Said board of trustees shall waive the payment of tuition in excess of the veteran tuition benefit at the Connecticut State University System for such veteran.\n\n(f) Said board shall set aside from its anticipated tuition revenue, an amount not less than that required by the board of governors' tuition policy established under subdivision (3) of subsection (a) of section 10a-6 . Such funds shall be used to provide tuition waivers, tuition remissions, grants for educational expenses and student employment for any undergraduate or graduate student who is enrolled as a full or part-time matriculated student in a degree-granting program, or enrolled in a precollege remedial program, and who demonstrates substantial financial need. Said board may also set aside from its anticipated tuition revenue an additional amount equal to one per cent of said tuition revenue for financial assistance for students who would not otherwise be eligible for financial assistance but who do have a financial need as determined by the university in accordance with this subsection. In determining such financial need, the university shall exclude the value of equity in the principal residence of the student's parents or legal guardians, or in the student's principal residence if the student is not considered to be a dependent of his parents or legal guardians and shall assess the earnings of a dependent student at the rate of thirty per cent.\n\n(g) The Connecticut State University System Operating Fund shall be reimbursed for the amount by which the tuition waivers granted under subsection (d) of this section exceed two and one-half per cent of tuition revenue through an annual state appropriation. The board of trustees shall request such an appropriation and said appropriation shall be based upon an estimate of tuition revenue loss using tuition rates in effect for the fiscal year in which such appropriation will apply.\n\n(h) Said board of trustees shall allow any student who is a member of the armed forces called to active duty during any semester to enroll in any course for which such student had remitted tuition but which was not completed due to active duty status. Such course reenrollment shall be offered to any qualifying student for a period not exceeding four years after the date of release from active duty without additional tuition, student fee or related charge, except if such student has been fully reimbursed for the tuition, fees and charges for the course that was not completed.\n\n(i) The Board of Regents for Higher Education shall not assess or charge a graduation fee to any student enrolled in the Connecticut State University System for the purpose of graduating from a state university within such system.\n\nSee Sec. 4-73a re determination of actual rate for fringe benefits for funds of the constituent units of the state system of higher education.\n\nSee Sec. 10a-104b for definition of “specified terrorist victim”."

Such course reenrollment shall be offered to any qualifying student for a period not exceeding four years after the date of release from active duty without additional tuition, student fee or related charge, except if such student has been fully reimbursed for the tuition, fees and charges for the course that was not completed.\n\n(l) The Board of Trustees of The University of Connecticut shall not assess or charge a graduation fee to any student enrolled in The University of Connecticut for the purpose of graduating from such university.\n\nSee Sec. 4-73a re determination of actual rate for fringe benefits for funds of the constituent units of the state system of higher education.\n\nSee Sec. 10a-104b for definition of “specified terrorist victim”."

              "(h) Money borrowed and securities issued and delivered by the university shall not constitute a debt or liability of the state or of any municipality or any political subdivision of the state, but shall be payable solely from the resources of the university described in and pursuant to the indenture of trust or resolution under which they are issued, and all such securities shall contain on their face a statement to that effect. The borrowing of money and the issuance of securities by the university shall not directly or indirectly or contingently obligate the state or any municipality or political subdivision to levy or to pledge any form of taxation and such securities shall not constitute an indebtedness of the state within the meaning of any constitutional or statutory debt limitation or restriction and accordingly, shall not be subject to any statutory limitation on the indebtedness of the state and such securities, when issued, shall not be included in computing the aggregate indebtedness of the state in respect to and to the extent of any such limitation, except that the amount of securities in each fiscal year in which the General Assembly has authorized the board of trustees to provide for the issuance and sale of securities pursuant to subsection (a) of this section for purposes of section 3-21 , but subject to the exclusions or deductions provided in said section 3-21 , shall be deemed to be indebtedness of the state until deemed paid or retired. For any years for which there is not an estimate of net tax revenues, the Wharton Econometric Forecasting Associates projection of consumer price index growth shall be applied to the most recently adopted state revenue estimate and shall be deemed to satisfy the provisions of subsection (d) of said section 3-21 .",
              "(i) In connection with the issuance of securities, the university may create and establish one or more reserve funds to be known as special capital reserve funds and may pay into such special capital reserve funds (1) any moneys appropriated and made available by the state for the purposes of such funds, (2) any proceeds of sale of securities, to the extent provided in the resolution of the university authorizing the issuance thereof, and (3) any other moneys which may be made available to the university for the purpose of such funds from any other source or sources. The moneys held in or credited to any special capital reserve fund established under this subsection, except as provided in this subsection, shall be used solely for the payment of the principal of special obligation securities of the university secured by such special capital reserve fund as the same become due, the purchase of such special obligation securities of the university, the payment of interest on such special obligation securities of the university or the payment of any redemption premium required to be paid when such special obligation securities are redeemed prior to maturity; provided the university may provide that moneys in any such fund shall not be withdrawn therefrom at any time in such amount as would reduce the amount of such funds to less than the maximum amount of principal and interest becoming due by reason of maturity or a required sinking fund installment in the succeeding calendar year on the special obligation securities of the university then outstanding and secured by such special capital reserve fund or such lesser amount specified by the university in its resolution authorizing the issuance of any such special obligation securities, such amount being referred to in this subsection as the “required minimum capital reserve”, except for the purpose of paying such principal of, redemption premium and interest on such special obligation securities of the university secured by such special capital reserve becoming due and for the payment of which other moneys of the university are not available. The university may provide that it shall not issue special obligation securities at any time if the required minimum capital reserve on the special obligation securities outstanding and the special obligation securities then to be issued and secured by a special capital reserve fund will exceed the amount of such special capital reserve fund at the time of issuance, unless the university, at the time of the issuance of such special obligation securities, shall deposit in such special capital reserve fund from the proceeds of the special obligation securities so to be issued, or otherwise, an amount which, together with the amount then in such special capital reserve fund, will be not less than the required minimum capital reserve. On or before December first, annually, there is deemed to be appropriated from the state General Fund such sums, if any, as shall be certified by the chairperson of the board of trustees to the Secretary of the Office of Policy and Management and Treasurer of the state, as necessary to restore each such special capital reserve fund to the amount equal to the required minimum capital reserve of such fund, and such amounts shall be allotted and paid to the university for deposit therein. For the purpose of evaluation of any such special capital reserve fund, obligations acquired as an investment for any such fund shall be valued at amortized costs. Nothing contained in this section or section 10a-105 shall preclude the university from establishing and creating other debt service reserve funds in connection with the issuance of securities of the university. Subject to any agreement or agreements with holders of outstanding special obligation securities of the university, any amount or amounts allotted and paid to the university by the state pursuant to this section shall be repaid to the state from moneys of the university at such time as such moneys are not required for any other of its corporate purposes and in any event shall be repaid to the state on the date one year after all special obligation securities of the university theretofore issued on the date or dates such amount or amounts are allotted and paid to the university or thereafter issued, together with interest on such special obligation securities, with interest on any unpaid installments of interest and all costs and expenses in connection with any action or proceeding by or on behalf of the holders thereof, are fully met and discharged. A special capital reserve fund shall not be created, established or applicable or available pursuant to this subsection unless the board of trustees of the university is of the opinion and determines its self-sufficiency in that (A) project revenues or assured revenues, other than those to be derived from the state debt service commitment and the minimum state operating provision, and as a result of the implementation of its rate covenant, are estimated and expected, assuming continued compliance by the state and the university with the provisions of sections 10a-109a to 10a-109y , inclusive, be sufficient (i) to pay the applicable special debt service requirements on special obligation securities, (ii) to establish, increase and maintain any reserves deemed by the university to be advisable to secure the payment of the special debt service requirements on such special obligation securities and to maintain its renewal and replacement fund and (iii) to operate and maintain in a prudent and economical manner the physical infrastructure of the university and (B) the university has recently reviewed and resolved that it is in compliance with its rate covenant referred to in section 10a-109e . Prior to the issuance of special obligation securities, the security for which is to be enhanced by such a special capital reserve fund, the aforementioned self-sufficiency finding by the university shall be submitted to and confirmed as not unreasonable or arbitrary in the certificate of determination referred to in subsection (e) of this section by the Treasurer of the state. In addition, a special capital reserve fund shall be used only if such use improves or is essential to the rating of the securities or provides interest savings as determined by the Treasurer of the state. The provisions of this subsection respecting the creation, establishment and enhancement of a special capital reserve fund shall not be available or applicable to any general obligation securities issued by the university pursuant to sections 10a-109a to 10a-109y , inclusive."

The resolution providing for the issuance of securities, and any indenture or resolution securing such securities, may contain such limitations upon the issuance of additional securities as the university may deem proper, and such additional securities shall be issued under such restrictions and limitations as may be prescribed by such indenture or resolution, provided, no such resolution or indenture shall include a covenant committing the university to the issuance of additional securities secured by a pledge of the state debt service commitment. The university may provide for the replacement of any securities which become mutilated, or are destroyed, stolen or lost. Securities may be issued under sections 10a-109a to 10a-109y , inclusive, without obtaining the consent of any department, division, commission, board, bureau, or agency of the state and without any other proceedings or the happening of any other conditions or things other than those proceedings, conditions or things which are specifically required by sections 10a-109a to 10a-109y , inclusive.\n\n(h) Money borrowed and securities issued and delivered by the university shall not constitute a debt or liability of the state or of any municipality or any political subdivision of the state, but shall be payable solely from the resources of the university described in and pursuant to the indenture of trust or resolution under which they are issued, and all such securities shall contain on their face a statement to that effect. The borrowing of money and the issuance of securities by the university shall not directly or indirectly or contingently obligate the state or any municipality or political subdivision to levy or to pledge any form of taxation and such securities shall not constitute an indebtedness of the state within the meaning of any constitutional or statutory debt limitation or restriction and accordingly, shall not be subject to any statutory limitation on the indebtedness of the state and such securities, when issued, shall not be included in computing the aggregate indebtedness of the state in respect to and to the extent of any such limitation, except that the amount of securities in each fiscal year in which the General Assembly has authorized the board of trustees to provide for the issuance and sale of securities pursuant to subsection (a) of this section for purposes of section 3-21 , but subject to the exclusions or deductions provided in said section 3-21 , shall be deemed to be indebtedness of the state until deemed paid or retired. For any years for which there is not an estimate of net tax revenues, the Wharton Econometric Forecasting Associates projection of consumer price index growth shall be applied to the most recently adopted state revenue estimate and shall be deemed to satisfy the provisions of subsection (d) of said section 3-21 .\n\n(i) In connection with the issuance of securities, the university may create and establish one or more reserve funds to be known as special capital reserve funds and may pay into such special capital reserve funds (1) any moneys appropriated and made available by the state for the purposes of such funds, (2) any proceeds of sale of securities, to the extent provided in the resolution of the university authorizing the issuance thereof, and (3) any other moneys which may be made available to the university for the purpose of such funds from any other source or sources. The moneys held in or credited to any special capital reserve fund established under this subsection, except as provided in this subsection, shall be used solely for the payment of the principal of special obligation securities of the university secured by such special capital reserve fund as the same become due, the purchase of such special obligation securities of the university, the payment of interest on such special obligation securities of the university or the payment of any redemption premium required to be paid when such special obligation securities are redeemed prior to maturity; provided the university may provide that moneys in any such fund shall not be withdrawn therefrom at any time in such amount as would reduce the amount of such funds to less than the maximum amount of principal and interest becoming due by reason of maturity or a required sinking fund installment in the succeeding calendar year on the special obligation securities of the university then outstanding and secured by such special capital reserve fund or such lesser amount specified by the university in its resolution authorizing the issuance of any such special obligation securities, such amount being referred to in this subsection as the “required minimum capital reserve”, except for the purpose of paying such principal of, redemption premium and interest on such special obligation securities of the university secured by such special capital reserve becoming due and for the payment of which other moneys of the university are not available. The university may provide that it shall not issue special obligation securities at any time if the required minimum capital reserve on the special obligation securities outstanding and the special obligation securities then to be issued and secured by a special capital reserve fund will exceed the amount of such special capital reserve fund at the time of issuance, unless the university, at the time of the issuance of such special obligation securities, shall deposit in such special capital reserve fund from the proceeds of the special obligation securities so to be issued, or otherwise, an amount which, together with the amount then in such special capital reserve fund, will be not less than the required minimum capital reserve. On or before December first, annually, there is deemed to be appropriated from the state General Fund such sums, if any, as shall be certified by the chairperson of the board of trustees to the Secretary of the Office of Policy and Management and Treasurer of the state, as necessary to restore each such special capital reserve fund to the amount equal to the required minimum capital reserve of such fund, and such amounts shall be allotted and paid to the university for deposit therein. For the purpose of evaluation of any such special capital reserve fund, obligations acquired as an investment for any such fund shall be valued at amortized costs. Nothing contained in this section or section 10a-105 shall preclude the university from establishing and creating other debt service reserve funds in connection with the issuance of securities of the university. Subject to any agreement or agreements with holders of outstanding special obligation securities of the university, any amount or amounts allotted and paid to the university by the state pursuant to this section shall be repaid to the state from moneys of the university at such time as such moneys are not required for any other of its corporate purposes and in any event shall be repaid to the state on the date one year after all special obligation securities of the university theretofore issued on the date or dates such amount or amounts are allotted and paid to the university or thereafter issued, together with interest on such special obligation securities, with interest on any unpaid installments of interest and all costs and expenses in connection with any action or proceeding by or on behalf of the holders thereof, are fully met and discharged. A special capital reserve fund shall not be created, established or applicable or available pursuant to this subsection unless the board of trustees of the university is of the opinion and determines its self-sufficiency in that (A) project revenues or assured revenues, other than those to be derived from the state debt service commitment and the minimum state operating provision, and as a result of the implementation of its rate covenant, are estimated and expected, assuming continued compliance by the state and the university with the provisions of sections 10a-109a to 10a-109y , inclusive, be sufficient (i) to pay the applicable special debt service requirements on special obligation securities, (ii) to establish, increase and maintain any reserves deemed by the university to be advisable to secure the payment of the special debt service requirements on such special obligation securities and to maintain its renewal and replacement fund and (iii) to operate and maintain in a prudent and economical manner the physical infrastructure of the university and (B) the university has recently reviewed and resolved that it is in compliance with its rate covenant referred to in section 10a-109e . Prior to the issuance of special obligation securities, the security for which is to be enhanced by such a special capital reserve fund, the aforementioned self-sufficiency finding by the university shall be submitted to and confirmed as not unreasonable or arbitrary in the certificate of determination referred to in subsection (e) of this section by the Treasurer of the state. In addition, a special capital reserve fund shall be used only if such use improves or is essential to the rating of the securities or provides interest savings as determined by the Treasurer of the state. The provisions of this subsection respecting the creation, establishment and enhancement of a special capital reserve fund shall not be available or applicable to any general obligation securities issued by the university pursuant to sections 10a-109a to 10a-109y , inclusive."

As used in this section, the term commissioner shall mean commissioners if more than one commissioner has jurisdiction over the subject matter and their designee, if any. No agency, commission, council, committee, panel or other body whatsoever other than such commissioner shall have jurisdiction over or cognizance of any licenses, permits, approvals or administrative actions concerning any project and no notice of any tentative determination or any final determination regarding any such license, permit, approval or administrative action and no notice of any such license, permit, approval or administrative action shall be required except as expressly provided pursuant to this subsection. For purposes of sections 10a-109a to 10a-109y , inclusive, a capital project is a state facility and accordingly, no ordinance, law or regulation promulgated by or any authority granted to any municipality or any other political subdivision of the state shall apply to a capital project.

Such commissioner may issue licenses and permits, give such approval and take such administrative action as shall be necessary or desirable.",
              "(2) All applications, supporting documentation and other records submitted to the commissioner and pertaining to any application for any license, permit, approval or other administrative action, together with all records of the proceedings of the commissioner relating to any license, permit, approval or administrative action shall be a public record and shall be made, maintained and disclosed in accordance with the Freedom of Information Act, as defined in section 1-200 .",
              "(3) All applications for licenses, permits, approvals and other administrative action required by any applicable provision of the general statutes shall be submitted to the commissioner as provided in subdivision (1) of this subsection.",
              "(4) (A) Any hearing regarding all or any part of any project, provided for by this section, shall be conducted by the particular commissioner having jurisdiction over the applicable license, permit, approval or other administrative action. Legal notice of such hearing shall be published in a newspaper having general circulation in an area which includes the municipality in which the particular part of such project is proposed to be built or is being built not more than ten nor less than five days in advance of such hearing.",
              "(B) In rendering any decision in connection with any project, the commissioner shall weigh all competent material and substantial evidence presented by the applicant and the public in accordance with the applicable statute. The commissioner shall issue written findings and determinations upon which the commissioner's decision is based. Such findings and determinations shall consist of evidence presented, including such matters as the commissioner deems appropriate, provided such matters, to the extent applicable to the particular permit, shall include the nature of any major adverse health and environmental impact of any project. The commissioner may reverse or modify any order or action at any time on the commissioner's own motion. The procedure for such reversal or modification shall be the same as the procedure for the original proceeding.",
              "(C) Any administrative action taken by any commissioner in connection with any project may be appealed by an aggrieved party to the superior court for the judicial district of New Britain in accordance with the provisions of section 4-183 , except as otherwise provided in sections 10a-109a to 10a-109y , inclusive. Such appeal shall be brought not later than ten days after the date of mailing to the parties to the proceeding of a notice of such order, decision or action by certified mail, return receipt requested, and the appellant shall serve a copy of the appeal on each party listed in the final decision at the address shown in such decision. Failure to make such service within such ten days on parties other than the commissioner who rendered the final decision may not, in the discretion of the court, deprive the court of jurisdiction over such appeal. Within ten days after the service of such appeal, or within such further time as may be allowed by the court, the commissioner who rendered such decision shall cause any portion of the record that had not been transcribed to be transcribed and shall cause either the original or a certified copy of the entire record of the proceeding appealed from to be transmitted to the reviewing court. Such record shall include the commissioner's findings of fact and conclusions of law, separately stated. If more than one commissioner has jurisdiction over the matter, such commissioners shall issue joint findings of fact and conclusions of law. Such appeal shall state the reasons upon which it is predicated and, notwithstanding any provision of the general statutes, shall not stay the development of any project. The commissioner who rendered such decision shall appear as the respondent. Such appeals to the superior court shall each be privileged matters and shall be heard as soon after the return date as practicable. A court shall render its decision not later than twenty-one days after the date that the entire record, with the transcript, is filed with the court by the commissioner who rendered the decision.",
              "(D) The court shall not substitute its judgment for that of the commissioner as to the weight of the evidence presented on a question of fact. The court shall affirm the decision of the commissioner unless the court finds that substantial rights of the party appealing such decision have been materially prejudiced because the findings, inferences, conclusions or decisions of the commissioner are: (i) In violation of constitutional or statutory provisions, (ii) in excess of the statutory authority of the commissioner, (iii) made upon unlawful procedure, (iv) affected by an error of law, (v) clearly erroneous in view of the reliable, probative and substantial evidence on the whole record, or (vi) arbitrary, capricious or characterized by abuse of discretion or clearly unwarranted exercise of discretion.",
              "(E) If the court finds material prejudice, it may sustain the appeal. Upon sustaining an appeal, the court may render a judgment which modifies the decision of the commissioner, orders particular action of the commissioner or orders the commissioner to take such action as may be necessary to effect a particular action and the commissioner may issue a permit consistent with such judgment. Notwithstanding the foregoing, an applicant may file an amended application and the commissioner may, pursuant to the procedures set forth in sections 10a-109a to 10a-109y , inclusive, consider an amended application for an order, permit or other administrative action following court action.",
              "(F) Notwithstanding the provisions of section 3-125 , in consultation with the Attorney General, the university may use the legal services of any private attorney, in connection with the construction, operation and maintenance of any project. The board of trustees shall determine the effective and efficient method or methods of legal services to accomplish the construction, operation and maintenance of all projects, taking into account the capacity, cost and expense of private counsel for such services and the capacity and direct and indirect cost and expense of and identified by the Attorney General for such services.",
              "(f) On or before December thirty-first and June thirtieth of each year, the university shall submit a report to the joint standing committee of the General Assembly having cognizance of matters relating to finance, revenue and bonding. Such report shall include the following information: (1) The names and addresses of contractors and subcontractors performing repair, addition, alteration and new construction on the university's campuses in the previous six calendar months, (2) the extent to which such contractors and subcontractors have been in compliance with the provisions of part III of chapter 557 and the provisions of chapter 558, and (3) any actions taken by the university to cooperate with the Labor Department in the enforcement of said provisions."

Each construction manager at-risk shall invite bids and give notice of opportunities to bid on project elements, by posting any such invitation or notice on the State Contracting Portal. Each bid shall be kept sealed until opened publicly at the time and place as set forth in the notice soliciting such bid. The construction manager at-risk shall, after consultation with and approval by the university, award any related contracts for project elements to the responsible qualified contractor, who shall be prequalified pursuant to section 4a-100 , submitting the lowest bid in compliance with the bid requirements, provided (i) the construction manager at-risk shall not be eligible to submit a bid for any such project element, and (ii) construction shall not begin prior to the determination of the maximum guaranteed price, except (I) for the project elements of site preparation and demolition that have been previously put out to bid and awarded, and (II) for the project elements of site preparation, demolition, public utility installation and connections and building envelope components, including the roof, doors, windows and exterior walls, as provided in subparagraph (B) of this subdivision.\n\n(B) Construction may begin prior to the determination of the maximum guaranteed price for the project elements of site preparation, demolition, public utility installation and connections and building envelope components, including the roof, doors, windows and exterior walls, provided (i) the project involves the renovation of an existing building or facility; (ii) the project element or elements involved in such early work have been previously put out to bid and awarded; and (iii) the total cost of construction of the early work does not exceed twenty-five per cent of the estimated cost of construction for the entire project.\n\n(C) If such project involves the renovation of an existing building or facility that will be performed in multiple phases while such building or facility remains occupied, the university may enter into a construction manager at-risk project delivery contract that provides for the maximum guaranteed price to be determined for each phase of the project, prior to beginning each such phase, provided each party to the contract complies with all of the requirements of subparagraph (A) of this subdivision, except the timing of the determination of the maximum guaranteed price set forth in subparagraph (A)(ii) of this subdivision.\n\n(10) If the university designates a project as suitable for a design-build contract, the university may enter into a single contract with a design-builder recommended by a selection panel and selected by the university. The university shall give notice of such project and specifications for such project by posting such notice on the State Contracting Portal. The university shall establish a selection panel for each project to score the qualifications and past performance of each design-builder who submits a competitive proposal to the university for such project. The selection panel shall score the qualifications and past performance of each design-builder using a predetermined scoring method developed by the university and provided to each design-builder in advance of such design-builder's development of the competitive proposal. The selection panel's scoring method may be unique to each project, but shall consist of combining the score of each design-builder's qualifications and past performance and evaluating the technical merit of the competitive proposal and each design-builder's projected project cost. The design-build contract shall (A) include, but not be limited to, such project elements as permitting, engineering, design, construction and, if applicable, site acquisition, and (B) be based on the competitive proposal submitted by the design-builder that is selected by the university. No design-build contract for which the total cost is estimated to be more than the amount set forth in subdivision (2) of subsection (a) of section 4b-91 may be awarded to a design-builder who is not prequalified for the project in accordance with section 4a-100 . Such design-build contracts shall state the responsibilities of the design-builder to deliver a completed and acceptable project on a date certain and the maximum costs of the project and, if applicable, as a separate item, the cost of any site acquisition. The university shall determine all other requirements and conditions for such competitive proposals, selection of a design-builder and other awards and shall have sole responsibility for all other aspects of such design-build contracts.\n\n(d) For the purposes of part III of chapter 557, a project undertaken by the university shall be deemed to be a state public works project and consist of public buildings.\n\n(e) (1) Notwithstanding any provision of the general statutes, any license, permit, and approval required or permitted to be issued and any administrative action required or permitted to be taken pursuant to the general statutes in connection with any project by the university shall be issued or taken upon application to the particular commissioner or commissioners having jurisdiction over such license, permit, approval or other administrative action or such other state official as such commissioner shall designate. As used in this section, the term commissioner shall mean commissioners if more than one commissioner has jurisdiction over the subject matter and their designee, if any. No agency, commission, council, committee, panel or other body whatsoever other than such commissioner shall have jurisdiction over or cognizance of any licenses, permits, approvals or administrative actions concerning any project and no notice of any tentative determination or any final determination regarding any such license, permit, approval or administrative action and no notice of any such license, permit, approval or administrative action shall be required except as expressly provided pursuant to this subsection. For purposes of sections 10a-109a to 10a-109y , inclusive, a capital project is a state facility and accordingly, no ordinance, law or regulation promulgated by or any authority granted to any municipality or any other political subdivision of the state shall apply to a capital project. The State Properties Review Board shall have jurisdiction over any project in the same manner as provided in chapter 60 for a priority higher education facility project. Such commissioner may issue licenses and permits, give such approval and take such administrative action as shall be necessary or desirable.\n\n(2) All applications, supporting documentation and other records submitted to the commissioner and pertaining to any application for any license, permit, approval or other administrative action, together with all records of the proceedings of the commissioner relating to any license, permit, approval or administrative action shall be a public record and shall be made, maintained and disclosed in accordance with the Freedom of Information Act, as defined in section 1-200 .\n\n(3) All applications for licenses, permits, approvals and other administrative action required by any applicable provision of the general statutes shall be submitted to the commissioner as provided in subdivision (1) of this subsection.\n\n(4) (A) Any hearing regarding all or any part of any project, provided for by this section, shall be conducted by the particular commissioner having jurisdiction over the applicable license, permit, approval or other administrative action. Legal notice of such hearing shall be published in a newspaper having general circulation in an area which includes the municipality in which the particular part of such project is proposed to be built or is being built not more than ten nor less than five days in advance of such hearing.\n\n(B) In rendering any decision in connection with any project, the commissioner shall weigh all competent material and substantial evidence presented by the applicant and the public in accordance with the applicable statute. The commissioner shall issue written findings and determinations upon which the commissioner's decision is based. Such findings and determinations shall consist of evidence presented, including such matters as the commissioner deems appropriate, provided such matters, to the extent applicable to the particular permit, shall include the nature of any major adverse health and environmental impact of any project. The commissioner may reverse or modify any order or action at any time on the commissioner's own motion. The procedure for such reversal or modification shall be the same as the procedure for the original proceeding.\n\n(C) Any administrative action taken by any commissioner in connection with any project may be appealed by an aggrieved party to the superior court for the judicial district of New Britain in accordance with the provisions of section 4-183 , except as otherwise provided in sections 10a-109a to 10a-109y , inclusive. Such appeal shall be brought not later than ten days after the date of mailing to the parties to the proceeding of a notice of such order, decision or action by certified mail, return receipt requested, and the appellant shall serve a copy of the appeal on each party listed in the final decision at the address shown in such decision. Failure to make such service within such ten days on parties other than the commissioner who rendered the final decision may not, in the discretion of the court, deprive the court of jurisdiction over such appeal. Within ten days after the service of such appeal, or within such further time as may be allowed by the court, the commissioner who rendered such decision shall cause any portion of the record that had not been transcribed to be transcribed and shall cause either the original or a certified copy of the entire record of the proceeding appealed from to be transmitted to the reviewing court. Such record shall include the commissioner's findings of fact and conclusions of law, separately stated. If more than one commissioner has jurisdiction over the matter, such commissioners shall issue joint findings of fact and conclusions of law. Such appeal shall state the reasons upon which it is predicated and, notwithstanding any provision of the general statutes, shall not stay the development of any project. The commissioner who rendered such decision shall appear as the respondent. Such appeals to the superior court shall each be privileged matters and shall be heard as soon after the return date as practicable. A court shall render its decision not later than twenty-one days after the date that the entire record, with the transcript, is filed with the court by the commissioner who rendered the decision.\n\n(D) The court shall not substitute its judgment for that of the commissioner as to the weight of the evidence presented on a question of fact. The court shall affirm the decision of the commissioner unless the court finds that substantial rights of the party appealing such decision have been materially prejudiced because the findings, inferences, conclusions or decisions of the commissioner are: (i) In violation of constitutional or statutory provisions, (ii) in excess of the statutory authority of the commissioner, (iii) made upon unlawful procedure, (iv) affected by an error of law, (v) clearly erroneous in view of the reliable, probative and substantial evidence on the whole record, or (vi) arbitrary, capricious or characterized by abuse of discretion or clearly unwarranted exercise of discretion.\n\n(E) If the court finds material prejudice, it may sustain the appeal. Upon sustaining an appeal, the court may render a judgment which modifies the decision of the commissioner, orders particular action of the commissioner or orders the commissioner to take such action as may be necessary to effect a particular action and the commissioner may issue a permit consistent with such judgment. Notwithstanding the foregoing, an applicant may file an amended application and the commissioner may, pursuant to the procedures set forth in sections 10a-109a to 10a-109y , inclusive, consider an amended application for an order, permit or other administrative action following court action.\n\n(F) Notwithstanding the provisions of section 3-125 , in consultation with the Attorney General, the university may use the legal services of any private attorney, in connection with the construction, operation and maintenance of any project. The board of trustees shall determine the effective and efficient method or methods of legal services to accomplish the construction, operation and maintenance of all projects, taking into account the capacity, cost and expense of private counsel for such services and the capacity and direct and indirect cost and expense of and identified by the Attorney General for such services.\n\n(f) On or before December thirty-first and June thirtieth of each year, the university shall submit a report to the joint standing committee of the General Assembly having cognizance of matters relating to finance, revenue and bonding. Such report shall include the following information: (1) The names and addresses of contractors and subcontractors performing repair, addition, alteration and new construction on the university's campuses in the previous six calendar months, (2) the extent to which such contractors and subcontractors have been in compliance with the provisions of part III of chapter 557 and the provisions of chapter 558, and (3) any actions taken by the university to cooperate with the Labor Department in the enforcement of said provisions."

This section, being necessary for the welfare of the state and its inhabitants, shall be liberally construed to affect its purpose. None of the powers granted to the corporation or to any subsidiary created pursuant to subdivision (5) of section 10a-204 under the provisions of this section shall be subject to the supervision or regulation or require the approval or consent of any municipality or political subdivision or any department, division, commission, board, body, bureau, official or agency thereof or of the state, and the exercise thereof shall not cause the corporation or any such subsidiary to be construed to be an agency within the scope of chapter 54 or a department, institution or agency of the state.",

The income, revenue or other property so pledged and thereafter received by or on behalf of the corporation or of the subsidiary, as applicable, shall immediately be subject to the lien of such pledge without any physical delivery thereof or further act, and the lien of any such pledge shall be valid and binding as against all parties having claims of any kind in tort, contract or otherwise against the corporation or against the subsidiary, as applicable, irrespective of whether such parties have notice thereof. Any such lien shall have priority over all other liens, including, without limitation, the lien of any person who in the ordinary course of business furnishes services or materials to the corporation or to the subsidiary, as applicable. Notwithstanding any provision of the general statutes, neither possession nor the filing of any financing or continuation statement or other instrument shall be necessary with respect to any such income, revenues or other property to establish or evidence the lien of any such pledge with respect thereto. Neither this section, nor any resolution authorizing bonds, notes or other obligations, nor any trust agreement nor any other instrument by which such a pledge is created need be recorded. Any pledge or lien described by this subsection shall be conclusively deemed to be a pledge or lien described by subdivision (14) of subsection (d) of section 42a-9-109 , notwithstanding that the corporation is not, and that any such subsidiary shall not be, either a political subdivision or an agency of the state.\n\n(j) The corporation or any subsidiary created pursuant to subdivision (5) of section 10a-204 is authorized and empowered to obtain from any department, agency or instrumentality of the United States any insurance or guarantee as to, or of or for the payment or repayment of, interest or principal, or both, or any part thereof, on any loans, or on any bonds, notes or other obligations issued by the corporation or by the subsidiary, as applicable, pursuant to the provisions of this section and, notwithstanding any other provisions of this chapter, to enter into any agreement, contract or any other instrument whatsoever with respect to any such insurance or guarantee or with respect to the origination, servicing, collection and administration of loans, except to the extent that such action would in any way impair or interfere with the ability of the corporation or of the subsidiary, as applicable, to perform and fulfill the terms of any agreement made with the holders of its bonds, notes or other obligations of the corporation or subsidiary.\n\n(k) None of the members of the board of directors of the corporation, or the members of the board of directors of the subsidiary created pursuant to subdivision (5) of section 10a-204 or any person executing bonds, notes or other obligations issued pursuant to this section shall be liable personally on such bonds, notes or other obligations by reason of the issuance thereof. Any resolution authorizing the issuance of bonds, notes or other obligations may provide for the indemnification by the issuer of the members of the board of directors of the corporation or the members of the board of directors of such a subsidiary and of any such person executing such bonds, notes or other obligations with respect to such bonds, notes or other obligations and the issuance thereof.\n\n(l) The corporation and any subsidiary created pursuant to subdivision (5) of section 10a-204 shall have power to purchase, hold and resell bonds, notes or other obligations of the corporation or of any such subsidiary out of any funds available therefor. The issuer of such bonds, notes or other obligations may hold, cancel or resell such bonds, notes or other obligations subject to and in accordance with agreements with holders of its bonds, notes and other obligations.\n\n(m) All moneys received by or on behalf of the corporation or by or on behalf of a subsidiary created pursuant to subdivision (5) of section 10a-204 , as applicable, pursuant to or subject to the pledge of any resolution or trust agreement authorized by this section, whether as proceeds from the sale of bonds or as revenues, shall be deemed to be trust funds to be held and applied solely as provided in such resolution or trust agreement. Subject to the provisions of any resolution authorizing the issuance of bonds, notes or other obligations, any such moneys may be invested in the Connecticut Short-Term Investment Fund and in such other investments and investment agreements as may be approved by resolution of the issuer. The issuer shall fund borrower fee reductions, interest rate reductions, rebates, loan forgiveness or other borrower benefits allowable under the programs authorized by this chapter in an aggregate annual amount at least equal to the net reduction in program financing cost achieved by the issuer in each year through the issuance of private activity bonds, as defined in section 32-140 , taking into account any federal loan program terms and any federal loan program or tax requirements resulting from such financing. Any officer with whom, or any bank or trust company with which, such moneys shall be deposited shall act as trustee of such moneys and shall hold and apply the same for the purposes hereof, subject to such regulations as this chapter and the resolution authorizing the bonds of any issue or the trust agreement securing such bonds may provide.\n\n(n) Any holder of bonds, notes or other obligations issued under the provisions of this section or any of the coupons appertaining thereto, and the trustee or trustees under any trust agreement, except to the extent the rights herein given may be restricted by any resolution authorizing the issuance of, or any such trust agreement securing, such bonds, notes or other obligations, may, either at law or in equity, by suit, action, mandamus or other proceedings, protect and enforce any and all rights under the laws of the state or granted hereunder or under such resolution or trust agreement, and may enforce and compel the performance of all duties required by this section or by such resolution or trust agreement to be performed by the issuer or by any officer, employee or agent of the issuer, including the appointment of a receiver to administer any loans or other pledged assets and revenues.\n\n(o) The corporation and any subsidiary created pursuant to subdivision (5) of section 10a-204 is authorized and empowered, from time to time, to issue bonds, notes or other obligations the interest on which, if so designated by resolution of the issuer, shall be includable in the gross income of the holder or holders of such bonds, notes or other obligations under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 or any subsequent corresponding internal revenue code of the United States, as from time to time amended, and in the same manner that interest on bills, bonds, notes or other obligations of the United States is includable in the gross income of the holder or holders thereof under said Internal Revenue Code; the state hereby consents to such inclusion only for the bonds, notes and other obligations of the corporation or such a subsidiary, as applicable, authorized by this section.\n\n(p) In connection with, or incidental to, the issuance or carrying of bonds, notes or other obligations, or acquisition or carrying of any investment or program of investment, the corporation or any subsidiary created pursuant to subdivision (5) of section 10a-204 may enter into any contract with any financial institution having a rating of at least “A”, or into any contract secured by security so rated, which the issuer determines to be necessary or appropriate to place the obligation or investment of the issuer, as represented by the bonds, notes or other obligations, investment or program of investment and the contract or contracts, in whole or in part, on the interest rate cash flow or other basis desired by the issuer.\n\n(q) In connection with, or incidental to, the issuance or carrying of bonds, notes or other obligations or entering into any of the contracts or agreements referred to in subsection (p) of this section, the corporation or any subsidiary created pursuant to subdivision (5) of section 10a-204 may enter into credit enhancement or liquidity agreements, with payment, interest rate, security, default, remedy and other terms and conditions as the issuer determines.\n\n(r) The state covenants with the purchasers and all other subsequent owners and transferees of bonds, notes or other obligations issued by the corporation or by any subsidiary created pursuant to subdivision (5) of section 10a-204 pursuant to this section, in consideration of the acceptance of and payment for the bonds, notes or other obligations, until the bonds, notes or other obligations, together with the interest thereon, with interest on any unpaid installment of interest and all costs and expenses in connection with any action or proceeding on behalf of the owners, are fully met and discharged or unless expressly permitted or otherwise authorized by the terms of each contract and agreement made or entered into by or on behalf of the issuer with or for the benefit of such owners, that the state: (1) Will not create or cause to be created any lien or charge on the assets or revenues pledged to secure such bonds, notes or other obligations, other than a lien or pledge created thereon pursuant to this section; (2) will not in any way impair the rights, exemptions or remedies of the owners; and (3) will not limit, modify, rescind, repeal or otherwise alter the rights or obligations of the issuer to take such action as may be necessary to fulfill the terms of the resolution authorizing the issuance of the bonds, notes or other obligations; provided nothing in this section shall preclude the state from exercising its power, through a change in law, to limit, modify, rescind, repeal or otherwise alter this chapter if and when adequate provision shall be made by law for the protection of the holders of outstanding bonds, notes or other obligations, pursuant to the resolution under which the bonds, notes or other obligations are issued. The state further covenants with the purchasers and all subsequent owners and transferees of bonds, notes or other obligations issued by the corporation or by such a subsidiary pursuant to this section, in consideration of the acceptance of and payment for the bonds, notes or other obligations that, notwithstanding any provision of title 12, the bonds, notes or other obligations shall be free at all times from taxes levied by any municipality or political subdivision or special district having taxing powers of the state, and the principal and interest of any bonds, notes or other obligations issued under the provisions of this section, the transfer of such bonds, notes or other obligations and the income from such bonds, notes or other obligations, including any profit on the sale or transfer of such bonds, notes or other obligations, shall at all times be exempt from any taxation by the state or under its authority, except for estate or succession taxes. The issuer is authorized to include covenants of the state provided for in this subsection, as a contract of the state, in any agreement with the owners of any bonds, notes or other obligations, in any credit facility or reimbursement agreement with respect to the bonds, notes or other obligations and in any agreement authorized by subsection (p) or (q) of this section.\n\n(s) The provisions of this section shall be deemed to provide a complete, additional and alternative method for the actions and the things authorized thereby and shall be regarded as supplemental and additional to powers granted by other laws; the issuance of bonds, notes or other obligations under the provisions of this section need not comply with the requirements of any law applicable to the issuance of bonds, notes or other obligations. This section, being necessary for the welfare of the state and its inhabitants, shall be liberally construed to affect its purpose. None of the powers granted to the corporation or to any subsidiary created pursuant to subdivision (5) of section 10a-204 under the provisions of this section shall be subject to the supervision or regulation or require the approval or consent of any municipality or political subdivision or any department, division, commission, board, body, bureau, official or agency thereof or of the state, and the exercise thereof shall not cause the corporation or any such subsidiary to be construed to be an agency within the scope of chapter 54 or a department, institution or agency of the state.\n\n(t) Notwithstanding the provisions of subsections (a) to (s), inclusive, of this section, any subsidiary created by a corporation pursuant to subdivision (5) of section 10a-204 may issue bonds, notes or other obligations to refund corporation bonds if approved by resolution of the subsidiary, and the corporation may issue bonds, notes or other obligations to refund subsidiary bonds, if approved by resolution of the corporation. No bond, note or other obligation issued by any such subsidiary shall constitute a debt or liability of the corporation, except as may be designated by resolution of the corporation, or of any other subsidiary created pursuant to subdivision (5) of section 10a-204 except as may be designated by resolution of such other subsidiary. No bond, note or other obligation of the corporation shall constitute a debt or liability of a subsidiary, except as may be designated by resolution of such subsidiary. Any subsidiary created for the purpose of financing student loans originated pursuant to Title IV, Part B of the Higher Education Act of 1965, as from time to time amended, through the issuance of bonds, notes or other obligations that bear interest that may be excludable from the gross income of the holder or holders of such bonds, notes or other obligations under the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, or any subsequent corresponding internal revenue code of the United States, as from time to time amended, shall be conclusively deemed to have been organized at the request of the state for purposes of Section 150(d)(2) of said Internal Revenue Code.\n\n(u) Notwithstanding the provisions of this section, no subsidiary created pursuant to subdivision (5) of section 10a-204 , other than a nonprofit subsidiary, shall be authorized to issue bonds, notes or other obligations pursuant to this section, provided this subsection shall not be deemed to preclude the incurrence of debt, other than through the public issuance of bonds, notes or obligations, by a for-profit subsidiary to provide sufficient funds for carrying out the provisions of subdivision (3) of section 10a-201 ."

The assets held in or credited to any special capital reserve fund established under this section, except as hereinafter provided, shall be used solely for the payment of the principal of notes and bonds of the authority secured by such capital reserve fund as the same become due, the purchase of such notes and bonds of the authority, the payment of interest on such notes and bonds of the authority or the payment of any redemption premium required to be paid when such bonds are redeemed prior to maturity or released by the authority; provided, the authority shall have power to require that moneys in any such fund shall not be withdrawn therefrom at any time in such amount as would reduce the amount of such funds to less than the maximum amount of principal and interest becoming due by reason of maturity or a required sinking fund installment in any succeeding calendar year on the bonds of the authority then outstanding and secured by such special capital reserve fund, or such lesser amount specified by the authority in its resolution authorizing the issuance of any such bonds, such amount being herein referred to as the “required minimum capital reserve”, except for the purpose of paying such principal of, redemption premium and interest on such bonds of the authority secured by such special capital reserve becoming due and for the payment of which other moneys of the authority are not available. The authority may provide that it shall not issue bonds at any time if the required minimum capital reserve on outstanding bonds secured by a special capital reserve fund and the bonds then to be issued and secured by a special capital reserve fund will exceed the amount of such special capital reserve fund at the time of issuance, unless the authority, at the time of the issuance of such bonds, shall deposit in such special capital reserve fund from the proceeds of the bonds so to be issued, or otherwise, an amount which, together with the amount then in such special capital reserve fund, will be not less than the required minimum capital reserve. The authority may, as part of the contract of the authority with the owners of such bonds, provide that on or before December first, annually, there is deemed to be appropriated from the state General Fund such sums, if any, as shall be certified by the chairman of the authority to the Secretary of the Office of Policy and Management and the Treasurer of the state, as necessary to restore each such special capital reserve fund to the amount equal to the required minimum capital reserve of such fund, and such amounts shall be allotted and paid to the authority. For the purpose of evaluation of any such special capital reserve fund, obligations acquired as an investment for any such fund shall be valued at amortized cost. Nothing contained in this section shall preclude the authority from establishing and creating other debt service reserve funds in connection with the issuance of bonds or notes of the authority. Subject to any agreement or agreements with owners of outstanding notes and bonds of the authority, any amount or amounts allotted and paid to the authority pursuant to this section shall be repaid to the state from moneys of the authority at such time as such moneys are not required for any other of its corporate purposes and in any event shall be repaid to the state on the date one year after all bonds and notes of the authority theretofore issued on the date or dates such amount or amounts are allotted and paid to the authority or thereafter issued, together with interest on such bonds and notes, with interest on any unpaid installments of interest and all costs and expenses in connection with any action or proceeding by or on behalf of the owners thereof, are fully met and discharged. Notwithstanding any other provisions contained in this chapter, the aggregate amount of bonds outstanding at any time secured by such special capital reserve funds authorized to be created and established by this section shall not exceed three hundred million dollars and no such bonds shall be issued to pay program costs unless the authority is of the opinion and determines that the revenues to be derived from the program shall be sufficient (i) to pay the principal of and interest on the bonds issued to finance the program, (ii) to establish, increase and maintain any reserves deemed by the authority to be advisable to secure the payment of the principal of and interest on such bonds, (iii) to pay the cost of maintaining and servicing the program and keeping it properly insured, and (iv) to pay such other costs of the program as may be required."
