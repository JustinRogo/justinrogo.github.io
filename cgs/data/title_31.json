If such a demand is made, the applicable arbitration procedure prescribed pursuant to the general statutes shall apply, except that the factors considered by the arbitrator shall be: (A) The ability of the exclusive representative to communicate with the public employees it represents, (B) the legal obligations of the exclusive representative to such public employees, (C) state, federal and local laws that are applicable to the employer and the employees, (D) stipulations of the parties, (E) the interests and welfare of the public and the financial condition and day-to-day operations of similarly situated public agencies, (F) the structure, time and manner of access of the exclusive representative to a new employee orientation for comparable public employers, including, but not limited to, access provisions in other memoranda of understanding or collective bargaining agreements containing such provisions, (G) the public employee organization's need to meaningfully communicate through cost-effective and efficient means with the public employees it represents, and (H) any other factors that are normally or traditionally taken into consideration in establishing the structure, time and manner of access of the exclusive representative to a new employee orientation.\n\n(c) A public employer shall provide the exclusive representative access to the public employees that such exclusive representative represents. Such access includes, but shall not be limited to: (1) The right to meet with individual employees on the premises of the public employer during the workday to investigate and discuss grievances, workplace-related complaints and other workplace issues, (2) the right to conduct worksite meetings during meal periods and during other paid or unpaid breaks, and before and after the workday, on the employer's premises, and (3) the right to meet with newly hired employees within the bargaining unit, without charge to the pay or leave time of the employees, for not less than thirty minutes nor more than one hundred twenty minutes, within thirty calendar days after the date of hire, during new employee orientations, or if the public employer does not conduct new employee orientation, at individual or group meetings.\n\n(d) In addition to any public employee organization's right to employee information pursuant to the laws of this state or any applicable collective bargaining agreement, beginning on January 1, 2022, every one hundred twenty calendar days, unless more frequent or more detailed lists are required by agreement between the parties, a public employer shall provide the exclusive representative, in an editable digital file format agreed to by the exclusive representative, the following information: Each bargaining unit employee's name, job title, worksite location, work telephone number, date of hire, work electronic mail address, home address and, if authorized by the employee via written authorization provided to the exclusive representative, the employee's home telephone number, personal cellular mobile telephone number and personal electronic mail address if on file with the public employer. Any written authorization required under this subsection may be revoked by the employee at any time and such authorization or revocation shall be provided to the exclusive representative at either the physical or electronic address provided by such representative pursuant to subdivision (1) of subsection (b) of this section.\n\n(e) The exclusive representative shall have the right to use the electronic mail systems of public employers to communicate with bargaining unit members regarding collective bargaining, the administration of collective bargaining agreements, the investigation of grievances, other workplace-related complaints and issues, and internal matters involving the governance or business of the public employee organization. The provisions of this subsection shall not limit the rights of a public employee organization to communicate with public employees.\n\n(f) Consistent with the provisions of subsection (c) of this section, the exclusive representative shall have the right to use state and municipal government buildings and other facilities that are owned or leased by public employers to conduct meetings with bargaining unit members. An exclusive representative shall have the right to hold such meetings at a reasonable time and place, provided the meetings do not interfere with the public employer's operations. An exclusive representative shall have the right to conduct such meetings without undue interference and may place reasonable restrictions on the conduct of an individual attending such meetings.\n\n(g) The requirements set forth in this section establish the minimum requirements for access to and communication with bargaining unit employees by the exclusive representative and shall not prevent a public employer from granting the exclusive representative greater access to or communication with public employees.\n\n(h) Employees, including retired employees, of a public employer may authorize deductions to be made from their salaries, wages or retirement allowances for the payment of dues to, or for any other service, program or committee provided or sponsored by, any public employee organization.\n\n(i) A public employer shall honor employee authorizations created or adopted by a public employee organization for the deductions described in subsection (h) of this section in any form that satisfies the requirements of sections 1-266 to 1-286 , inclusive, including, but not limited to, electronic and voice authorizations that meet the requirements of an electronic signature pursuant to said sections. The revocability of an authorization shall be determined by the terms of the authorization.\n\n(j) Public employers that provide for the administration of payroll deductions authorized by employees for public employee organizations shall: (1) Rely on a certification from any public employee organization requesting a deduction or reduction that such organization has and will maintain an authorization, signed by the individual from whose salary or wages the deduction or reduction is to be made. A public employee organization that certifies that it has and will maintain individual employee authorizations shall not be required to provide a copy of an individual authorization to the public employer unless a dispute arises about the existence or terms of the authorization. The public employee organization shall indemnify the public employer for any claims made by the employee for deductions made in reliance on that certification; and (2) direct employee requests to cancel or change deductions for public employee organizations to the employee organization, rather than to the public employer. The public employer shall rely on information provided by the public employee organization regarding whether deductions for the employee organization were properly canceled or changed, and the employee organization shall indemnify the public employer for any claims made by the employee for deductions made in reliance on such information. Deductions may be revoked only pursuant to the terms of an employee's written authorization.\n\n(k) A public employee organization or public employer shall only be liable for any amounts improperly deducted pursuant to this section. No further damages or penalties shall be awarded by any public agency or court.\n\n(l) Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, a public employer shall be liable to a public employee organization, without recourse to the employees, for the full amount of dues that such employer fails to remit to the public employee organization, provided the public employee organization has complied with the provisions of this section. The failure of an employer to comply with the provisions of this section shall be a violation of the duty to bargain and an unfair labor practice. The provisions of a collective bargaining agreement that contain the obligations set forth in this section may be enforced in accordance with the provisions of this section.\n\n(m) If a dispute arises between the employee and the public employee organization regarding the existence, validity or revocation of a payroll deduction authorization, the dispute shall be resolved through a proceeding pursuant to sections 5-274 , 7-471 and 10-153e , as applicable, to resolve a question of a prohibited practice.\n\n(n) A public employer shall not deter or discourage public employees or applicants for public employee positions from becoming or remaining members of a public employee organization, or from authorizing representation by a public employee organization, or from authorizing dues or deductions to a public employee organization.\n\n(o) It shall be a prohibited practice for a public employer to: (1) Encourage an employee to resign or decline to obtain membership in a public employee organization, (2) encourage an employee to revoke authorization for a payroll deduction of dues to a public employee organization, (3) knowingly aid any such effort by any other entity, or (4) permit use of the employer's electronic mail system by any entity to discourage membership in a public employee organization or discourage authorization of payroll deduction of dues to a public employee organization."

            "text": "(a) There is established a Paid Family and Medical Leave Insurance Authority which shall be a body politic and corporate and shall constitute a public instrumentality and political subdivision of the state created for the performance of an essential public and governmental function. The authority shall not be construed to be a department, institution or agency of the state.\n\n(b) The powers of the authority shall be vested in and exercised by a board of directors, which shall consist of thirteen voting members, as follows: (1) The Labor Commissioner, or his or her designee, who shall serve as an ex-officio voting member; (2) the Secretary of the Office of Policy and Management, or his or her designee, who shall serve as an ex-officio voting member; (3) the Commissioner of Administrative Services, or his or her designee, who shall serve as an ex-officio voting member; (4) the Commissioner of Economic and Community Development, or his or her designee, who shall serve as an ex-officio voting member; (5) one appointed by the speaker of the House of Representatives, who shall have skill, knowledge and experience in the interests of employees; (6) one appointed by the majority leader of the House of Representatives, who shall be an attorney advocating for the rights, benefits and opportunities of employees; (7) one appointed by the minority leader of the House of Representatives, who shall have skill, knowledge and experience in the interests of disability insurance plans; (8) one appointed by the president pro tempore of the Senate, who shall be an impacted individual who has personal knowledge and experience with economically distressed and underserved communities and is reflective of the ethnic and economic diversity of such communities; (9) one appointed by the majority leader of the Senate, who shall have skill, knowledge and experience in the interests of small business employees; (10) one appointed by the minority leader of the Senate, who shall have skill, knowledge and experience in the interests of employees of large businesses; and (11) three appointed by the Governor, one of whom shall have skill, knowledge and experience in modern software practices, and two of whom shall have skill, knowledge and experience in family and medical leave programs. The State Treasurer, or his or her designee, and the State Comptroller, or his or her designee, shall serve as ex-officio nonvoting members. Each member appointed pursuant to subdivisions (5) to (11), inclusive, of this subsection shall serve an initial term of four years. Thereafter, said members of the General Assembly and the Governor shall appoint members of the board to succeed such appointees whose terms have expired and each member so appointed shall hold office for a term of three years from July first in the year of his or her appointment. Members shall hold office until a successor member has been duly appointed. Any member who fails to attend three consecutive meetings or who fails to attend fifty per cent of all meetings held during any calendar year shall be deemed to have resigned from the board.\n\n(c) All initial appointments to the board shall be made not later than July 1, 2019. Any vacancy shall be filled by the appointing authority not later than thirty calendar days after the office becomes vacant. Any member previously appointed to the board may be reappointed.\n\n(d) The Governor shall select a chairperson of the board from among the members of the board. The board shall annually elect a vice-chairperson and such other officers as it deems necessary from among its members.

The executive director shall be an employee of the authority and shall receive such compensation as prescribed by the board.\n\n(e) (1) On and after January 1, 2022, the employees of the authority shall be considered state employees for the purposes of sections 5-270 to 5-280 , inclusive.

Managerial employees and other employees not covered by a collective bargaining agreement shall be exempt from the classified service. With regard to unclassified positions, the authority shall not be required to comply with personnel policies and procedures of the Department of Administrative Services and the Office of Policy and Management with regard to approval for the creation of new positions, the number of such positions, the decision to fill such positions or the time for filling such positions. The authority, not the executive branch, shall have the power to determine whether an individual is qualified to fill an unclassified position at the authority. The authority shall determine the qualifications and set the terms and conditions of employment of employees not covered by a collective bargaining agreement, including the establishment of compensation and incentive plans, subject to such bargaining obligation as may be created if any such employees elect an exclusive bargaining agent pursuant to the provisions of sections 5-270 to 5-280 , inclusive.\n\n(2) The executive branch shall be authorized and empowered to negotiate on behalf of the authority with employees of the authority covered by collective bargaining and represent the authority in all other collective bargaining matters.

The oath shall be filed in the office of the Secretary of the State.\n\n(2) Each officer or member of the board authorized by resolution of the board to handle funds or sign checks for the program shall, not later than ten calendar days after the date the board adopts such authorizing resolution, execute a surety bond in the penal sum of fifty thousand dollars or procure an equivalent insurance product or, in lieu thereof, the chairperson shall obtain a blanket position bond covering the executive director and each member of the board and other employee or authorized officer of the authority in the penal sum of fifty thousand dollars. Each such bond or equivalent insurance product shall be (A) conditioned upon the faithful performance of the duties of the chairperson or the members, executive director and other authorized officers or employees, as the case may be, and (B) issued by an insurance company authorized to transact business in this state as surety. The cost of each such bond shall be paid by the authority.\n\n(i) An authorized officer or the executive director, if one is appointed by the board pursuant to subsection (d) of this section, shall supervise the administrative affairs and technical activities of the program in accordance with the directives of the board. Such authorized officer or executive director, as the case may be, shall keep a record of the proceedings of the program and shall be custodian of all books, documents and papers filed with the program, the minute book or journal of the program and its official seal. Such authorized officer or executive director, as the case may be, may cause copies to be made of all minutes and other records and documents of the program and may give certificates under the official seal of the program to the effect that such copies are true copies, and all persons dealing with the program may rely upon such certificates.\n\n(j) A majority of the voting members of the board shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of any business or the exercise of any power of the authority. Except as specified in section 1-121 and subdivision (14) of subsection (b) of section 31-49h , the affirmative vote of a majority of voting members present at a meeting of the board shall be sufficient for action taken by the board.\n\n(k) (1) No member of the board or any officer, agent or employee of the authority shall, directly or indirectly, have any financial interest in any corporation, business trust, estate, trust, partnership or association, two or more persons having a joint or common interest, or any other legal or commercial entity contracting with the authority. As used in this section, “financial interest” does not include an interest of a de minimis nature or an interest that is not distinct from that of a substantial segment of the general public.\n\n(2) Notwithstanding the provisions of subdivision (1) of this subsection or any other section of the general statutes, it shall not be a conflict of interest or a violation of the provisions of said subdivision or any other section of the general statutes for a trustee, director, officer or employee of a bank, insurance company, investment advisor, investment company or investment banking firm, to serve as a member of the board, provided, in each case to which the provisions of this subdivision are applicable, such trustee, director, officer or employee of such a firm abstains from discussion, deliberation, action and vote by the board in specific respect to any undertaking pursuant to sections 31-49f to 31-49t , inclusive, in which such firm has a direct interest separate from the interests of all similar firms generally.\n\n(l) The authority shall continue as long as the program remains in effect and until its existence is terminated by law. Upon termination of the existence of the authority, all its rights and properties shall pass to and be vested in the state of Connecticut.\n\n(m) The provisions of this section and section 1-125 shall apply to any member, director or employee of the authority. No person shall be subject to civil liability for the debts, obligations or liabilities of the authority as provided in this section and section 1-125 ."

Whether subject matter addressed by a particular statement is of public concern involves a question of law for the court, and whether the statement addresses such a matter depends on its content, form and context which is a question of fact, and in this case, it was within court's discretion to submit the question to the jury; in an action under section, it is within province of trial court to determine as a matter of law which topics are considered to be of public concern, but whether employee's statements address such a topic is within the province of the jury to be determined by looking at content, form and context; jury instruction was permissible that for protection to apply, employee's statement must concern a broader issue of public concern and not merely employee's personal matters. 249 C. 766. Section extends protection of rights of free speech under federal and state constitutions to employees in a private workplace; managerial decision about placement of flags in the workplace does not involve employee's constitutional rights of free speech. 251 C. 1. Public employees who make statements pursuant to their official duties are not speaking as citizens for first amendment purposes under federal constitution and plaintiff failed to establish she was speaking in unofficial capacity. 304 C. 483. While constitutional protections grounded in first amendment of federal constitution are applicable to private employees, plaintiff's speech not protected under federal constitution because statements were made pursuant to his employment duties. Id., 585. Rule in 547 U.S. 410 (i.e., when public employees make statements pursuant to their official duties, the employees are not speaking as citizens for first amendment purposes, and the federal constitution does not insulate their communications from employer discipline) does not apply to claim that employer violated section by subjecting employee to discipline or discharge on account of the exercise by such employee of rights guaranteed by Art. I, Sec. 3, 4 or 14 of the state constitution; section extends same protection to employee speech pursuant to official job duties in a private workplace as the protection afforded to employee speech in a public workplace for claims involving the state constitution. 319 C. 175."

The commissioner shall make such list available to the public and shall prominently display a link to such list on the Labor Department's Internet web site.\n\n(e) Except as provided in subsection (g) of this section and notwithstanding any other provision of the general statutes, a call center employer on the annual list compiled under subsection (d) of this section shall be ineligible for any direct or indirect state grants, state guaranteed loans, state tax benefits or other state financial support for a period of five years from the date such list is published.\n\n(f) Except as provided in subsection (g) of this section and notwithstanding any other provision of the general statutes, a call center employer on the annual list compiled under subsection (d) of this section shall remit the unamortized value of any state grant, guaranteed loan, state tax benefit or other state financial support such call center employer has received in the five-year period prior to the date such call center was placed on such list. Nothing in this section shall be deemed to prevent an employer from receiving any grant to provide training or other employment assistance to individuals who are selected as being in particular need of training or other employment assistance due to the transfer or relocation of the employer's call center, facility or operating units.\n\n(g) The commissioner, in consultation with the appropriate agency providing a loan or grant, may waive the ineligibility for state financial support under subsection (e) of this section and the remittance requirement under subsection (f) of this section if the employer demonstrates that such ineligibility and requirement would: (1) Threaten state or national security, (2) result in substantial job loss in this state, or (3) harm the environment.\n\n(h) The department head of each state agency shall ensure that for all new contracts or new agreements entered into on and after October 1, 2021, all state business-related call center and customer service work is performed by state contractors or other agents or subcontractors entirely within this state, except that, if any such contractor, other agent or subcontractor performs work outside this state and adds customer service employees who will perform work pursuant to such new contracts or agreements, such new employees shall immediately be employed within this state. Businesses subject to a contract or agreement agreed to prior to October 1, 2021, with terms extending beyond October 1, 2023, shall be subject to the provisions of this subsection if the contract or agreement is renewed.\n\n(i) No provision of this section shall be construed to permit withholding or denial of payments, compensation or benefits under any other provision of the general statutes, including, but not limited to, state unemployment compensation, disability payments or worker retraining or readjustment funds, to workers employed by employers that relocate from this state to a foreign country.\n\n(j) Nothing in this section shall be construed as creating a private cause of action against an employer who has violated, or is alleged to have violated, any provision of this section."

Legislature did not exempt real estate salespersons from section as was done in Unemployment and Workers' Compensation Acts. 231 C. 690. Award of double damages justified where employer requested employee to work additional hours, assured employee that she would be paid and then subsequently denied payment of overtime wages; determination of whether an individual can be considered an employer where a corporate entity exists depends on the individual's authority to control hours and wages and responsibility for illegally withholding wages. 243 C. 454. Analysis of legislative history; wage statutes, as a whole, do not provide substantive rights regarding how a wage is earned, but provide remedial protections where employer-employee wage agreement is violated. 260 C. 152. It is well established that it is appropriate for plaintiff to recover attorney's fees and double damages under section only when defendant has acted with bad faith, arbitrariness or unreasonableness; if a contingency fee agreement is reasonable, trial court may depart from its terms only when necessary to prevent substantial unfairness to the party who bears ultimate responsibility for payment of the fee. 265 C. 210. Double damage award under section not equivalent to punitive or exemplary damages; provision prohibiting employer from raising agreement for payment of wages between employer and employee as defense against action for unpaid wages does not bar employer from raising agreement for other purposes, such as ground for vacating arbitration award. 275 C. 72. Definitions in Sec. 31-71a apply when construing section. 293 C. 515. Contract provision providing that commissions will be paid only if the work had been invoiced prior to termination of the employee does not violate statutorily based public policy and is enforceable; an employee cannot use the nonpayment of wages that have not accrued as the basis for a wrongful discharge claim. 322 C. 385."

An employer who discontinues his business and enters the armed forces of the United States shall cease immediately to be subject to this chapter.",

An employer not previously subject to this chapter shall become subject to this chapter as follows: (1) An employer subject to the Federal Unemployment Tax Act for any year shall be subject to the provisions of this chapter from the beginning of such year if he had one or more employees in his employment in the state of Connecticut in such year; (2) an employer who acquires substantially all of the assets, organization, trade or business of another employer who at the time of such acquisition was subject to this chapter shall immediately become subject to this chapter as a successor employer; (3) an employer who, after December 31, 1973, (A) in any calendar quarter in either the current or preceding calendar year paid wages for services in employment of one thousand five hundred dollars or more, or (B) for some portion of a day in each of twenty different calendar weeks, whether or not such weeks were consecutive, in either the current or the preceding calendar year, had in employment at least one individual irrespective of whether the same individual was in employment in each such day; (4) an employer for which service in employment as defined in subdivision (1) (C) of subsection (a) of section 31-222 is performed after December 31, 1971; (5) an employer for which service in employment as defined in subdivision (1) (D) of said subsection (a) is performed after December 31, 1971; (6) an employer which, together with one or more other employers, is owned or controlled, by legally enforceable means or otherwise, directly or indirectly by the same interests, or which owns or controls, by legally enforceable means or otherwise, one or more other employers, and which, if treated as a single unit or entity with such other employers or interests, or both, would be an employer under subdivision (3) of this subsection and subparagraphs (H) and (J) of subdivision (1) of subsection (a) of section 31-222 ; (7) any employer, not defined as such by any other subdivision of this subsection, (A) for which, within either the current or preceding calendar year, service is or was performed with respect to which such employer is liable for any federal tax against which credit may be taken for contributions required to be paid into a state unemployment fund, or (B) which, as a condition for approval of this chapter for full tax credit against the tax imposed by the federal Unemployment Tax Act, is required, pursuant to such federal act, to be an “employer” under this chapter; (8) an employer which, having become an employer under any of subdivisions (1) to (7), inclusive, of this subsection, has not, under subsection (c) ceased to be an employer subject to this chapter; (9) for the effective period of its election pursuant to subsection (b), an employer which has elected to become subject to this chapter. In determining whether an employer in question shall be considered, for the purposes of this section, as having had a particular number of employees in his employment at a given time, there shall be counted, in addition to his own employees, if any, (A) the employees of each employer whose business was at the given time owned or controlled, directly or indirectly, by the same interests which owned or controlled the business of the employer in question, and (B) the employees of each employer, substantially all of whose assets, organization, trade or business has, after the given time during the same calendar year, been acquired by the employer in question. If an employer shall contract with or shall have under him any contractor or subcontractor for any work which is part of said employer's usual trade, occupation, profession or business, and which is performed in, on or about the premises under such employer's control, and if such contractor or subcontractor shall not be subject to this chapter, such employer shall, for all the purposes of this chapter, be deemed to employ each individual in the employ of such contractor or subcontractor for each day during which such individual is engaged solely in performing such work; but this provision shall not prevent such employer from recovering from such contractor or subcontractor the amount of any contributions he may be required by this chapter to pay with respect to wages of such individuals for such work.\n\n(b) Voluntary liability. Any employer not so subject to this chapter may accept the provisions of this chapter and become in all respects subject thereto by agreeing in writing filed with the administrator to pay the contributions required from employers subject to this chapter. Any employer with persons in his employ engaged in one or more of the types of service specified in subdivision (5) of subsection (a) of section 31-222 , except the service described by subparagraph (A) thereof, may elect that the provisions of this chapter apply to such services by agreeing in writing filed with the administrator to pay the contributions on wages for such services. Any employer defined in subdivision (1) (D) or (E) of subsection (a) of section 31-222 or (5) (F) or (L) of said section may elect either to pay the contributions on wages for services or to finance benefits on a reimbursable basis, by paying into the Unemployment Compensation Fund an amount equivalent to the amount of benefits paid out to claimants who during the applicable period were paid wages by the employer concerned, said election to be made in writing to the administrator in accordance with the provisions of subsection (g) of section 31-225 . Any employer may revoke acceptance of voluntary liability at the end of any calendar year following the calendar year in which he made such acceptance if he gives written notice to the administrator, accompanied by proof satisfactory to the administrator that he has paid all contributions due under the provisions of this chapter and that he has notified his employees of his intention to revoke such acceptance; such application to revoke acceptance shall be submitted within thirty days after the end of a calendar year and the administrator shall render his decision on such application within sixty days after submission thereof and such revocation of acceptance shall be effective on the thirty-first day of December next preceding the giving of written notice from the administrator to the employer that he is satisfied with such proofs.\n\n(c) Release from liability. An employer may cease to be subject to this chapter at the end of any calendar year following the calendar year in which he became subject to this chapter if he gives written notice to the administrator, accompanied by proof satisfactory to the administrator that he has not employed one employee for at least thirteen weeks during the next-preceding fifteen months, that he is not subject to the Federal Unemployment Tax Act, and that he has notified his employees of his intention to cease to be subject to this chapter; such application for release shall be submitted within thirty days after the end of a calendar year and the administrator shall render his decision on such application within sixty days after submission thereof and the employer shall cease to be subject to this chapter on the thirty-first day of December next preceding the giving of written notice from the administrator to the employer that he is satisfied with such proofs. The administrator shall waive the requirement for an application for release whenever it shall appear that the employer was unable to comply with such requirement for the reason that, at the time when he had qualified for release from liability under the provisions of this chapter, he was in good faith not aware of the fact that he was subject to the provisions of this chapter. An employer who discontinues his business and enters the armed forces of the United States shall cease immediately to be subject to this chapter.\n\n(d) Employment to include out-of-state service. For the purposes of subdivisions (5) and (7) of subsection (a) of this section, employment shall include service which would constitute employment but for the fact that such service is deemed to be performed entirely within another state pursuant to an election under an arrangement entered into with such state by the administrator and an agency charged with the administration of any other state or federal unemployment compensation law.\n\n(e) Calendar week when December 31 and January 1 in same week. For the purposes of subdivisions (3)(B) and (5) of subsection (a) of this section, in respect to any week including both December thirty-first and January first, the days of that week to and including December thirty-first shall be deemed one calendar week, and the days beginning and including January first another such week.\n\n(f) Employer not previously subject to chapter. Notification to administrator. Any employer not previously subject to this chapter, that becomes subject to this chapter pursuant to subsection (a) or (b) of this section, shall provide electronic notice of the same to the administrator, in a manner prescribed by the administrator, not later than thirty days after becoming subject to this chapter.\n\n(g) Employer acquisitions. Notification to administrator. Any employer acquiring substantially all of the assets, organization, trade or business of another employer subject to this chapter shall provide electronic notice of such acquisition to the administrator, in a manner prescribed by the administrator, not later than thirty days after such acquisition. For purposes of this subsection, trade or business includes an employer's employees.\n\n(h) Civil penalty. Any employer that fails to provide electronic notice as required by subsections (f) and (g) of this section shall be liable to the administrator for a civil penalty of fifty dollars for each violation."

              "(1) Any nonprofit organization which, pursuant to subdivision (1) (D) of subsection (a) of section 31-222 is, or becomes, subject to this chapter on or after January 1, 1971, shall pay contributions under the provisions of subsection (a) of this section, unless it elects, in accordance with this subparagraph, to pay to the administrator for the unemployment fund an amount equal to the amount of regular and additional benefits and of one-half of the extended benefits paid, that is attributable to service in the employ of such nonprofit organization. (A) Any nonprofit organization which is, or becomes, subject to this chapter on January 1, 1971, may elect to become liable for payments in lieu of contributions for a period of not less than one taxable year beginning with January 1, 1971, provided it shall file with the administrator a written notice of its election within the thirty-day period immediately following July 1, 1971. (B) Any nonprofit organization which becomes subject to this chapter after January 1, 1971, may elect to become liable for payments in lieu of contributions for a period of not less than twelve months beginning with the date on which it so becomes subject by filing a written notice of its election with the administrator not later than thirty days immediately following the date of the determination that it is so subject. (C) Any nonprofit organization which makes an election in accordance with subparagraph (A) or subparagraph (B) of this subdivision shall continue to be liable for payments in lieu of contributions until it files with the administrator a written notice terminating its election not later than thirty days prior to the beginning of the taxable year for which such termination shall first be effective, provided liability for payments in lieu of contributions shall continue for any benefits attributable to service in the employ of such organization while it was electing payments in lieu of contributions. For purposes of benefit ratio and for billing purposes, an organization which terminates its election of payments in lieu of contributions shall be treated as two separate employers. (D) Any nonprofit organization which has been paying contributions under this chapter for a period subsequent to January 1, 1971, may change to a reimbursable basis by filing with the administrator not later than thirty days prior to the beginning of any taxable year a written notice of election to become liable for payments in lieu of contributions. Such election shall not be terminable by the organization for that and the next year. (E) The administrator may for good cause extend the period within which a notice of election, or a notice of termination, must be filed and may permit an election to be retroactive but not any earlier than with respect to benefits paid after December 31, 1970. (F) The administrator, in accordance with such regulations as the administrator may prescribe, shall notify each nonprofit organization of any determination which the administrator may make of its status as an employer and of the effective date of any election which it makes and of any termination of such election. Such determinations shall be subject to reconsideration, appeal and review in accordance with the provisions of this chapter applicable to determination, appeal and review.",
              "(2) Payments in lieu of contributions shall be made in accordance with the following provisions: (A) At the end of each calendar quarter, or at the end of any other period as determined by the administrator, the administrator shall bill each nonprofit organization or group of such organizations which has elected to make payments in lieu of contributions for an amount equal to the full amount of regular and additional benefits plus one-half of the amount of extended benefits paid during such quarter or other prescribed period that is attributable to service in the employ of such organization. (B) Payment of any bill rendered under this subsection shall be made not later than thirty days after such bill was mailed to the last-known address of the nonprofit organization or was otherwise delivered to it, unless there has been an application for review and redetermination in accordance with subparagraph (D) of this subdivision. (C) Payments made by any nonprofit organization under the provisions of this subsection shall not be deducted or deductible, in whole or in part, from the remuneration of individuals in the employ of the organization. (D) The amount due specified in any bill from the administrator shall be conclusive on the organization unless, within the time prescribed in section 31-241 after the bill was mailed to its last-known address or otherwise delivered to it, the organization files an application for redetermination by the administrator or an appeal in the manner provided in sections 31-241 and 31-242 setting forth the grounds for such application or appeal. The administrator or referee, as the case may be, shall promptly review and reconsider the amount due specified in the bill and shall thereafter issue a redetermination or decision, as applicable in any case in which such application for redetermination or appeal has been filed. Any redetermination by the administrator shall be conclusive on the organization unless, within the time prescribed in section 31-241 after the redetermination was mailed to its last-known address or otherwise delivered to it, the organization files an appeal in the manner prescribed in sections 31-241 and 31-242 , setting forth the grounds for the appeal. The decision of the referee shall become final on the twenty-second day after the date of its rendition unless the party aggrieved thereby, including the administrator, files an appeal in the manner provided in section 31-249 , setting forth the grounds for the appeal. Redeterminations by the administrator shall be governed by the provisions of section 31-243 . Proceedings on appeal to the unemployment compensation referee from the amount of a bill rendered under this subsection or a redetermination of such amount shall be in accordance with the provisions of section 31-242 and the decision of the referee shall be subject to the provisions of sections 31-248 and 31-249 . (E) Past due payments of amounts in lieu of contributions shall be subject to the same interest that, pursuant to section 31-265 applies to past due contributions; an employer electing reimbursement is subject to the same penalties provided under this chapter as employers paying contributions.",
              "(3) If the administrator at any time deems it necessary because of the financial condition of the organization, any nonprofit organization that elects to become liable for payments in lieu of contributions shall be required, within thirty days, to execute and file with the administrator a surety bond approved by the administrator or it may elect instead to deposit with the administrator cash or securities. The amount of such bond or deposit shall be determined in accordance with the provisions of this subdivision. (A) The amount of the bond or deposit required by this subdivision shall be determined by the administrator but shall not exceed a percentage of the organization's annual taxable payroll equal to the maximum rate that any employer liable for contributions during the year involved would have to pay for employment as defined in subsection (b) of section 31-222 for the four calendar quarters immediately preceding the effective date of the election, the renewal date in the case of a bond, or the biennial anniversary of the effective date of election in the case of a deposit of cash or securities, whichever date shall be most recent and applicable. If the nonprofit organization did not pay wages in each of such four calendar quarters, the amount of the bond or deposit shall be as determined by the administrator. The term “cash” includes certified or bank checks or other guaranteed instruments. (B) Any bond deposited under this subdivision shall be in force for a period of not less than two taxable years and shall be renewed with the approval of the administrator, at such times as the administrator may prescribe, but not less frequently than at two-year intervals as long as the organization continues to be liable for payments in lieu of contributions. The administrator shall require adjustments to be made in a previously filed bond as the administrator deems appropriate. If the bond is to be increased, the adjusted bond shall be filed by the organization within thirty days of the date notice of the required adjustment was mailed or otherwise delivered to it. Failure by any organization covered by such bond to pay the full amount of payments in lieu of contributions when due, together with any applicable interest and penalties provided for in subdivision (2) (E) of this subsection, shall render the surety liable on such bond to the extent of the bond, as though the surety was such organization. (C) Any deposit of cash or securities in accordance with this subdivision shall be retained by the administrator in an escrow account until liability under the election is terminated, at which time it shall be returned to the organization, less any deductions as hereinafter provided. The administrator may deduct from the cash deposited under this subdivision by a nonprofit organization or sell the securities it has so deposited to the extent necessary to satisfy any due and unpaid payments in lieu of contributions and any applicable interest and penalties provided for in subdivision (2) (E) of this subsection. The administrator shall require the organization within thirty days following any deduction from a cash deposit or sale of deposited securities under the provisions of this subparagraph to deposit sufficient additional cash or securities to make whole the organization's deposit at the prior level. Any cash remaining from the sale of such securities shall be a part of the organization's escrow account. The administrator may, at any time, review the adequacy of the deposit made by any organization. If, as a result of such review, the administrator determines that an adjustment is necessary, said administrator shall require the organization to make additional deposit within thirty days of written notice of determination or shall return to it such portion of the deposit as the administrator no longer considers necessary, whichever action is appropriate. Disposition of income from securities held in escrow shall be governed by any applicable provision of state law. (D) If any nonprofit organization fails to file a bond or make a deposit, or to file a bond in an increased amount or to increase or make whole the amount of a previously made deposit, as provided under this subdivision, the administrator may terminate such organization's election to make payments in lieu of contributions and such termination shall continue for not less than the four-consecutive-calendar-quarter period beginning with the quarter in which such termination becomes effective; provided the administrator may extend for good cause the applicable filing, deposit or adjustment period by not more than fifteen days.",
              "(4) If any nonprofit organization is delinquent in making payments in lieu of contributions as required under subdivision (2) of this subsection, and a bond or security as provided in subdivision (3) of this subsection has not been required, or required and not filed within thirty days, the administrator may terminate such organization's election to make payments in lieu of contributions as of the beginning of the next taxable year, and such termination shall be effective for that and the next taxable year.",
              "(5) Each employer that is liable for payments in lieu of contributions shall pay to the administrator for the fund the amount of regular and additional benefits plus the amount of one-half of extended benefits paid that are attributable to service in the employ of such employer. If benefits paid to an individual are based on wages paid by more than one employer and one or more of such employers are liable for payments in lieu of contributions, the amount payable to the fund by each employer that is liable for such payments, shall be an amount which bears the same ratio to the total benefits paid to the individual as the total base period wages paid to the individual by such employer bear to the total base period wages paid to the individual by all of the individual's base period employers.",
              "(6) Any two or more employers that have become liable for payments in lieu of contributions may file a joint application to the administrator for the establishment of a group account for the purpose of sharing the cost of benefits paid that are attributable to service in the employ of such employers. Each such application shall identify and authorize a group representative to act as the group's agent for the purposes of this subdivision. Upon the administrator's approval of the application, the administrator shall establish a group account for such employers effective as of the beginning of the calendar quarter in which the administrator receives the application and shall notify the group's representative of the effective date of the account. Such account shall remain in effect for not less than one year and thereafter until terminated at the discretion of the administrator or upon application by the group. Upon establishment of the account, each member of the group shall be liable for payments in lieu of contributions with respect to each calendar quarter in the amount that bears the same ratio to the total benefits paid in such quarter that are attributable to service performed in the employ of all members of the group as the total wages paid for service in employment by such member in such quarter bear to the total wages paid during such quarter for service performed in the employ of all members of the group. The administrator shall prescribe such regulations as he or she deems necessary with respect to applications for establishment, maintenance and termination of group accounts that are authorized by this subdivision, for addition of new members to, and withdrawal of active members from, such accounts, and for the determination of the amounts that are payable under this subdivision by members of the group and the time and manner of such payments.",
              "(h) Subsections (a) to (g), inclusive, of this section shall first apply to benefits charged with respect to benefits paid in benefit years starting on or after June 30, 1975.",
              "(i) Notwithstanding any other provision of the general statutes to the contrary, any employer, individual, organization, partnership, corporation or other legal entity which engages, in any manner, in contract construction activity in this state and which has its base of operations and is incorporated in another state, shall furnish to the administrator before beginning any such construction activity, a bond, with a surety or sureties satisfactory to the administrator, in an amount to be determined by the administrator. The administrator shall adopt regulations, in accordance with the provisions of chapter 54, establishing the method for computation of such bond amounts. The use of such bonds shall be limited to payment for any unpaid unemployment compensation contributions, interest and penalties due from such contractor and attributable to such contracted work."

For the purpose of this subsection, a nonprofit organization is an organization or group of organizations described in Section 501(c)(3) of the Federal Internal Revenue Code which is exempt from income tax under Section 501(a) of said code.\n\n(1) Any nonprofit organization which, pursuant to subdivision (1) (D) of subsection (a) of section 31-222 is, or becomes, subject to this chapter on or after January 1, 1971, shall pay contributions under the provisions of subsection (a) of this section, unless it elects, in accordance with this subparagraph, to pay to the administrator for the unemployment fund an amount equal to the amount of regular and additional benefits and of one-half of the extended benefits paid, that is attributable to service in the employ of such nonprofit organization. (A) Any nonprofit organization which is, or becomes, subject to this chapter on January 1, 1971, may elect to become liable for payments in lieu of contributions for a period of not less than one taxable year beginning with January 1, 1971, provided it shall file with the administrator a written notice of its election within the thirty-day period immediately following July 1, 1971. (B) Any nonprofit organization which becomes subject to this chapter after January 1, 1971, may elect to become liable for payments in lieu of contributions for a period of not less than twelve months beginning with the date on which it so becomes subject by filing a written notice of its election with the administrator not later than thirty days immediately following the date of the determination that it is so subject. (C) Any nonprofit organization which makes an election in accordance with subparagraph (A) or subparagraph (B) of this subdivision shall continue to be liable for payments in lieu of contributions until it files with the administrator a written notice terminating its election not later than thirty days prior to the beginning of the taxable year for which such termination shall first be effective, provided liability for payments in lieu of contributions shall continue for any benefits attributable to service in the employ of such organization while it was electing payments in lieu of contributions. For purposes of benefit ratio and for billing purposes, an organization which terminates its election of payments in lieu of contributions shall be treated as two separate employers. (D) Any nonprofit organization which has been paying contributions under this chapter for a period subsequent to January 1, 1971, may change to a reimbursable basis by filing with the administrator not later than thirty days prior to the beginning of any taxable year a written notice of election to become liable for payments in lieu of contributions. Such election shall not be terminable by the organization for that and the next year. (E) The administrator may for good cause extend the period within which a notice of election, or a notice of termination, must be filed and may permit an election to be retroactive but not any earlier than with respect to benefits paid after December 31, 1970. (F) The administrator, in accordance with such regulations as the administrator may prescribe, shall notify each nonprofit organization of any determination which the administrator may make of its status as an employer and of the effective date of any election which it makes and of any termination of such election. Such determinations shall be subject to reconsideration, appeal and review in accordance with the provisions of this chapter applicable to determination, appeal and review.\n\n(2) Payments in lieu of contributions shall be made in accordance with the following provisions: (A) At the end of each calendar quarter, or at the end of any other period as determined by the administrator, the administrator shall bill each nonprofit organization or group of such organizations which has elected to make payments in lieu of contributions for an amount equal to the full amount of regular and additional benefits plus one-half of the amount of extended benefits paid during such quarter or other prescribed period that is attributable to service in the employ of such organization. (B) Payment of any bill rendered under this subsection shall be made not later than thirty days after such bill was mailed to the last-known address of the nonprofit organization or was otherwise delivered to it, unless there has been an application for review and redetermination in accordance with subparagraph (D) of this subdivision. (C) Payments made by any nonprofit organization under the provisions of this subsection shall not be deducted or deductible, in whole or in part, from the remuneration of individuals in the employ of the organization. (D) The amount due specified in any bill from the administrator shall be conclusive on the organization unless, within the time prescribed in section 31-241 after the bill was mailed to its last-known address or otherwise delivered to it, the organization files an application for redetermination by the administrator or an appeal in the manner provided in sections 31-241 and 31-242 setting forth the grounds for such application or appeal. The administrator or referee, as the case may be, shall promptly review and reconsider the amount due specified in the bill and shall thereafter issue a redetermination or decision, as applicable in any case in which such application for redetermination or appeal has been filed. Any redetermination by the administrator shall be conclusive on the organization unless, within the time prescribed in section 31-241 after the redetermination was mailed to its last-known address or otherwise delivered to it, the organization files an appeal in the manner prescribed in sections 31-241 and 31-242 , setting forth the grounds for the appeal. The decision of the referee shall become final on the twenty-second day after the date of its rendition unless the party aggrieved thereby, including the administrator, files an appeal in the manner provided in section 31-249 , setting forth the grounds for the appeal. Redeterminations by the administrator shall be governed by the provisions of section 31-243 . Proceedings on appeal to the unemployment compensation referee from the amount of a bill rendered under this subsection or a redetermination of such amount shall be in accordance with the provisions of section 31-242 and the decision of the referee shall be subject to the provisions of sections 31-248 and 31-249 . (E) Past due payments of amounts in lieu of contributions shall be subject to the same interest that, pursuant to section 31-265 applies to past due contributions; an employer electing reimbursement is subject to the same penalties provided under this chapter as employers paying contributions.\n\n(3) If the administrator at any time deems it necessary because of the financial condition of the organization, any nonprofit organization that elects to become liable for payments in lieu of contributions shall be required, within thirty days, to execute and file with the administrator a surety bond approved by the administrator or it may elect instead to deposit with the administrator cash or securities. The amount of such bond or deposit shall be determined in accordance with the provisions of this subdivision. (A) The amount of the bond or deposit required by this subdivision shall be determined by the administrator but shall not exceed a percentage of the organization's annual taxable payroll equal to the maximum rate that any employer liable for contributions during the year involved would have to pay for employment as defined in subsection (b) of section 31-222 for the four calendar quarters immediately preceding the effective date of the election, the renewal date in the case of a bond, or the biennial anniversary of the effective date of election in the case of a deposit of cash or securities, whichever date shall be most recent and applicable. If the nonprofit organization did not pay wages in each of such four calendar quarters, the amount of the bond or deposit shall be as determined by the administrator. The term “cash” includes certified or bank checks or other guaranteed instruments. (B) Any bond deposited under this subdivision shall be in force for a period of not less than two taxable years and shall be renewed with the approval of the administrator, at such times as the administrator may prescribe, but not less frequently than at two-year intervals as long as the organization continues to be liable for payments in lieu of contributions. The administrator shall require adjustments to be made in a previously filed bond as the administrator deems appropriate. If the bond is to be increased, the adjusted bond shall be filed by the organization within thirty days of the date notice of the required adjustment was mailed or otherwise delivered to it. Failure by any organization covered by such bond to pay the full amount of payments in lieu of contributions when due, together with any applicable interest and penalties provided for in subdivision (2) (E) of this subsection, shall render the surety liable on such bond to the extent of the bond, as though the surety was such organization. (C) Any deposit of cash or securities in accordance with this subdivision shall be retained by the administrator in an escrow account until liability under the election is terminated, at which time it shall be returned to the organization, less any deductions as hereinafter provided. The administrator may deduct from the cash deposited under this subdivision by a nonprofit organization or sell the securities it has so deposited to the extent necessary to satisfy any due and unpaid payments in lieu of contributions and any applicable interest and penalties provided for in subdivision (2) (E) of this subsection. The administrator shall require the organization within thirty days following any deduction from a cash deposit or sale of deposited securities under the provisions of this subparagraph to deposit sufficient additional cash or securities to make whole the organization's deposit at the prior level. Any cash remaining from the sale of such securities shall be a part of the organization's escrow account. The administrator may, at any time, review the adequacy of the deposit made by any organization. If, as a result of such review, the administrator determines that an adjustment is necessary, said administrator shall require the organization to make additional deposit within thirty days of written notice of determination or shall return to it such portion of the deposit as the administrator no longer considers necessary, whichever action is appropriate. Disposition of income from securities held in escrow shall be governed by any applicable provision of state law. (D) If any nonprofit organization fails to file a bond or make a deposit, or to file a bond in an increased amount or to increase or make whole the amount of a previously made deposit, as provided under this subdivision, the administrator may terminate such organization's election to make payments in lieu of contributions and such termination shall continue for not less than the four-consecutive-calendar-quarter period beginning with the quarter in which such termination becomes effective; provided the administrator may extend for good cause the applicable filing, deposit or adjustment period by not more than fifteen days.\n\n(4) If any nonprofit organization is delinquent in making payments in lieu of contributions as required under subdivision (2) of this subsection, and a bond or security as provided in subdivision (3) of this subsection has not been required, or required and not filed within thirty days, the administrator may terminate such organization's election to make payments in lieu of contributions as of the beginning of the next taxable year, and such termination shall be effective for that and the next taxable year.\n\n(5) Each employer that is liable for payments in lieu of contributions shall pay to the administrator for the fund the amount of regular and additional benefits plus the amount of one-half of extended benefits paid that are attributable to service in the employ of such employer. If benefits paid to an individual are based on wages paid by more than one employer and one or more of such employers are liable for payments in lieu of contributions, the amount payable to the fund by each employer that is liable for such payments, shall be an amount which bears the same ratio to the total benefits paid to the individual as the total base period wages paid to the individual by such employer bear to the total base period wages paid to the individual by all of the individual's base period employers.\n\n(6) Any two or more employers that have become liable for payments in lieu of contributions may file a joint application to the administrator for the establishment of a group account for the purpose of sharing the cost of benefits paid that are attributable to service in the employ of such employers. Each such application shall identify and authorize a group representative to act as the group's agent for the purposes of this subdivision. Upon the administrator's approval of the application, the administrator shall establish a group account for such employers effective as of the beginning of the calendar quarter in which the administrator receives the application and shall notify the group's representative of the effective date of the account. Such account shall remain in effect for not less than one year and thereafter until terminated at the discretion of the administrator or upon application by the group. Upon establishment of the account, each member of the group shall be liable for payments in lieu of contributions with respect to each calendar quarter in the amount that bears the same ratio to the total benefits paid in such quarter that are attributable to service performed in the employ of all members of the group as the total wages paid for service in employment by such member in such quarter bear to the total wages paid during such quarter for service performed in the employ of all members of the group. The administrator shall prescribe such regulations as he or she deems necessary with respect to applications for establishment, maintenance and termination of group accounts that are authorized by this subdivision, for addition of new members to, and withdrawal of active members from, such accounts, and for the determination of the amounts that are payable under this subdivision by members of the group and the time and manner of such payments.\n\n(h) Subsections (a) to (g), inclusive, of this section shall first apply to benefits charged with respect to benefits paid in benefit years starting on or after June 30, 1975.\n\n(i) Notwithstanding any other provision of the general statutes to the contrary, any employer, individual, organization, partnership, corporation or other legal entity which engages, in any manner, in contract construction activity in this state and which has its base of operations and is incorporated in another state, shall furnish to the administrator before beginning any such construction activity, a bond, with a surety or sureties satisfactory to the administrator, in an amount to be determined by the administrator. The administrator shall adopt regulations, in accordance with the provisions of chapter 54, establishing the method for computation of such bond amounts. The use of such bonds shall be limited to payment for any unpaid unemployment compensation contributions, interest and penalties due from such contractor and attributable to such contracted work."

              "(e) (1) (A) As of each June thirtieth, the administrator shall determine the charged tax rate for each qualified employer. Such rate shall be obtained by calculating a benefit ratio for each qualified employer. The employer's benefit ratio shall be the quotient obtained by dividing the total amount chargeable to the employer's experience account during the experience period by the total of his or her taxable wages during such experience period that have been reported by the employer to the administrator on or before the following September thirtieth. The resulting quotient, expressed as a per cent, shall constitute the employer's charged rate, except that each employer's charged rate for calendar years 2024, 2025, 2026 and 2027 shall be divided by 1.471, 1.269, 1.125 and 1.053, respectively.",

Sectors 21 and 23 of said system shall be considered one sector for the purposes of this subparagraph.",
              "(2) (A) Each contributing employer subject to this chapter shall pay an assessment to the administrator at a rate established by the administrator sufficient to pay interest due on advances from the federal unemployment account under Title XII of the Social Security Act (42 U.S. Code Sections 1321 to 1324).

The amounts received by the administrator based on such assessments shall be paid over to the State Treasurer and credited to the General Fund.

The administrator shall establish the assessments as a percentage of the charged tax rate for each employer pursuant to subdivision (1) of this subsection. The administrator shall establish the necessary procedures for billing, payment and collection of the assessments. Sections 31-265 to 31-274 , inclusive, shall apply to the collection of such assessments by the administrator.

An employer's maximum total liability for such benefits with respect to a claimant's benefit year shall bear the same ratio to the maximum total benefits payable to the claimant as the total wages paid by the employer to the claimant within his or her base period bears to the total wages paid by all employers to the claimant within his or her base period. This ratio shall also be applied to each benefit payment. The amount thus determined, rounded to the nearest dollar with fractions of a dollar of exactly fifty cents rounded upward, shall be charged to the employer's account.\n\n(c) (1) (A) Any week for which the employer has compensated the claimant in the form of wages in lieu of notice, dismissal payments or any similar payment for loss of wages shall be considered a week of employment for the purpose of determining employer chargeability.\n\n(B) No benefits shall be charged to any employer who paid wages of five hundred dollars or less to the claimant in his or her base period.\n\n(C) No dependency allowance paid to a claimant shall be charged to any employer.\n\n(D) In the event of a natural disaster declared by the President of the United States, no benefits paid on the basis of total or partial unemployment that is the result of physical damage to a place of employment caused by severe weather conditions including, but not limited to, hurricanes, snow storms, ice storms or flooding, or fire except where caused by the employer, shall be charged to any employer.\n\n(E) If the administrator finds that (i) an individual's most recent separation from a base period employer occurred under conditions that would result in disqualification by reason of subdivision (2), (6) or (9) of subsection (a) of section 31-236 , or (ii) an individual was discharged for violating an employer's drug testing policy, provided the policy has been adopted and applied consistent with sections 31-51t to 31-51aa , inclusive, section 14-261b and any applicable federal law, no benefits paid thereafter to such individual with respect to any week of unemployment that is based upon wages paid by such employer with respect to employment prior to such separation shall be charged to such employer's account, provided such employer shall have filed a notice with the administrator within the time allowed for appeal in section 31-241 .\n\n(F) No base period employer's account shall be charged with respect to benefits paid to a claimant if such employer continues to employ such claimant at the time the employer's account would otherwise have been charged to the same extent that he or she employed him or her during the individual's base period, provided the employer shall notify the administrator within the time allowed for appeal in section 31-241 .\n\n(G) If a claimant has failed to accept suitable employment under the provisions of subdivision (1) of subsection (a) of section 31-236 and the disqualification has been imposed, the account of the employer who makes an offer of employment to a claimant who was a former employee shall not be charged with any benefit payments made to such claimant after such initial offer of reemployment until such time as such claimant resumes employment with such employer, provided such employer shall make application therefor in a form acceptable to the administrator. The administrator shall notify such employer whether or not his or her application is granted. Any decision of the administrator denying suspension of charges as herein provided may be appealed within the time allowed for appeal in section 31-241 .\n\n(H) Fifty per cent of benefits paid to a claimant under the federal-state extended duration unemployment benefits program established by the federal Employment Security Act shall be charged to the experience accounts of the claimant's base period employers in the same manner as the regular benefits paid for such benefit year.\n\n(I) No base period employer's account shall be charged with respect to benefits paid to a claimant who voluntarily left suitable work with such employer (i) to care for a seriously ill spouse, parent or child, or (ii) due to the discontinuance of the transportation used by the claimant to get to and from work, as provided in subparagraphs (A)(ii) and (A)(iii) of subdivision (2) of subsection (a) of section 31-236 .\n\n(J) No base period employer's account shall be charged with respect to benefits paid to a claimant who has been discharged or suspended because the claimant has been disqualified from performing the work for which he or she was hired due to the loss of such claimant's operator license as a result of a drug or alcohol test or testing program conducted in accordance with section 14-44k , 14-227a or 14-227b while the claimant was off duty.\n\n(K) No base period employer's account shall be charged with respect to benefits paid to a claimant whose separation from employment is attributable to the return of an individual who was absent from work due to a bona fide leave taken pursuant to sections 31-49f to 31-49t , inclusive, or 31-51kk to 31-51qq , inclusive.\n\n(L) On and after January 1, 2024, (i) no base period employer's account shall be charged with respect to benefits paid to a claimant through the voluntary shared work unemployment compensation program established pursuant to section 31-274j , if a claim for benefits is filed in a week in which the average rate of total unemployment in the state equals or exceeds six and one-half per cent based on the most recent three months of data published by the Labor Commissioner, and (ii) the Labor Commissioner may determine that no base period employer's account shall be charged with respect to benefits paid to a claimant through the voluntary shared work unemployment compensation program established pursuant to section 31-274j , if a claim for benefits is filed in a week in which the average rate of total unemployment in the state equals or exceeds eight per cent in the most recent one month of data published by the Labor Commissioner.\n\n(2) All benefits paid that are not charged to any employer shall be pooled.\n\n(3) The noncharging provisions of this chapter, except subparagraphs (D), (F) and (K) of subdivision (1) of this subsection, shall not apply to reimbursing employers.\n\n(d) (1) The standard rate of contributions shall be five and four-tenths per cent. Each employer who has not been chargeable with benefits, for a sufficient period of time to have his or her rate computed under this section shall pay contributions at a rate that is the higher of (A) one per cent, or (B) the state's five-year benefit cost rate. For purposes of this subsection, the state's five-year benefit cost rate shall be computed annually on or before June thirtieth and shall be derived by dividing the total dollar amount of benefits paid to claimants under this chapter during the five consecutive calendar years immediately preceding the computation date by the five-year payroll during the same period, except that, to the extent allowed by federal law and as necessary to respond to the spread of COVID-19, for any taxable year commencing on or after January 1, 2022, the state's five-year benefit cost rate shall be calculated without regard to benefit payments and taxable wages for calendar years 2020 and 2021, when applicable.\n\n(2) For the period beginning January 1, 2023, and ending December 31, 2023, the state's five-year benefit cost rate shall be calculated pursuant to the formula under subdivision (1) of this subsection minus two-tenths of one per cent.\n\n(3) If the resulting quotient in this subsection is not an exact multiple of one-tenth of one per cent, the five-year benefit cost rate shall be the next higher such multiple.\n\n(e) (1) (A) As of each June thirtieth, the administrator shall determine the charged tax rate for each qualified employer. Such rate shall be obtained by calculating a benefit ratio for each qualified employer. The employer's benefit ratio shall be the quotient obtained by dividing the total amount chargeable to the employer's experience account during the experience period by the total of his or her taxable wages during such experience period that have been reported by the employer to the administrator on or before the following September thirtieth. The resulting quotient, expressed as a per cent, shall constitute the employer's charged rate, except that each employer's charged rate for calendar years 2024, 2025, 2026 and 2027 shall be divided by 1.471, 1.269, 1.125 and 1.053, respectively.\n\n(i) For calendar years commencing prior to January 1, 2024, if the resulting quotient is not an exact multiple of one-tenth of one per cent, the charged rate shall be the next higher such multiple, except that if the resulting quotient is less than five-tenths of one per cent, the charged rate shall be five-tenths of one per cent and if the resulting quotient is greater than five and four-tenths per cent, the charged rate shall be five and four-tenths per cent.\n\n(ii) For calendar years commencing on or after January 1, 2024, if the resulting quotient is not an exact multiple of one-tenth of one per cent, the charged rate shall be the next higher such multiple, except that if the resulting quotient is less than one-tenth of one per cent, the charged rate shall be one-tenth of one per cent and if the resulting quotient is greater than ten per cent, the charged rate shall be ten per cent.\n\n(B) For the calendar years commencing on and after January 1, 2024, if the benefit ratios calculated pursuant to subparagraph (A) of this subdivision would result in the average benefit ratio of all employers within a sector of the North American Industry Classification System increasing over the prior calendar year's such average by an amount equal to or greater than .01, the benefit ratio of each employer within such sector shall be adjusted downward by an amount equal to one-half of the increase in the average benefit ratio of all employers within such sector. Sectors 21 and 23 of said system shall be considered one sector for the purposes of this subparagraph.\n\n(2) (A) Each contributing employer subject to this chapter shall pay an assessment to the administrator at a rate established by the administrator sufficient to pay interest due on advances from the federal unemployment account under Title XII of the Social Security Act (42 U.S. Code Sections 1321 to 1324). The administrator shall establish the necessary procedures for payment of such assessments. The amounts received by the administrator based on such assessments shall be paid over to the State Treasurer and credited to the General Fund. Any amount remaining from such assessments, after all such federal interest charges have been paid, shall be transferred to the Employment Security Administration Fund or to the Unemployment Compensation Advance Fund established under section 31-264a , (i) to the extent that any federal interest charges have been paid from the Unemployment Compensation Advance Fund, (ii) to the extent that the administrator determines that reimbursement is appropriate, or (iii) otherwise to the extent that reimbursement of the advance fund is the appropriate accounting principle governing the use of the assessments. Sections 31-265 to 31-274 , inclusive, shall apply to the collection of such assessments.\n\n(B) On and after January 1, 1994, and conditioned upon the issuance of any revenue bonds pursuant to section 31-264b , each contributing employer shall also pay an assessment to the administrator at a rate established by the administrator sufficient to pay the interest due on advances from the Unemployment Compensation Advance Fund and reimbursements required for advances from the Unemployment Compensation Advance Fund, computed in accordance with subsection (h) of section 31-264a . The administrator shall establish the assessments as a percentage of the charged tax rate for each employer pursuant to subdivision (1) of this subsection. The administrator shall establish the necessary procedures for billing, payment and collection of the assessments. Sections 31-265 to 31-274 , inclusive, shall apply to the collection of such assessments by the administrator. The payments received by the administrator based on the assessments, excluding interest and penalties on past due assessments, are hereby pledged and shall be paid over to the State Treasurer for credit to the Unemployment Compensation Advance Fund.\n\n(f) (1) (A) For each calendar year commencing with calendar year 1994 but prior to calendar year 2013, the administrator shall establish a fund balance tax rate sufficient to maintain a balance in the Unemployment Compensation Trust Fund equal to eight-tenths of one per cent of the total wages paid to workers covered under this chapter by contributing employers during the year ending the last preceding June thirtieth. If the fund balance tax rate established by the administrator results in a fund balance in excess of said per cent as of December thirtieth of any year, the administrator shall, in the year next following, establish a fund balance tax rate sufficient to eliminate the fund balance in excess of said per cent.\n\n(B) For each calendar year commencing with calendar year 2013, the administrator shall establish a fund balance tax rate sufficient to maintain a balance in the Unemployment Compensation Trust Fund that results in an average high cost multiple equal to 0.5.\n\n(C) Commencing with calendar year 2014 and ending with calendar year 2018, the administrator shall establish a fund balance tax rate sufficient to maintain a balance in the Unemployment Compensation Trust Fund that results in an average high cost multiple that is increased by 0.1 from the preceding calendar year.\n\n(D) Commencing with calendar year 2019, the administrator shall establish a fund balance tax rate sufficient to maintain a balance in the Unemployment Compensation Trust Fund that results in an average high cost multiple equal to 1.0. If the fund balance tax rate established by the administrator results in a fund balance in excess of the amount prescribed in this subdivision as of December thirtieth of any year, the administrator shall, in the year next following, establish a fund balance rate sufficient to eliminate the fund balance in excess of said amount.\n\n(E) The assessment levied by the administrator at any time (i) during a calendar year commencing on or after January 1, 1994, but prior to January 1, 1999, shall not exceed one and five-tenths per cent, (ii) during a calendar year commencing on or after January 1, 1999, but prior to January 1, 2013, shall not exceed one and four-tenths per cent, and shall not be calculated to result in a fund balance in excess of eight-tenths of one per cent of such total wages, (iii) during a calendar year commencing on or after January 1, 2013, but prior to January 1, 2024, shall not exceed one and four-tenths per cent and shall not be calculated to result in a fund balance in excess of the amounts prescribed in this subdivision, (iv) during the calendar year beginning January 1, 2023, and ending December 31, 2023, shall not exceed one and two-tenths per cent and shall not be calculated to result in a fund balance in excess of the amounts prescribed in this subdivision, and (v) during a calendar year commencing on or after January 1, 2024, shall not exceed one per cent and shall not be calculated to result in a fund balance in excess of the amounts prescribed in this subdivision.\n\n(F) During a calendar year that begins during an economic recession declared by the National Bureau of Economic Research on or before November fifteenth of the prior calendar year, the assessment levied by the administrator shall not exceed one-half of one per cent unless such maximum rate jeopardizes the state's access to interest-free federal advances, including, but not limited to, those offered pursuant to 42 USC 1322 and subject to the funding goals established in 20 CFR 606.32, as amended from time to time.\n\n(2) The average high cost multiple shall be computed as follows: The result of the balance of the Unemployment Compensation Trust Fund on December thirtieth immediately preceding the new rate year divided by the total wages paid to workers covered under this chapter by contributing employers for the twelve months ending on the December thirtieth immediately preceding the new rate year shall be the numerator and the average of the three highest calendar benefit cost rates in (A) the last twenty years, or (B) a period including the last three recessions, whichever is longer, shall be the denominator. Benefit cost rates are computed as benefits paid including the state's share of extended benefits but excluding reimbursable benefits as a per cent of total wages in covered employment. The results rounded to the next lower one decimal place will be the average high cost multiple.\n\n(g) Each qualified employer's contribution rate for each calendar year after 1973 shall be a percentage rate equal to the sum of his or her charged tax rate as of the June thirtieth preceding such calendar year and the fund balance tax rate as of December thirtieth preceding such calendar year.\n\n(h) (1) With respect to each benefit year commencing on or after July 1, 1978, notice of determination of the claimant's benefit entitlement for such benefit year shall include notice of the allocation of benefit charges of the claimant's base period employers and each such employer shall be provided a copy of such notice of determination and shall be an interested party thereto. Such determination shall be final unless the claimant or any of such employers files an appeal from such decision in accordance with the provisions of section 31-241 .\n\n(2) The administrator shall, not less frequently than once each calendar quarter, provide a statement of charges to each employer to whose experience record any charges have been made since the last previous such statement. Such statement shall show, with respect to each week for which benefits have been paid and charged, the name and Social Security account number of the claimant who was paid the benefit, the amount of the benefits charged for such week and the total amount charged in the quarter.\n\n(3) The statement of charges provided for in subdivision (2) of this subsection shall constitute notice to the employer that it has been determined that the benefits reported in such statement were properly payable under this chapter to the claimants for the weeks and in the amounts shown in such statements. If the employer contends that benefits have been improperly charged due to fraud or error, a written protest setting forth reasons therefor shall be filed with the administrator within sixty days of the date the quarterly statement was provided. An eligibility issue shall not be reopened on the basis of such quarterly statement if notification of such eligibility issue had previously been given to the employer under the provisions of section 31-241 , and he or she failed to file a timely appeal therefrom or had the issue finally resolved against him or her.\n\n(4) The provisions of subdivisions (2) and (3) of this subsection shall not apply to combined wage claims paid under subsection (b) of section 31-255 . For such combined wage claims paid under the unemployment law of other states, the administrator shall, each calendar quarter, provide a statement of charges to each employer whose experience record has been charged since the previous such statement. Such statement shall show the name and Social Security number of the claimant who was paid the benefits and the total amount of the benefits charged in the quarter.\n\n(i) (1) At the written request of any employer that holds at least eighty per cent controlling interest in another employer or employers, the administrator may mingle the experience rating records of such dominant and controlled employers as if they constituted a single employer, subject to such regulations as the administrator may make and publish concerning the establishment, conduct and dissolution of such joint experience rating records.\n\n(2) The executors, administrators, successors or assigns of any former employer shall acquire the experience rating records of the predecessor employer with the following exception: The experience of a predecessor employer, who leased premises and equipment from a third party and who has not transferred any assets to the successor, shall not be transferred if there is no common controlling interest in the predecessor and successor entities.\n\n(3) The administrator is authorized to establish such regulations governing joint accounts as may be necessary to comply with the requirements of the federal Unemployment Tax Act.\n\n(j) (1) (A) Each employer subject to this chapter shall submit quarterly, on forms supplied by the administrator, a listing of wage information, including the name of each employee receiving wages in employment subject to this chapter, such employee's Social Security account number and the amount of wages paid to such employee during such calendar quarter.\n\n(B) Commencing with the third calendar quarter of 2026, any employer subject to this chapter may include in the quarterly filing submitted pursuant to subparagraph (A) of this subdivision, the following data for each employee receiving wages in employment subject to this chapter: (i) Such employee's occupation, (ii) such employee's hours worked, and (iii) the zip code of such employee's primary worksite.\n\n(2) Each employer subject to this chapter that reports wages for employees receiving wages in employment subject to this chapter, and each person or organization that, as an agent, reports wages for employees receiving wages in employment subject to this chapter on behalf of one or more employers subject to this chapter shall submit quarterly the information required by subdivision (1) of this subsection electronically, in a format and manner prescribed by the administrator, unless such employer or agent receives a waiver pursuant to subdivision (5) of this subsection.\n\n(3) Any employer that fails to submit the information required by subparagraph (A) of subdivision (1) of this subsection in a timely manner, as determined by the administrator, shall be liable to the administrator for a late filing fee of twenty-five dollars. Any employer that fails to submit the information required by subparagraph (A) of subdivision (1) of this subsection under a proper state unemployment compensation registration number shall be liable to the administrator for a fee of twenty-five dollars. All fees collected by the administrator under this subdivision shall be deposited in the Employment Security Administration Fund.\n\n(4) Each employer subject to this chapter that makes contributions or payments in lieu of contributions for employees receiving wages in employment subject to this chapter, and each person or organization that, as an agent, makes contributions or payments in lieu of contributions for employees receiving wages in employment subject to this chapter on behalf of one or more employers subject to this chapter shall make such contributions or payments in lieu of contributions electronically.\n\n(5) Any employer or any person or organization that, as an agent, is required to submit information pursuant to subdivision (2) of this subsection or make contributions or payments in lieu of contributions pursuant to subdivision (4) of this subsection may request in writing, not later than thirty days prior to the date a submission of information or a contribution or payment in lieu of contribution is due, that the administrator waive such requirement. The administrator shall grant such request if, on the basis of information provided by such employer or person or organization and on a form prescribed by the administrator, the administrator finds that there would be undue hardship for such employer or person or organization. The administrator shall promptly inform such employer or person or organization of the granting or rejection of the requested waiver. The decision of the administrator shall be final and not subject to further review or appeal. Such waiver shall be effective for twelve months from the date such waiver is granted.\n\n(k) The employer may inspect his or her account records in the office of the Employment Security Division at any reasonable time."

Any or all parties similarly situated may join in one appeal. In such judicial proceeding the original and five copies of a petition, which shall state the grounds on which a review is sought, shall be filed in the office of the board in a manner prescribed by the appeals division. The chairman of the board shall, within the third business day thereafter, cause the original petition or petitions to be mailed to the clerk of the Superior Court and copy or copies thereof to the administrator and to each other party to the proceeding in which such appeal was taken; and said clerk shall docket such appeal as returned to the next return day after the receipt of such petition or petitions. In all cases, the board shall certify the record to the court. The record shall consist of the notice of appeal to the referee and the board, the notices of hearing before them, the referee's findings of fact and decision, the findings and decision of the board, all documents admitted into evidence before the referee and the board or both and all other evidentiary material accepted by them. Upon request of the court, the board shall (1) in cases in which its decision was rendered on the record of such hearing before the referee, prepare and verify to the court a transcript of such hearing before the referee; and (2) in cases in which its decision was rendered on the record of its own evidentiary hearing, provide and verify to the court a transcript of such hearing of the board. In any appeal, any finding of the referee or the board shall be subject to correction only to the extent provided by section 22-9 of the Connecticut Practice Book. Such appeals shall be claimed for the short calendar unless the court shall order the appeal placed on the trial list. An appeal may be taken from the decision of the Superior Court to the Appellate Court in the same manner as is provided in section 51-197b . It shall not be necessary in any judicial proceeding under this section that exceptions to the rulings of the board shall have been made or entered and no bond shall be required for entering an appeal to the Superior Court. Unless the court shall otherwise order after motion and hearing, the final decision of the court shall be the decision as to all parties to the original proceeding. In any appeal in which one of the parties is not represented by counsel and in which the party taking the appeal does not claim the case for the short calendar or trial within a reasonable time after the return day, the court may of its own motion dismiss the appeal, or the party ready to proceed may move for nonsuit or default as appropriate. When an appeal is taken to the Superior Court, the clerk thereof shall by writing notify the board of any action of the court thereon and of the disposition of such appeal whether by judgment, remand, withdrawal or otherwise and shall, upon the decision on the appeal, furnish the board with a copy of such decision. The court may remand the case to the board for proceedings de novo, or for further proceedings on the record, or for such limited purposes as the court may prescribe. The court also may order the board to remand the case to a referee for any further proceedings deemed necessary by the court. The court may retain jurisdiction by ordering a return to the court of the proceedings conducted in accordance with the order of the court or the court may order final disposition. A party aggrieved by a final disposition made in compliance with an order of the Superior Court, by the filing of an appropriate motion, may request the court to review the disposition of the case."

Any or all parties similarly situated may join in one appeal. In such judicial proceeding the original and five copies of a petition, which shall state the grounds on which a review is sought, shall be filed in the office of the board in a manner prescribed by the appeals division. The chairman of the board shall, within the third business day thereafter, cause the original petition or petitions to be mailed to the clerk of the Superior Court and copy or copies thereof to the administrator and to each other party to the proceeding in which such appeal was taken; and said clerk shall docket such appeal as returned to the next return day after the receipt of such petition or petitions. In all cases, the board shall certify the record to the court. The record shall consist of the notice of appeal to the referee and the board, the notices of hearing before them, the referee's findings of fact and decision, the findings and decision of the board, all documents admitted into evidence before the referee and the board or both and all other evidentiary material accepted by them. Upon request of the court, the board shall (1) in cases in which its decision was rendered on the record of such hearing before the referee, prepare and verify to the court a transcript of such hearing before the referee; and (2) in cases in which its decision was rendered on the record of its own evidentiary hearing, provide and verify to the court a transcript of such hearing of the board. In any appeal, any finding of the referee or the board shall be subject to correction only to the extent provided by section 22-9 of the Connecticut Practice Book. Such appeals shall be claimed for the short calendar unless the court shall order the appeal placed on the trial list. An appeal may be taken from the decision of the Superior Court to the Appellate Court in the same manner as is provided in section 51-197b . It shall not be necessary in any judicial proceeding under this section that exceptions to the rulings of the board shall have been made or entered and no bond shall be required for entering an appeal to the Superior Court. Unless the court shall otherwise order after motion and hearing, the final decision of the court shall be the decision as to all parties to the original proceeding. In any appeal in which one of the parties is not represented by counsel and in which the party taking the appeal does not claim the case for the short calendar or trial within a reasonable time after the return day, the court may of its own motion dismiss the appeal, or the party ready to proceed may move for nonsuit or default as appropriate. When an appeal is taken to the Superior Court, the clerk thereof shall by writing notify the board of any action of the court thereon and of the disposition of such appeal whether by judgment, remand, withdrawal or otherwise and shall, upon the decision on the appeal, furnish the board with a copy of such decision. The court may remand the case to the board for proceedings de novo, or for further proceedings on the record, or for such limited purposes as the court may prescribe. The court also may order the board to remand the case to a referee for any further proceedings deemed necessary by the court. The court may retain jurisdiction by ordering a return to the court of the proceedings conducted in accordance with the order of the court or the court may order final disposition. A party aggrieved by a final disposition made in compliance with an order of the Superior Court, by the filing of an appropriate motion, may request the court to review the disposition of the case."

No agreement by an employee or by employees to pay all or any portion of an employer's contributions required under this chapter from such employer shall be valid. No employer shall, directly or indirectly, make or require or accept any deduction from the remuneration of individuals in his employ in order to finance the contributions required from such employer, or require or accept any waiver by an employee of any right hereunder.\n\n(b) Limitation on fees and costs. Registration of and rules of conduct for authorized agents. (1) Neither the administrator nor his representatives nor the board and its referees nor any court or officer thereof shall charge or tax any fees or costs against any employee or employer in any proceeding regarding claims for benefits under this chapter, except the record fee on appeal to the Appellate Court; but when any appeal is taken to the Superior Court from the finding of the board and such appeal is found by said court to be frivolous, said court may tax costs in its discretion against the appellant. (2) Any party to any proceeding before the administrator, an examiner, a referee or the board, may be represented by an attorney or authorized agent; but no attorney or authorized agent for an individual claiming benefits shall charge or receive for such services more than that amount approved by the administrator, or by the examiner, subject to revision by the administrator, by the referee or by the board before whom the proceedings are held, as the case may be. (3) No authorized agent may represent any party before a referee or the board for a fee unless the agent is registered with the board. The board shall adopt regulations, in accordance with chapter 54, containing rules for the conduct of authorized agents, including, but not limited to, individuals, organizations and businesses, that provide representation to parties before a referee or the board for a fee. The regulations shall require the registration of all such authorized agents in such manner as the board deems appropriate and shall establish penalties, including a fine not to exceed one thousand dollars per violation and revocation of registration, for the failure of any authorized agent to follow the rules of conduct established by the board. Nothing in this subdivision shall be construed to affect the practice of authorized agents representing parties before a referee or the board for a fee prior to the effective date of such regulations.\n\n(c) Limitations on assignment or garnishment of benefits. Except as provided in subsection (h) of section 31-227 , no assignment, pledge or encumbrance of any rights to benefits which are or may become due or payable under this chapter shall be valid; and such rights to benefits shall be exempt from levy, execution, attachment or any other process for the collection of debt until such benefits have been actually received by the employee. No waiver of any exemption provided for in this subsection shall be valid."

              "(a)(1) Any person who, through error, has received any sum as benefits under this chapter while any condition for the receipt of benefits imposed by this chapter was not fulfilled in his or her case, or has received a greater amount of benefits than was due him or her under this chapter, shall be charged with an overpayment of a sum equal to the amount so overpaid to him or her, provided such error has been discovered and brought to such person's attention within one year of the date of receipt of such benefits. A person whose receipt of such a sum was not due to fraud, wilful misrepresentation or wilful nondisclosure by himself or herself or another shall be entitled to a determination of eligibility by an examiner designated by the administrator that shall be based upon evidence or testimony presented in a manner prescribed by the administrator, including in writing, by telephone or by other electronic means. The examiner may prescribe a hearing by telephone or in person at his or her discretion, provided if an in person hearing is requested, the request may not be unreasonably denied by the examiner. Notice of the time and place of such hearing, and the reasons for such hearing, shall be given to the person not less than five days prior to the date appointed for such hearing. Such examiner shall determine whether: (A) Such person shall repay such sum to the administrator for the Unemployment Compensation Fund, (B) such sum shall be recouped by offset from such person's unemployment benefits, or (C) repayment or recoupment of such sum would defeat the purpose of the benefits or be against equity and good conscience and should be waived. In any case where the examiner determines that such sum shall be recouped by offset from a person's unemployment benefits, the deduction from benefits shall not exceed fifty per cent of the person's weekly benefit amount. Where such offset is insufficient to recoup the full amount of the overpayment, the claimant shall repay the remaining amount in accordance with a repayment schedule as determined by the examiner. If the claimant fails to repay according to the schedule, the administrator may recover such overpayment through a wage execution against the claimant's earnings upon his or her return to work in accordance with the provisions of section 52-361a , and the administrator may request the Commissioner of Administrative Services to seek reimbursement for such amount pursuant to section 12-742 . Any person with respect to whom a determination of overpayment has been made, according to the provisions of this subsection, shall be given notice of such determination and the provisions for repayment or recoupment of the amount overpaid. No repayment shall be required and no deduction from benefits shall be made until the determination of overpayment has become final.",
              "(2) The determination of overpayment shall be final unless the claimant, within twenty-one days after notice of such determination was provided to the claimant at his or her last-known address, files an appeal from such determination to a referee, except that any such appeal that is filed after such twenty-one-day period may be considered to be timely filed if the filing party shows good cause, as defined in regulations adopted pursuant to section 31-249h , for the late filing. If the last day for filing an appeal falls on any day when the offices of the Employment Security Division are not open for business, such last day shall be extended to the next business day. If any such appeal is filed by mail, the appeal shall be considered timely filed if the appeal was received within such twenty-one-day period or bears a legible United States postal service postmark that indicates that within such twenty-one-day period the appeal was placed in the possession of postal authorities for delivery to the appropriate office, except posting dates attributable to private postage meters shall not be considered in determining the timeliness of appeals filed by mail. If any such appeal is filed electronically, such appeal shall be considered timely filed if it was received within such twenty-one-day period.",
              "(3) The appeal shall be heard in the same manner provided in section 31-242 for an appeal from the decision of an examiner on a claim for benefits. Any party aggrieved by the decision of the referee, including the administrator, may appeal to the Employment Security Board of Review in the manner provided in section 31-249 . Decisions of the board may be appealed to the Superior Court in the manner provided in section 31-249b . The administrator is authorized, eight years after the payment of any benefits described in this subsection, to cancel any claim for such repayment or recoupment which in his or her opinion is uncollectible. Effective January 1, 1996, and annually thereafter, the administrator shall report to the joint standing committee of the General Assembly having cognizance of matters relating to finance, revenue and bonding and the joint standing committee of the General Assembly having cognizance of matters relating to labor and public employees, the aggregate number and value of all such claims deemed uncollectible and therefore cancelled during the previous calendar year. Any determination of overpayment made under this section which becomes final may be enforced by a wage execution in the same manner as a judgment of the Superior Court when the claimant fails to pay according to his or her repayment schedule. The court may issue a wage execution upon any final determination of overpayment in the same manner as in cases of judgments rendered in the Superior Court, and upon the filing of an application to the court for an execution, the administrator shall send to the clerk of the court a certified copy of such determination.",
              "(b) (1) Any person who, by reason of fraud, wilful misrepresentation or wilful nondisclosure by such person or by another of a material fact, has received any sum as benefits under this chapter while any condition for the receipt of benefits imposed by this chapter was not fulfilled in such person's case, or has received a greater amount of benefits than was due such person under this chapter, shall be charged with an overpayment and shall be liable to repay to the administrator for the Unemployment Compensation Fund a sum equal to the amount so overpaid to such person. If such person does not make repayment in full of the sum overpaid, the administrator shall recoup such sum by offset from such person's unemployment benefits. The deduction from benefits shall be one hundred per cent of the person's weekly benefit entitlement until the full amount of the overpayment has been recouped. Where such offset is insufficient to recoup the full amount of the overpayment, the claimant shall repay the remaining amount plus, for any determination of an overpayment made on or after July 1, 2005, interest at the rate of one per cent of the amount so overpaid per month, in accordance with a repayment schedule as determined by the examiner. If the claimant fails to repay according to the schedule, the administrator may recover such overpayment plus interest through a wage execution against the claimant's earnings upon the claimant's return to work in accordance with the provisions of section 52-361a . In addition, the administrator may request the Commissioner of Administrative Services to seek reimbursement for such amount pursuant to section 12-742 . If the administrator's actions are insufficient to recover such overpayment, the administrator may submit the outstanding balance to the Internal Revenue Service for the purpose of offsetting the claimant's federal tax refund pursuant to 26 USC 6402(f), 31 USC 3720A or other applicable federal laws. The administrator is authorized, eight years after the payment of any benefits described in this subsection, to cancel any claim for such repayment or recoupment which in the administrator's opinion is uncollectible. Effective January 1, 1996, and annually thereafter, the administrator shall report to the joint standing committee of the General Assembly having cognizance of matters relating to finance, revenue and bonding and the joint standing committee of the General Assembly having cognizance of matters relating to labor and public employees, the aggregate number and value of all such claims deemed uncollectible and therefore cancelled during the previous calendar year.",
              "(2) (A) For any determination of an overpayment made prior to October 1, 2013, any person who has made a claim for benefits under this chapter and has knowingly made a false statement or representation or has knowingly failed to disclose a material fact in order to obtain benefits or to increase the amount of benefits to which such person may be entitled under this chapter shall forfeit benefits for not less than one or more than thirty-nine compensable weeks following determination of such offense or offenses, during which weeks such person would otherwise have been eligible to receive benefits. For the purposes of section 31-231b , such person shall be deemed to have received benefits for such forfeited weeks. This penalty shall be in addition to any other applicable penalty under this section and in addition to the liability to repay any moneys so received by such person and shall not be confined to a single benefit year. The provisions of this subparagraph shall not be applicable to claims deemed payable as of October 1, 2019. (B) For any determination of an overpayment made on or after October 1, 2013, any person who has made a claim for benefits under this chapter and has knowingly made a false statement or representation or has knowingly failed to disclose a material fact in order to obtain benefits or to increase the amount of benefits to which such person may be entitled under this chapter shall be subject to a penalty of fifty per cent of the amount of overpayment for the first offense and a penalty of one hundred per cent of the amount of overpayment for any subsequent offense. This penalty shall be in addition to the liability to repay the full amount of overpayment and shall not be confined to a single benefit year. Thirty-five per cent of any such penalty shall be paid into the Unemployment Compensation Trust Fund and sixty-five per cent of such penalty shall be paid into the Employment Security Administration Fund. The penalty amounts computed in this subparagraph shall be rounded to the nearest dollar with fractions of a dollar of exactly fifty cents rounded upward.",
              "(3) Any person charged with the fraudulent receipt of benefits or the making of a fraudulent claim, as provided in this subsection, shall be entitled to a determination of eligibility by the administrator that shall be based upon evidence or testimony presented in a manner prescribed by the administrator including in writing, by telephone or by other electronic means. The administrator may prescribe a hearing by telephone or in person at his or her discretion, provided if an in person hearing is requested, the request may not be unreasonably denied by the administrator. Notice of the time and place of such hearing, and the reasons for such hearing, shall be given to the person not less than five days prior to the date appointed for such hearing. The administrator shall determine, on the basis of facts found by the administrator, whether or not a fraudulent act subject to the penalties of this subsection has been committed and, upon such finding, shall fix the penalty for any such offense according to the provisions of this subsection. Any person determined by the administrator to have committed fraud under the provisions of this section shall be liable for repayment to the administrator of the Unemployment Compensation Fund for any benefits determined by the administrator to have been collected fraudulently, as well as any other penalties assessed by the administrator in accordance with the provisions of this subsection. Until such liabilities have been met to the satisfaction of the administrator, such person shall forfeit any right to receive benefits under the provisions of this chapter. Notification of such decision and penalty shall be provided to such person and shall be final unless such person files an appeal not later than twenty-one days after the date such notification was provided to such person, except that (A) any such appeal that is filed after such twenty-one-day period may be considered to be timely filed if the filing party shows good cause, as defined in regulations adopted pursuant to section 31-249h , for the late filing, (B) if the last day for filing an appeal falls on any day when the offices of the Employment Security Division are not open for business, such last day shall be extended to the next business day, (C) if any such appeal is filed by mail, the appeal shall be considered timely filed if the appeal was received within such twenty-one-day period or bears a legible United States postal service postmark that indicates that within such twenty-one-day period the appeal was placed in the possession of postal authorities for delivery to the appropriate office, except posting dates attributable to private postage meters shall not be considered in determining the timeliness of appeals filed by mail, and (D) if any such appeal is filed electronically, such appeal shall be considered timely filed if it was received within such twenty-one-day period. Such appeal shall be heard by a referee in the same manner provided in section 31-242 for an appeal from the decision of an examiner on a claim for benefits. The manner in which such appeals shall be heard and appeals taken therefrom to the board of review and then to the Superior Court, either by the administrator or the claimant, shall be in accordance with the provisions set forth in section 31-249 or 31-249b , as the case may be. Any determination of overpayment made under this subsection which becomes final on or after October 1, 1995, may be enforced in the same manner as a judgment of the Superior Court when the claimant fails to pay according to the claimant's repayment schedule. The court may issue execution upon any final determination of overpayment in the same manner as in cases of judgments rendered in the Superior Court; and upon the filing of an application to the court for an execution, the administrator shall send to the clerk of the court a certified copy of such determination.",
              "(c) Any person, firm or corporation who knowingly employs a person and pays such employee without declaring such payment in the payroll records shall be guilty of a class A misdemeanor.",
              "(d) If, after investigation, the administrator determines that there is probable cause to believe that the person, firm or corporation has wilfully failed to declare payment of wages in the payroll record, the administrator shall provide an opportunity for a hearing on the matter. If a hearing is requested, it shall be conducted by the administrator, or a deputy or representative designated by the administrator. Notice of the time and place of such hearing, and the reasons therefor, shall be given to the person, firm, or corporation not less than five days prior to the date appointed for such hearing. If the administrator determines, on the basis of the facts found by him or her, that such nondeclaration occurred and was wilful, the administrator shall fix the payments and penalties in accordance with the provisions of subsection (e) of this section. Such person, firm or corporation may appeal to the superior court for the judicial district of Hartford or for the judicial district in which the employer's principal place of business is located. Such court shall give notice of a time and place of hearing to the administrator. At such hearing the court may confirm or correct the administrator's determination. If the administrator's determination is confirmed, the cost of such proceedings, as in civil actions, shall be assessed against such person, firm or corporation. No costs shall be assessed against the state on such appeal.",
              "(e) If the administrator determines that any person, firm or corporation has wilfully failed to declare the payment of wages on payroll records, the administrator may impose a penalty of ten per cent of the total contributions past due to the administrator, as determined pursuant to section 31-270 . Such penalty shall be in addition to any other applicable penalty and interest under section 31-266 . In addition, the administrator may require the person, firm or corporation to make contributions at the maximum rate provided in section 31-225a for a period of one year following the determination by the administrator concerning the wilful nondeclaration. If the person, firm or corporation is paying or should have been paying, the maximum rate at the time of the determination, the administrator may require that such maximum rate continue for a period of three years following the determination.",
              "(f) Any person who knowingly makes a false statement or representation or fails to disclose a material fact in order to obtain, increase, prevent or decrease any benefit, contribution or other payment under this chapter, or under any similar law of another state or of the United States in regard to which this state acted as agent pursuant to an agreement authorized by section 31-225 , whether to be made to or by himself or herself or any other person, and who receives any such benefit, pays any such contribution or alters any such payment to his or her advantage by such fraudulent means (1) shall be guilty of a class A misdemeanor if such benefit, contribution or payment amounts to five hundred dollars or less or (2) shall be guilty of a class D felony if such benefit, contribution or payment amounts to more than five hundred dollars. Notwithstanding the provisions of section 54-193 , no person shall be prosecuted for a violation of the provisions of this subsection committed on or after October 1, 1977, except within five years next after such violation has been committed.",
              "(g) Any person, firm or corporation who knowingly fails to pay contributions or other payments due under this chapter shall be guilty of a class A misdemeanor. Notwithstanding the provisions of section 54-193 , no person shall be prosecuted for a violation of the provisions of this subsection committed on or after October 1, 1987, except within five years after such violation has been committed.",
              "(h) Any person who knowingly violates any provision of this chapter for which no other penalty is provided by law shall be fined not more than two hundred dollars or imprisoned not more than six months or both.",
              "(i) Any person who wilfully violates any regulation made by the administrator or the board under the authority of this chapter, for which no penalty is specifically provided, shall be fined not more than two hundred dollars.",
              "(j) All interest payments collected by the administrator under subsection (b) of this section shall be deposited in the Employment Security Administration Fund.",
              "(k) For any determination of an overpayment made on or after October 1, 2013, if the administrator determines that an overpayment was caused by an employer's failure to timely or adequately respond to the administrator's request for information relating to a claim in a manner prescribed by the administrator, such employer shall not be relieved of its proportionate share of charges for each week determined to be overpaid.",

            "text": "(a)(1) Any person who, through error, has received any sum as benefits under this chapter while any condition for the receipt of benefits imposed by this chapter was not fulfilled in his or her case, or has received a greater amount of benefits than was due him or her under this chapter, shall be charged with an overpayment of a sum equal to the amount so overpaid to him or her, provided such error has been discovered and brought to such person's attention within one year of the date of receipt of such benefits. A person whose receipt of such a sum was not due to fraud, wilful misrepresentation or wilful nondisclosure by himself or herself or another shall be entitled to a determination of eligibility by an examiner designated by the administrator that shall be based upon evidence or testimony presented in a manner prescribed by the administrator, including in writing, by telephone or by other electronic means. The examiner may prescribe a hearing by telephone or in person at his or her discretion, provided if an in person hearing is requested, the request may not be unreasonably denied by the examiner. Notice of the time and place of such hearing, and the reasons for such hearing, shall be given to the person not less than five days prior to the date appointed for such hearing. Such examiner shall determine whether: (A) Such person shall repay such sum to the administrator for the Unemployment Compensation Fund, (B) such sum shall be recouped by offset from such person's unemployment benefits, or (C) repayment or recoupment of such sum would defeat the purpose of the benefits or be against equity and good conscience and should be waived. In any case where the examiner determines that such sum shall be recouped by offset from a person's unemployment benefits, the deduction from benefits shall not exceed fifty per cent of the person's weekly benefit amount. Where such offset is insufficient to recoup the full amount of the overpayment, the claimant shall repay the remaining amount in accordance with a repayment schedule as determined by the examiner. If the claimant fails to repay according to the schedule, the administrator may recover such overpayment through a wage execution against the claimant's earnings upon his or her return to work in accordance with the provisions of section 52-361a , and the administrator may request the Commissioner of Administrative Services to seek reimbursement for such amount pursuant to section 12-742 . Any person with respect to whom a determination of overpayment has been made, according to the provisions of this subsection, shall be given notice of such determination and the provisions for repayment or recoupment of the amount overpaid. No repayment shall be required and no deduction from benefits shall be made until the determination of overpayment has become final.\n\n(2) The determination of overpayment shall be final unless the claimant, within twenty-one days after notice of such determination was provided to the claimant at his or her last-known address, files an appeal from such determination to a referee, except that any such appeal that is filed after such twenty-one-day period may be considered to be timely filed if the filing party shows good cause, as defined in regulations adopted pursuant to section 31-249h , for the late filing. If the last day for filing an appeal falls on any day when the offices of the Employment Security Division are not open for business, such last day shall be extended to the next business day. If any such appeal is filed by mail, the appeal shall be considered timely filed if the appeal was received within such twenty-one-day period or bears a legible United States postal service postmark that indicates that within such twenty-one-day period the appeal was placed in the possession of postal authorities for delivery to the appropriate office, except posting dates attributable to private postage meters shall not be considered in determining the timeliness of appeals filed by mail. If any such appeal is filed electronically, such appeal shall be considered timely filed if it was received within such twenty-one-day period.\n\n(3) The appeal shall be heard in the same manner provided in section 31-242 for an appeal from the decision of an examiner on a claim for benefits. Any party aggrieved by the decision of the referee, including the administrator, may appeal to the Employment Security Board of Review in the manner provided in section 31-249 . Decisions of the board may be appealed to the Superior Court in the manner provided in section 31-249b . The administrator is authorized, eight years after the payment of any benefits described in this subsection, to cancel any claim for such repayment or recoupment which in his or her opinion is uncollectible. Effective January 1, 1996, and annually thereafter, the administrator shall report to the joint standing committee of the General Assembly having cognizance of matters relating to finance, revenue and bonding and the joint standing committee of the General Assembly having cognizance of matters relating to labor and public employees, the aggregate number and value of all such claims deemed uncollectible and therefore cancelled during the previous calendar year. Any determination of overpayment made under this section which becomes final may be enforced by a wage execution in the same manner as a judgment of the Superior Court when the claimant fails to pay according to his or her repayment schedule. The court may issue a wage execution upon any final determination of overpayment in the same manner as in cases of judgments rendered in the Superior Court, and upon the filing of an application to the court for an execution, the administrator shall send to the clerk of the court a certified copy of such determination.\n\n(b) (1) Any person who, by reason of fraud, wilful misrepresentation or wilful nondisclosure by such person or by another of a material fact, has received any sum as benefits under this chapter while any condition for the receipt of benefits imposed by this chapter was not fulfilled in such person's case, or has received a greater amount of benefits than was due such person under this chapter, shall be charged with an overpayment and shall be liable to repay to the administrator for the Unemployment Compensation Fund a sum equal to the amount so overpaid to such person. If such person does not make repayment in full of the sum overpaid, the administrator shall recoup such sum by offset from such person's unemployment benefits. The deduction from benefits shall be one hundred per cent of the person's weekly benefit entitlement until the full amount of the overpayment has been recouped. Where such offset is insufficient to recoup the full amount of the overpayment, the claimant shall repay the remaining amount plus, for any determination of an overpayment made on or after July 1, 2005, interest at the rate of one per cent of the amount so overpaid per month, in accordance with a repayment schedule as determined by the examiner. If the claimant fails to repay according to the schedule, the administrator may recover such overpayment plus interest through a wage execution against the claimant's earnings upon the claimant's return to work in accordance with the provisions of section 52-361a . In addition, the administrator may request the Commissioner of Administrative Services to seek reimbursement for such amount pursuant to section 12-742 . If the administrator's actions are insufficient to recover such overpayment, the administrator may submit the outstanding balance to the Internal Revenue Service for the purpose of offsetting the claimant's federal tax refund pursuant to 26 USC 6402(f), 31 USC 3720A or other applicable federal laws. The administrator is authorized, eight years after the payment of any benefits described in this subsection, to cancel any claim for such repayment or recoupment which in the administrator's opinion is uncollectible. Effective January 1, 1996, and annually thereafter, the administrator shall report to the joint standing committee of the General Assembly having cognizance of matters relating to finance, revenue and bonding and the joint standing committee of the General Assembly having cognizance of matters relating to labor and public employees, the aggregate number and value of all such claims deemed uncollectible and therefore cancelled during the previous calendar year.\n\n(2) (A) For any determination of an overpayment made prior to October 1, 2013, any person who has made a claim for benefits under this chapter and has knowingly made a false statement or representation or has knowingly failed to disclose a material fact in order to obtain benefits or to increase the amount of benefits to which such person may be entitled under this chapter shall forfeit benefits for not less than one or more than thirty-nine compensable weeks following determination of such offense or offenses, during which weeks such person would otherwise have been eligible to receive benefits. For the purposes of section 31-231b , such person shall be deemed to have received benefits for such forfeited weeks. This penalty shall be in addition to any other applicable penalty under this section and in addition to the liability to repay any moneys so received by such person and shall not be confined to a single benefit year. The provisions of this subparagraph shall not be applicable to claims deemed payable as of October 1, 2019. (B) For any determination of an overpayment made on or after October 1, 2013, any person who has made a claim for benefits under this chapter and has knowingly made a false statement or representation or has knowingly failed to disclose a material fact in order to obtain benefits or to increase the amount of benefits to which such person may be entitled under this chapter shall be subject to a penalty of fifty per cent of the amount of overpayment for the first offense and a penalty of one hundred per cent of the amount of overpayment for any subsequent offense. This penalty shall be in addition to the liability to repay the full amount of overpayment and shall not be confined to a single benefit year. Thirty-five per cent of any such penalty shall be paid into the Unemployment Compensation Trust Fund and sixty-five per cent of such penalty shall be paid into the Employment Security Administration Fund. The penalty amounts computed in this subparagraph shall be rounded to the nearest dollar with fractions of a dollar of exactly fifty cents rounded upward.\n\n(3) Any person charged with the fraudulent receipt of benefits or the making of a fraudulent claim, as provided in this subsection, shall be entitled to a determination of eligibility by the administrator that shall be based upon evidence or testimony presented in a manner prescribed by the administrator including in writing, by telephone or by other electronic means. The administrator may prescribe a hearing by telephone or in person at his or her discretion, provided if an in person hearing is requested, the request may not be unreasonably denied by the administrator. Notice of the time and place of such hearing, and the reasons for such hearing, shall be given to the person not less than five days prior to the date appointed for such hearing. The administrator shall determine, on the basis of facts found by the administrator, whether or not a fraudulent act subject to the penalties of this subsection has been committed and, upon such finding, shall fix the penalty for any such offense according to the provisions of this subsection. Any person determined by the administrator to have committed fraud under the provisions of this section shall be liable for repayment to the administrator of the Unemployment Compensation Fund for any benefits determined by the administrator to have been collected fraudulently, as well as any other penalties assessed by the administrator in accordance with the provisions of this subsection. Until such liabilities have been met to the satisfaction of the administrator, such person shall forfeit any right to receive benefits under the provisions of this chapter. Notification of such decision and penalty shall be provided to such person and shall be final unless such person files an appeal not later than twenty-one days after the date such notification was provided to such person, except that (A) any such appeal that is filed after such twenty-one-day period may be considered to be timely filed if the filing party shows good cause, as defined in regulations adopted pursuant to section 31-249h , for the late filing, (B) if the last day for filing an appeal falls on any day when the offices of the Employment Security Division are not open for business, such last day shall be extended to the next business day, (C) if any such appeal is filed by mail, the appeal shall be considered timely filed if the appeal was received within such twenty-one-day period or bears a legible United States postal service postmark that indicates that within such twenty-one-day period the appeal was placed in the possession of postal authorities for delivery to the appropriate office, except posting dates attributable to private postage meters shall not be considered in determining the timeliness of appeals filed by mail, and (D) if any such appeal is filed electronically, such appeal shall be considered timely filed if it was received within such twenty-one-day period. Such appeal shall be heard by a referee in the same manner provided in section 31-242 for an appeal from the decision of an examiner on a claim for benefits. The manner in which such appeals shall be heard and appeals taken therefrom to the board of review and then to the Superior Court, either by the administrator or the claimant, shall be in accordance with the provisions set forth in section 31-249 or 31-249b , as the case may be. Any determination of overpayment made under this subsection which becomes final on or after October 1, 1995, may be enforced in the same manner as a judgment of the Superior Court when the claimant fails to pay according to the claimant's repayment schedule. The court may issue execution upon any final determination of overpayment in the same manner as in cases of judgments rendered in the Superior Court; and upon the filing of an application to the court for an execution, the administrator shall send to the clerk of the court a certified copy of such determination.\n\n(c) Any person, firm or corporation who knowingly employs a person and pays such employee without declaring such payment in the payroll records shall be guilty of a class A misdemeanor.\n\n(d) If, after investigation, the administrator determines that there is probable cause to believe that the person, firm or corporation has wilfully failed to declare payment of wages in the payroll record, the administrator shall provide an opportunity for a hearing on the matter. If a hearing is requested, it shall be conducted by the administrator, or a deputy or representative designated by the administrator. Notice of the time and place of such hearing, and the reasons therefor, shall be given to the person, firm, or corporation not less than five days prior to the date appointed for such hearing. If the administrator determines, on the basis of the facts found by him or her, that such nondeclaration occurred and was wilful, the administrator shall fix the payments and penalties in accordance with the provisions of subsection (e) of this section. Such person, firm or corporation may appeal to the superior court for the judicial district of Hartford or for the judicial district in which the employer's principal place of business is located. Such court shall give notice of a time and place of hearing to the administrator. At such hearing the court may confirm or correct the administrator's determination. If the administrator's determination is confirmed, the cost of such proceedings, as in civil actions, shall be assessed against such person, firm or corporation. No costs shall be assessed against the state on such appeal.\n\n(e) If the administrator determines that any person, firm or corporation has wilfully failed to declare the payment of wages on payroll records, the administrator may impose a penalty of ten per cent of the total contributions past due to the administrator, as determined pursuant to section 31-270 . Such penalty shall be in addition to any other applicable penalty and interest under section 31-266 . In addition, the administrator may require the person, firm or corporation to make contributions at the maximum rate provided in section 31-225a for a period of one year following the determination by the administrator concerning the wilful nondeclaration. If the person, firm or corporation is paying or should have been paying, the maximum rate at the time of the determination, the administrator may require that such maximum rate continue for a period of three years following the determination.\n\n(f) Any person who knowingly makes a false statement or representation or fails to disclose a material fact in order to obtain, increase, prevent or decrease any benefit, contribution or other payment under this chapter, or under any similar law of another state or of the United States in regard to which this state acted as agent pursuant to an agreement authorized by section 31-225 , whether to be made to or by himself or herself or any other person, and who receives any such benefit, pays any such contribution or alters any such payment to his or her advantage by such fraudulent means (1) shall be guilty of a class A misdemeanor if such benefit, contribution or payment amounts to five hundred dollars or less or (2) shall be guilty of a class D felony if such benefit, contribution or payment amounts to more than five hundred dollars. Notwithstanding the provisions of section 54-193 , no person shall be prosecuted for a violation of the provisions of this subsection committed on or after October 1, 1977, except within five years next after such violation has been committed.\n\n(g) Any person, firm or corporation who knowingly fails to pay contributions or other payments due under this chapter shall be guilty of a class A misdemeanor. Notwithstanding the provisions of section 54-193 , no person shall be prosecuted for a violation of the provisions of this subsection committed on or after October 1, 1987, except within five years after such violation has been committed.\n\n(h) Any person who knowingly violates any provision of this chapter for which no other penalty is provided by law shall be fined not more than two hundred dollars or imprisoned not more than six months or both.\n\n(i) Any person who wilfully violates any regulation made by the administrator or the board under the authority of this chapter, for which no penalty is specifically provided, shall be fined not more than two hundred dollars.\n\n(j) All interest payments collected by the administrator under subsection (b) of this section shall be deposited in the Employment Security Administration Fund.\n\n(k) For any determination of an overpayment made on or after October 1, 2013, if the administrator determines that an overpayment was caused by an employer's failure to timely or adequately respond to the administrator's request for information relating to a claim in a manner prescribed by the administrator, such employer shall not be relieved of its proportionate share of charges for each week determined to be overpaid.\n\nSee Sec. 52-570e re action for damages resulting from violation of chapter."

Police officer's injuries while driving his children to day care before his shift were compensable because police officers are “portal-to-portal” employees and he was traveling his usual route to work when collision occurred. 157 CA 822. Although the definition of “occupational disease” may be derived from workers' compensation law, it does not follow that the term applies only to workers' compensation claims brought against one's own employer; clauses in asbestos liability insurance contracts that exclude coverage for occupational disease do not bar coverage only for occupational disease claims brought by a policyholder's own employees, but also apply to complainants who developed occupational disease while using the policyholder's products in the course of working for another employer. 171 CA 61; judgment affirmed, see 333 C. 343. Although the personal infirmity that caused plaintiff to fall backward and hit her head on the ground at her place of employment did not arise out of her employment, the resultant injuries that were caused by her head hitting the ground at her workplace did arise out of her employment. 182 CA 224; judgment reversed, see 339 C. 402."

              "(a) When any injury for which compensation is payable under the provisions of this chapter has been sustained under circumstances creating in a person other than an employer who has complied with the requirements of subsection (b) of section 31-284 , a legal liability to pay damages for the injury, the injured employee may claim compensation under the provisions of this chapter, but the payment or award of compensation shall not affect the claim or right of action of the injured employee against such person, but the injured employee may proceed at law against such person to recover damages for the injury; and any employer or the custodian of the Second Injury Fund, having paid, or having become obligated to pay, compensation under the provisions of this chapter may bring an action against such person to recover any amount that he has paid or has become obligated to pay as compensation to the injured employee. If the employee, the employer or the custodian of the Second Injury Fund brings an action against such person, he shall immediately notify the others, in writing, by personal presentation or by registered or certified mail, of the action and of the name of the court to which the writ is returnable, and the others may join as parties plaintiff in the action within thirty days after such notification, and, if the others fail to join as parties plaintiff, their right of action against such person shall abate unless the employer, insurance carrier or Second Injury Fund gives written notice of a lien in accordance with this subsection. In any case in which an employee brings an action against a party other than an employer who failed to comply with the requirements of subsection (b) of section 31-284 , in accordance with the provisions of this section, and the employer is a party defendant in the action, the employer may join as a party plaintiff in the action. The bringing of any action against an employer shall not constitute notice to the employer within the meaning of this section. If the employer and the employee join as parties plaintiff in the action and any damages are recovered, the damages shall be so apportioned that the claim of the employer, as defined in this section, shall take precedence over that of the injured employee in the proceeds of the recovery, after the deduction of reasonable and necessary expenditures, including attorneys' fees, incurred by the employee in effecting the recovery. If the action has been brought by the employee, the claim of the employer shall be reduced by one-third of the amount of the benefits to be reimbursed to the employer, unless otherwise agreed upon by the parties, which reduction shall inure solely to the benefit of the employee, except that such reduction shall not apply if the reimbursement is to the state of Connecticut or a political subdivision of the state including a local public agency, as the employer, or the custodian of the Second Injury Fund. The rendition of a judgment in favor of the employee or the employer against the party shall not terminate the employer's obligation to make further compensation which the administrative law judge thereafter deems payable to the injured employee. If the damages, after deducting the employee's expenses as provided in this subsection, are more than sufficient to reimburse the employer, damages shall be assessed in his favor in a sum sufficient to reimburse him for his claim, and the excess shall be assessed in favor of the injured employee. No compromise with the person by either the employer or the employee shall be binding upon or affect the rights of the other, unless assented to by him. For the purposes of this section, the claim of the employer shall consist of (1) the amount of any compensation which he has paid on account of the injury which is the subject of the suit, and (2) an amount equal to the present worth of any probable future payments which he has by award become obligated to pay on account of the injury. The word “compensation”, as used in this section, shall be construed to include incapacity payments to an injured employee, payments to the dependents of a deceased employee, sums paid out for surgical, medical and hospital services to an injured employee, the burial fee provided by subdivision (1) of subsection (a) of section 31-306 , payments made under the provisions of sections 31-312 and 31-313 , and payments made under the provisions of section 31-284b in the case of an action brought under this section by the employer or an action brought under this section by the employee in which the employee has alleged and been awarded such payments as damages. Each employee who brings an action against a party in accordance with the provisions of this subsection shall include in his complaint (A) the amount of any compensation paid by the employer or the Second Injury Fund on account of the injury which is the subject of the suit, and (B) the amount equal to the present worth of any probable future payments which the employer or the Second Injury Fund has, by award, become obligated to pay on account of the injury. Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection, when any injury for which compensation is payable under the provisions of this chapter has been sustained under circumstances creating in a person other than an employer who has complied with the requirements of subsection (b) of section 31-284 , a legal liability to pay damages for the injury and the injured employee has received compensation for the injury from such employer, its workers' compensation insurance carrier or the Second Injury Fund pursuant to the provisions of this chapter, the employer, insurance carrier or Second Injury Fund shall have a lien upon any judgment received by the employee against the party or any settlement received by the employee from the party, provided the employer, insurance carrier or Second Injury Fund shall give written notice of the lien to the party prior to such judgment or settlement.",
              "(b) When an injury for which compensation is payable under the provisions of this chapter is determined to be the result of a motor vehicle accident or other accident or circumstance in which a third person other than the employer was negligent and the claim is subrogated by the employer or its workers' compensation insurance carrier, the insurance carrier shall provide a rate adjustment to the employer's workers' compensation policy to reflect the recovery of any compensation paid by the insurance carrier prior to subrogation.",
              "(c) Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (a) of this section, no construction design professional who is retained to perform professional services on a construction project, or any employee of a construction design professional who is assisting or representing the construction design professional in the performance of professional services on the site of the construction project, shall be liable for any injury on the construction project for which compensation is payable under the provisions of this chapter, unless responsibility for safety practices is specifically assumed by contract. The immunity provided by this subsection to any construction design professional shall not apply to the negligent preparation of design plans or specifications. For the purposes of this subsection “construction design professional” means (1) any person licensed as an architect under the provisions of chapter 390, (2) any person licensed, or exempted from licensure, as an engineer under the provisions of chapter 391, or (3) any corporation organized to render professional services through the practice of either or both of such professions in this state.",
              "(d) Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (a) of this section, the furnishing of or the failure to furnish safety inspections or safety advisory services (1) by an insurer incident to providing workers' compensation insurance to an employer, (2) pursuant to a contract providing for safety inspections or safety advisory services between an employer and a self-insurance service organization incident to providing workers' compensation related services or (3) by a union representing employees of the employer, shall not subject the insurer or self-insurance service organization or their agents or employees, or the union, its members or the members of its safety committee, to third party liability for damages for injury, death or loss resulting therefrom unless the liability arises from a breach of a duty of fair representation of its members by a union. The immunity from liability extended under this subsection shall not be extended to any insurer or self-insurance service organization other than where the immunity is incident to the provision of workers' compensation insurance or workers' compensation related services."

If the employee, the employer or the custodian of the Second Injury Fund brings an action against such person, he shall immediately notify the others, in writing, by personal presentation or by registered or certified mail, of the action and of the name of the court to which the writ is returnable, and the others may join as parties plaintiff in the action within thirty days after such notification, and, if the others fail to join as parties plaintiff, their right of action against such person shall abate unless the employer, insurance carrier or Second Injury Fund gives written notice of a lien in accordance with this subsection. In any case in which an employee brings an action against a party other than an employer who failed to comply with the requirements of subsection (b) of section 31-284 , in accordance with the provisions of this section, and the employer is a party defendant in the action, the employer may join as a party plaintiff in the action. The bringing of any action against an employer shall not constitute notice to the employer within the meaning of this section. If the employer and the employee join as parties plaintiff in the action and any damages are recovered, the damages shall be so apportioned that the claim of the employer, as defined in this section, shall take precedence over that of the injured employee in the proceeds of the recovery, after the deduction of reasonable and necessary expenditures, including attorneys' fees, incurred by the employee in effecting the recovery. If the action has been brought by the employee, the claim of the employer shall be reduced by one-third of the amount of the benefits to be reimbursed to the employer, unless otherwise agreed upon by the parties, which reduction shall inure solely to the benefit of the employee, except that such reduction shall not apply if the reimbursement is to the state of Connecticut or a political subdivision of the state including a local public agency, as the employer, or the custodian of the Second Injury Fund. The rendition of a judgment in favor of the employee or the employer against the party shall not terminate the employer's obligation to make further compensation which the administrative law judge thereafter deems payable to the injured employee. If the damages, after deducting the employee's expenses as provided in this subsection, are more than sufficient to reimburse the employer, damages shall be assessed in his favor in a sum sufficient to reimburse him for his claim, and the excess shall be assessed in favor of the injured employee. No compromise with the person by either the employer or the employee shall be binding upon or affect the rights of the other, unless assented to by him. For the purposes of this section, the claim of the employer shall consist of (1) the amount of any compensation which he has paid on account of the injury which is the subject of the suit, and (2) an amount equal to the present worth of any probable future payments which he has by award become obligated to pay on account of the injury. The word “compensation”, as used in this section, shall be construed to include incapacity payments to an injured employee, payments to the dependents of a deceased employee, sums paid out for surgical, medical and hospital services to an injured employee, the burial fee provided by subdivision (1) of subsection (a) of section 31-306 , payments made under the provisions of sections 31-312 and 31-313 , and payments made under the provisions of section 31-284b in the case of an action brought under this section by the employer or an action brought under this section by the employee in which the employee has alleged and been awarded such payments as damages. Each employee who brings an action against a party in accordance with the provisions of this subsection shall include in his complaint (A) the amount of any compensation paid by the employer or the Second Injury Fund on account of the injury which is the subject of the suit, and (B) the amount equal to the present worth of any probable future payments which the employer or the Second Injury Fund has, by award, become obligated to pay on account of the injury. Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection, when any injury for which compensation is payable under the provisions of this chapter has been sustained under circumstances creating in a person other than an employer who has complied with the requirements of subsection (b) of section 31-284 , a legal liability to pay damages for the injury and the injured employee has received compensation for the injury from such employer, its workers' compensation insurance carrier or the Second Injury Fund pursuant to the provisions of this chapter, the employer, insurance carrier or Second Injury Fund shall have a lien upon any judgment received by the employee against the party or any settlement received by the employee from the party, provided the employer, insurance carrier or Second Injury Fund shall give written notice of the lien to the party prior to such judgment or settlement.\n\n(b) When an injury for which compensation is payable under the provisions of this chapter is determined to be the result of a motor vehicle accident or other accident or circumstance in which a third person other than the employer was negligent and the claim is subrogated by the employer or its workers' compensation insurance carrier, the insurance carrier shall provide a rate adjustment to the employer's workers' compensation policy to reflect the recovery of any compensation paid by the insurance carrier prior to subrogation.\n\n(c) Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (a) of this section, no construction design professional who is retained to perform professional services on a construction project, or any employee of a construction design professional who is assisting or representing the construction design professional in the performance of professional services on the site of the construction project, shall be liable for any injury on the construction project for which compensation is payable under the provisions of this chapter, unless responsibility for safety practices is specifically assumed by contract. The immunity provided by this subsection to any construction design professional shall not apply to the negligent preparation of design plans or specifications. For the purposes of this subsection “construction design professional” means (1) any person licensed as an architect under the provisions of chapter 390, (2) any person licensed, or exempted from licensure, as an engineer under the provisions of chapter 391, or (3) any corporation organized to render professional services through the practice of either or both of such professions in this state.\n\n(d) Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (a) of this section, the furnishing of or the failure to furnish safety inspections or safety advisory services (1) by an insurer incident to providing workers' compensation insurance to an employer, (2) pursuant to a contract providing for safety inspections or safety advisory services between an employer and a self-insurance service organization incident to providing workers' compensation related services or (3) by a union representing employees of the employer, shall not subject the insurer or self-insurance service organization or their agents or employees, or the union, its members or the members of its safety committee, to third party liability for damages for injury, death or loss resulting therefrom unless the liability arises from a breach of a duty of fair representation of its members by a union. The immunity from liability extended under this subsection shall not be extended to any insurer or self-insurance service organization other than where the immunity is incident to the provision of workers' compensation insurance or workers' compensation related services."

Workers' compensation legislation is remedial and should be broadly construed to accomplish its humanitarian purpose; where workers' compensation appeal involves issue of statutory construction that has not been subjected to judicial scrutiny, Supreme Court has plenary power to review the administrative decision. 252 C. 596. HIV is an occupational disease for correction officers who are members of emergency response units which are special teams of correction officers that respond to major disturbances and riots, and, therefore plaintiff's notice of claim was timely filed under statute; HIV is peculiar to and distinctively associated with decedent's occupation as a correction officer in an emergency response unit because of the direct causal connection between the specific duties of his employment, which required him to interact with inmates with a high HIV infection rate and in a manner that greatly increased the risk of contracting HIV and the AIDS the decedent contracted. 268 C. 753. Fact that an occupational disease cannot be qualified as such until a causal connection with exposure at employee's workplace can be established compels the conclusion that such a connection is a prerequisite to commencement of the statute of limitations for making a claim for an occupational disease. 280 C. 723. For purposes of section, commissioner must determine whether plaintiff's repetitive trauma injury more closely resembles “an accidental injury” or “occupational disease”. 296 C. 463. For purposes of determining limitation period, claim brought pursuant to Sec. 7-433c was properly treated as one for accidental injury definitely located in time and place, rather than a repetitive trauma injury, because plaintiff failed to present evidence that hypertension was causally connected to employment; formal diagnosis of hypertension or heart disease, communicated to an employee by his or her physician, constitutes the “injury” that triggers the running of the limitation period. 299 C. 265. Evidence that claimant had elevated blood pressure readings, or had been advised by physician to monitor blood pressure, is insufficient to trigger one year filing period under section, rather there must be evidence that claimant knew he or she suffered from hypertension, ordinarily shown by proof claimant was informed of diagnosis by a medical professional. 302 C. 755. Hypertension diagnosis is sufficient to trigger 1-year filing period and prescription of hypertension medication is not required. Id., 767. Board's imposition of 1-year statute of limitations for filing of survivor's benefits improper when a valid claim has previously been filed by either the employee or a representative; plaintiff was not required to file a separate timely notice of claim for survivor's benefits when decedent, during his lifetime, had filed a timely notice of claims for benefits that was accepted and paid. 320 C. 299.

Service on employer of amended complaint in third party action and employer's acknowledgment that it “may” become obligated to pay benefits to plaintiff are not sufficient to establish that employer had actual notice of plaintiff's intent to seek survivor's benefits as a result of decedent's death. 265 C. 525. Statute of limitations in Subsec. applies to all potential claims of employee's estate or his dependents and requires that a compensable claim be filed within the applicable limitations period, irrespective of whether initial claim is filed by the employee, the employee's estate after his death, or the decedent employee's dependents; proviso is not a condition precedent for commencement of dependents' claims, but rather a modified limitations period for commencement of such claims. 283 C. 813.

Because it was reasonable for Workers' Compensation Commissioner to determine that form 30c was filed on behalf of decedent's widow and sufficiently put defendants on notice of plaintiff's claim for survivor benefits, and because the savings provision of section cautions against arbitrary dismissal of plaintiff's claim, the claim was timely filed and the commissioner had subject matter jurisdiction over it. 150 CA 699.

Sending notice to contest liability to employee by certified mail meets requirements, despite employee's failure to claim it; notice to contest liability stating employee did not suffer an injury which arose out of or in the course of employment is not a general denial and therefore meets requirements for valid notice to contest liability; notice to contest liability form stating date of employee's injury differently than stated by employee on claim form did not render notice insufficient because date of injury stated by employer fell within the time period of claimed repetitive injury stated by employee. 138 CA 826.

In addition, an employer, opting to post where notice of a claim for compensation by an employee shall be sent, shall forward the address of where notice of a claim for compensation shall be sent to the Workers' Compensation Commission and the commission shall post such address on its Internet web site. An employer shall be responsible for verifying that information posted at a workplace location is consistent with the information posted on the commission's Internet web site. If an employee, other than an employee of the state or a municipality, opts to mail to his or her employer the written notice of a claim for compensation required under the provisions of this section, such written notice shall be sent by the employee to the employer in accordance with section 31-321 . As used in this section, “manifestation of a symptom” means manifestation to an employee claiming compensation, or to some other person standing in such relation to him that the knowledge of the person would be imputed to him, in a manner that is or should be recognized by him as symptomatic of the occupational disease for which compensation is claimed.\n\n(b) Whenever liability to pay compensation is contested by the employer, he shall file with the administrative law judge, on or before the twenty-eighth day after he has received a written notice of claim, a notice in accord with a form prescribed by the chairperson of the Workers' Compensation Commission stating that the right to compensation is contested, the name of the claimant, the name of the employer, the date of the alleged injury or death and the specific grounds on which the right to compensation is contested. The employer shall send a copy of the notice to the employee in accordance with section 31-321 . If the employer or his legal representative fails to file the notice contesting liability on or before the twenty-eighth day after he has received the written notice of claim, the employer shall commence payment of compensation for such injury or death on or before the twenty-eighth day after he has received the written notice of claim, but the employer may contest the employee's right to receive compensation on any grounds or the extent of his disability within one year from the receipt of the written notice of claim, provided the employer shall not be required to commence payment of compensation when the written notice of claim has not been properly served in accordance with section 31-321 or when the written notice of claim fails to include a warning that (1) the employer, if he has commenced payment for the alleged injury or death on or before the twenty-eighth day after receiving a written notice of claim, shall be precluded from contesting liability unless a notice contesting liability is filed within one year from the receipt of the written notice of claim, and (2) the employer shall be conclusively presumed to have accepted the compensability of the alleged injury or death unless the employer either files a notice contesting liability on or before the twenty-eighth day after receiving a written notice of claim or commences payment for the alleged injury or death on or before such twenty-eighth day. An employer shall be entitled, if he prevails, to reimbursement from the claimant of any compensation paid by the employer on and after the date the administrative law judge receives written notice from the employer or his legal representative, in accordance with the form prescribed by the chairperson of the Workers' Compensation Commission, stating that the right to compensation is contested. Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection, an employer who fails to contest liability for an alleged injury or death on or before the twenty-eighth day after receiving a written notice of claim and who fails to commence payment for the alleged injury or death on or before such twenty-eighth day, shall be conclusively presumed to have accepted the compensability of the alleged injury or death. If an employer has opted to post an address of where notice of a claim for compensation by an employee shall be sent, as described in subsection (a) of this section, the twenty-eight-day period set forth in this subsection shall begin on the date when such employer receives written notice of a claim for compensation at such posted address.\n\n(c) Failure to provide a notice of claim under subsection (a) of this section shall not bar maintenance of the proceedings if there has been a hearing or a written request for a hearing or an assignment for a hearing within a one-year period from the date of the accident or within a three-year period from the first manifestation of a symptom of the occupational disease, as the case may be, or if a voluntary agreement has been submitted within the applicable period, or if within the applicable period an employee has been furnished, for the injury with respect to which compensation is claimed, with medical or surgical care as provided in section 31-294d . No defect or inaccuracy of notice of claim shall bar maintenance of proceedings unless the employer shows that he was ignorant of the facts concerning the personal injury and was prejudiced by the defect or inaccuracy of the notice. Upon satisfactory showing of ignorance and prejudice, the employer shall receive allowance to the extent of the prejudice.\n\n(d) Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (a) of this section, a dependent or dependents of a deceased employee seeking compensation under section 31-306 who was barred by a final judgment in a court of law from filing a claim arising out of the death of the deceased employee, whose date of injury was between June 1, 1991, and June 30, 1991, and whose date of death was between November 1, 1992, and November 30, 1992, because of the failure of the dependent to timely file a separate death benefits claim, shall be allowed to file a written notice of claim for compensation not later than one year after July 8, 2005, and the administrative law judge shall have jurisdiction to determine such dependent's claim."

The administrative law judge shall, as part of the written award, inform the employee or the employee's dependent, as the case may be, of any rights the individual may have to an annual cost-of-living adjustment or to participate in a rehabilitation program administered by the Department of Aging and Disability Services under the provisions of this chapter. The administrative law judge shall retain the original findings and award in said administrative law judge's office. If no appeal from the decision is taken by either party within twenty days thereafter, such award shall be final and may be enforced in the same manner as a judgment of the Superior Court. The court may issue execution upon any uncontested or final award of an administrative law judge in the same manner as in cases of judgments rendered in the Superior Court; and, upon the filing of an application to the court for an execution, the administrative law judge in whose office the award is on file shall, upon the request of the clerk of said court, send to the clerk a certified copy of such findings and award. In cases where, through the fault or neglect of the employer or insurer, adjustments of compensation have been unduly delayed, or where through such fault or neglect, payments have been unduly delayed, the administrative law judge may include in the award interest at the rate prescribed in section 37-3a and a reasonable attorney's fee in the case of undue delay in adjustments of compensation and may include in the award in the case of undue delay in payments of compensation, interest at twelve per cent per annum and a reasonable attorney's fee. Payments not commenced within thirty-five days after the filing of a written notice of claim shall be presumed to be unduly delayed unless a notice to contest the claim is filed in accordance with section 31-297 . In cases where there has been delay in either adjustment or payment, which delay has not been due to the fault or neglect of the employer or insurer, whether such delay was caused by appeals or otherwise, the administrative law judge may allow interest at such rate, not to exceed the rate prescribed in section 37-3a , as may be fair and reasonable, taking into account whatever advantage the employer or insurer, as the case may be, may have had from the use of the money, the burden of showing that the rate in such case should be less than the rate prescribed in section 37-3a to be upon the employer or insurer. In cases where the claimant prevails and the administrative law judge finds that the employer or insurer has unreasonably contested liability, the administrative law judge may allow to the claimant a reasonable attorney's fee. No employer or insurer shall discontinue or reduce payment on account of total or partial incapacity under any such award, if it is claimed by or on behalf of the injured person that such person's incapacity still continues, unless such employer or insurer notifies the administrative law judge and the employee of such proposed discontinuance or reduction in the manner prescribed in section 31-296 and the administrative law judge specifically approves such discontinuance or reduction in writing. The administrative law judge shall render the decision within fourteen days of receipt of such notice and shall forward to all parties to the claim a copy of the decision not later than seven days after the decision has been rendered. If the decision of the administrative law judge finds for the employer or insurer, the injured person shall return any wrongful payments received from the day designated by the administrative law judge as the effective date for the discontinuance or reduction of benefits.

On January 1, 2022, and not later than each January first thereafter, the compensation for burial benefits shall be adjusted by the percentage increase between the last complete calendar year and the previous calendar year in the consumer price index for urban wage earners and clerical workers in the northeast, with no seasonal adjustment, as calculated by the United States Department of Labor's Bureau of Labor Statistics. If there is no one wholly or partially dependent upon the deceased employee, the burial expenses shall be paid to the person who assumes the responsibility of paying the funeral expenses.",

(A) The weekly compensation rate of each dependent entitled to receive compensation under this section as a result of death arising from a compensable injury occurring on or after October 1, 1977, shall be adjusted annually as provided in this subdivision as of the following October first, and each subsequent October first, to provide the dependent with a cost-of-living adjustment in the dependent's weekly compensation rate as determined as of the date of the injury under section 31-309 . If the maximum weekly compensation rate, as determined under the provisions of said section 31-309 , to be effective as of any October first following the date of the injury, is greater than the maximum weekly compensation rate prevailing at the date of the injury, the weekly compensation rate which the injured employee was entitled to receive at the date of the injury or October 1, 1990, whichever is later, shall be increased by the percentage of the increase in the maximum weekly compensation rate required by the provisions of said section 31-309 from the date of the injury or October 1, 1990, whichever is later, to such October first. The cost-of-living increases provided under this subdivision shall be paid by the employer without any order or award from the administrative law judge. The adjustments shall apply to each payment made in the next succeeding twelve-month period commencing with the October first next succeeding the date of the injury. With respect to any dependent receiving benefits on October 1, 1997, with respect to any injury occurring on or after July 1, 1993, and before October 1, 1997, such benefit shall be recalculated to October 1, 1997, as if such benefits had been subject to recalculation annually under this subparagraph. The difference between the amount of any benefits that would have been paid to such dependent if such benefits had been subject to such recalculation and the actual amount of benefits paid during the period between such injury and such recalculation shall be paid to the dependent not later than December 1, 1997, in a lump-sum payment. The employer or its insurer shall be reimbursed by the Second Injury Fund, as provided in section 31-354 , for adjustments, including lump-sum payments, payable under this subparagraph for deaths from compensable injuries occurring on or after July 1, 1993, and before October 1, 1997, upon presentation of any vouchers and information that the Treasurer shall require. No claim for payment of retroactive benefits may be made to the Second Injury Fund more than two years after the date on which the employer or its insurer paid such benefits in accordance with this subparagraph. (B) The weekly compensation rate of each dependent entitled to receive compensation under this section as a result of death arising from a compensable injury occurring on or before September 30, 1977, shall be adjusted as of October 1, 1977, and October 1, 1980, and thereafter, as provided in this subdivision to provide the dependent with partial cost-of-living adjustments in the dependent's weekly compensation rate. As of October 1, 1977, the weekly compensation rate paid prior to October 1, 1977, to the dependent shall be increased by twenty-five per cent. The partial cost-of-living adjustment provided under this subdivision shall be paid by the employer without any order or award from the administrative law judge. In addition, on each October first, the weekly compensation rate of each dependent as of October 1, 1990, shall be increased by the percentage of the increase in the maximum compensation rate over the maximum compensation rate of October 1, 1990, as determined under the provisions of section 31-309 existing on October 1, 1977. The cost of the adjustments shall be paid by the employer or its insurance carrier who shall be reimbursed for such cost from the Second Injury Fund as provided in section 31-354 upon presentation of any vouchers and information that the Treasurer shall require. No claim for payment of retroactive benefits may be made to the Second Injury Fund more than two years after the date on which the employer or its insurance carrier paid such benefits in accordance with this subparagraph.",

If, however, any of the presumptive dependent children are neither children of the surviving spouse nor living with the surviving spouse, the compensation shall be divided into as many parts as there are presumptive dependents. The shares of any children having a presumptive dependent parent shall be added to the share of the parent and shall be paid to the parent. The share of any dependent child not having a surviving dependent parent shall be paid to the father or mother of the child with whom the child may be living, or to the legal guardian of the child, or to any other person, for the benefit of the child, as the administrative law judge may direct.",

Each child shall receive compensation until the child reaches the age of eighteen or dies before reaching age eighteen, provided the child shall continue to receive compensation up to the attainment of the age of twenty-two if unmarried and a full-time student, except any child who has attained the age of twenty-two while a full-time student but has not completed the requirements for, or received, a degree from a postsecondary educational institution shall be deemed not to have attained age twenty-two until the first day of the first month following the end of the quarter or semester in which the child is enrolled at the time, or if the child is not enrolled in a quarter or semester system, until the first day of the first month following the completion of the course in which the child is enrolled or until the first day of the third month beginning after such time, whichever occurs first. When a child's participation ceases, such child's share shall be divided among the remaining eligible dependent children, provided if any child, when the child reaches the age of eighteen years, is physically or mentally incapacitated from earning, the child's right to compensation shall not terminate but shall continue for the full period of incapacity.",
              "(6) In all cases where there are no presumptive dependents, but where there are one or more persons wholly dependent in fact, the compensation in case of death shall be divided according to the relative degree of their dependence. Compensation payable under this subdivision shall be paid for not more than three hundred and twelve weeks from the date of the death of the employee. The compensation, if paid to those wholly dependent in fact, shall be paid at the full compensation rate. The compensation, if paid to those partially dependent in fact upon the deceased employee as of the date of the injury, shall not, in total, be more than the full compensation rate nor less than twenty dollars weekly, nor, if the average weekly sum contributed by the deceased at the date of the injury to those partially dependent in fact is more than twenty dollars weekly, not more than the sum so contributed.",

On January 1, 2022, and not later than each January first thereafter, the compensation for burial benefits shall be adjusted by the percentage increase between the last complete calendar year and the previous calendar year in the consumer price index for urban wage earners and clerical workers in the northeast, with no seasonal adjustment, as calculated by the United States Department of Labor's Bureau of Labor Statistics. If there is no one wholly or partially dependent upon the deceased employee, the burial expenses shall be paid to the person who assumes the responsibility of paying the funeral expenses.\n\n(2) To those wholly dependent upon the deceased employee at the date of the deceased employee's injury, a weekly compensation equal to seventy-five per cent of the average weekly earnings of the deceased calculated pursuant to section 31-310 , after such earnings have been reduced by any deduction for federal or state taxes, or both, and for the federal Insurance Contributions Act made from such employee's total wages received during the period of calculation of the employee's average weekly wage pursuant to said section 31-310 , as of the date of the injury but not more than the maximum weekly compensation rate set forth in section 31-309 for the year in which the injury occurred or less than twenty dollars weekly. (A) The weekly compensation rate of each dependent entitled to receive compensation under this section as a result of death arising from a compensable injury occurring on or after October 1, 1977, shall be adjusted annually as provided in this subdivision as of the following October first, and each subsequent October first, to provide the dependent with a cost-of-living adjustment in the dependent's weekly compensation rate as determined as of the date of the injury under section 31-309 . If the maximum weekly compensation rate, as determined under the provisions of said section 31-309 , to be effective as of any October first following the date of the injury, is greater than the maximum weekly compensation rate prevailing at the date of the injury, the weekly compensation rate which the injured employee was entitled to receive at the date of the injury or October 1, 1990, whichever is later, shall be increased by the percentage of the increase in the maximum weekly compensation rate required by the provisions of said section 31-309 from the date of the injury or October 1, 1990, whichever is later, to such October first. The cost-of-living increases provided under this subdivision shall be paid by the employer without any order or award from the administrative law judge. The adjustments shall apply to each payment made in the next succeeding twelve-month period commencing with the October first next succeeding the date of the injury. With respect to any dependent receiving benefits on October 1, 1997, with respect to any injury occurring on or after July 1, 1993, and before October 1, 1997, such benefit shall be recalculated to October 1, 1997, as if such benefits had been subject to recalculation annually under this subparagraph. The difference between the amount of any benefits that would have been paid to such dependent if such benefits had been subject to such recalculation and the actual amount of benefits paid during the period between such injury and such recalculation shall be paid to the dependent not later than December 1, 1997, in a lump-sum payment. The employer or its insurer shall be reimbursed by the Second Injury Fund, as provided in section 31-354 , for adjustments, including lump-sum payments, payable under this subparagraph for deaths from compensable injuries occurring on or after July 1, 1993, and before October 1, 1997, upon presentation of any vouchers and information that the Treasurer shall require. No claim for payment of retroactive benefits may be made to the Second Injury Fund more than two years after the date on which the employer or its insurer paid such benefits in accordance with this subparagraph. (B) The weekly compensation rate of each dependent entitled to receive compensation under this section as a result of death arising from a compensable injury occurring on or before September 30, 1977, shall be adjusted as of October 1, 1977, and October 1, 1980, and thereafter, as provided in this subdivision to provide the dependent with partial cost-of-living adjustments in the dependent's weekly compensation rate. As of October 1, 1977, the weekly compensation rate paid prior to October 1, 1977, to the dependent shall be increased by twenty-five per cent. The partial cost-of-living adjustment provided under this subdivision shall be paid by the employer without any order or award from the administrative law judge. In addition, on each October first, the weekly compensation rate of each dependent as of October 1, 1990, shall be increased by the percentage of the increase in the maximum compensation rate over the maximum compensation rate of October 1, 1990, as determined under the provisions of section 31-309 existing on October 1, 1977. The cost of the adjustments shall be paid by the employer or its insurance carrier who shall be reimbursed for such cost from the Second Injury Fund as provided in section 31-354 upon presentation of any vouchers and information that the Treasurer shall require. No claim for payment of retroactive benefits may be made to the Second Injury Fund more than two years after the date on which the employer or its insurance carrier paid such benefits in accordance with this subparagraph.\n\n(3) If the surviving spouse is the sole presumptive dependent, compensation shall be paid until death or remarriage.\n\n(4) If there is a presumptive dependent spouse surviving and also one or more presumptive dependent children, all of which children are either children of the surviving spouse or are living with the surviving spouse, the entire compensation shall be paid to the surviving spouse in the same manner and for the same period as if the surviving spouse were the sole dependent. If, however, any of the presumptive dependent children are neither children of the surviving spouse nor living with the surviving spouse, the compensation shall be divided into as many parts as there are presumptive dependents. The shares of any children having a presumptive dependent parent shall be added to the share of the parent and shall be paid to the parent. The share of any dependent child not having a surviving dependent parent shall be paid to the father or mother of the child with whom the child may be living, or to the legal guardian of the child, or to any other person, for the benefit of the child, as the administrative law judge may direct.\n\n(5) If the compensation being paid to the surviving presumptive dependent spouse terminates for any reason, or if there is no surviving presumptive dependent spouse at the time of the death of the employee, but there is at either time one or more presumptive dependent children, the compensation shall be paid to the children as a class, each child sharing equally with the others. Each child shall receive compensation until the child reaches the age of eighteen or dies before reaching age eighteen, provided the child shall continue to receive compensation up to the attainment of the age of twenty-two if unmarried and a full-time student, except any child who has attained the age of twenty-two while a full-time student but has not completed the requirements for, or received, a degree from a postsecondary educational institution shall be deemed not to have attained age twenty-two until the first day of the first month following the end of the quarter or semester in which the child is enrolled at the time, or if the child is not enrolled in a quarter or semester system, until the first day of the first month following the completion of the course in which the child is enrolled or until the first day of the third month beginning after such time, whichever occurs first. When a child's participation ceases, such child's share shall be divided among the remaining eligible dependent children, provided if any child, when the child reaches the age of eighteen years, is physically or mentally incapacitated from earning, the child's right to compensation shall not terminate but shall continue for the full period of incapacity.\n\n(6) In all cases where there are no presumptive dependents, but where there are one or more persons wholly dependent in fact, the compensation in case of death shall be divided according to the relative degree of their dependence. Compensation payable under this subdivision shall be paid for not more than three hundred and twelve weeks from the date of the death of the employee. The compensation, if paid to those wholly dependent in fact, shall be paid at the full compensation rate. The compensation, if paid to those partially dependent in fact upon the deceased employee as of the date of the injury, shall not, in total, be more than the full compensation rate nor less than twenty dollars weekly, nor, if the average weekly sum contributed by the deceased at the date of the injury to those partially dependent in fact is more than twenty dollars weekly, not more than the sum so contributed.\n\n(7) When the sole presumptive dependents are, at the time of the injury, nonresident aliens and the deceased has in this state some person or persons who are dependent in fact, the administrative law judge may in the administrative law judge's discretion equitably apportion the sums payable as compensation to the dependents.\n\n(b) The dependents of any deceased employee who was injured on or after January 1, 1974, and who subsequently dies shall be paid compensation on account of the death retroactively to the date of the employee's death. The cost of the payment or adjustment shall be paid by the employer or its insurance carrier who shall be reimbursed for such cost from the Second Injury Fund as provided in section 31-354 upon presentation of any vouchers and information that the Treasurer shall require.\n\n(c) (1) The dependents of any deceased employee who was injured between January 1, 1952, and December 31, 1973, and who subsequently dies, shall be paid compensation on account of the death retroactively to the date of the employee's death. The cost of the payment or adjustment shall be paid by the employer or its insurance carrier who shall be reimbursed for such cost from the Second Injury Fund as provided in section 31-354 upon presentation of any vouchers and information that the Treasurer shall require. No claim for payment of retroactive benefits may be made to the Second Injury Fund more than two years after the date on which the employer or its insurance carrier paid such benefits in accordance with this subdivision.\n\n(2) The dependents of any deceased employee who was injured before January 1, 1952, and who died on or before October 1, 1991, shall be paid compensation on account of the death retroactively to the date of the employee's death. The cost of the payment or adjustment shall be paid by the employer or its insurance carrier who shall be reimbursed for such cost from the Second Injury Fund as provided in section 31-354 upon presentation of any vouchers and information that the Treasurer shall require. No claim for payment of retroactive benefits may be made to the Second Injury Fund more than two years after the date on which the employer or its insurance carrier paid such benefits in accordance with this subdivision.\n\n(d) The dependents of any deceased employee who was injured in an accident arising out of and in the course of employment before January 1, 1952, and who died, as a result of those injuries, after October 1, 1991, shall be paid compensation, under the provisions of this section, effective as of the date of death of any such employee. Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (a) of this section, the weekly compensation rate for such dependents shall equal the amount of compensation the injured employee was receiving prior to death pursuant to section 31-307 . Such weekly compensation rate shall hereafter be adjusted in accordance with the provisions of subsection (a) of this section. The cost of such payment or adjustment shall be paid by the employer or the insurance carrier of such employer who shall be reimbursed for such cost from the Second Injury Fund provided for in section 31-354 . No claim for payment of retroactive benefits may be made to the Second Injury Fund more than two years after the date on which the employer or its insurance carrier paid such benefits in accordance with this subsection."

If the maximum weekly compensation rate as determined under the provisions of section 31-309 , to be effective as of any October first following the date of the injury, is greater than the maximum weekly compensation rate prevailing as of the date of the injury, the weekly compensation rate which the injured employee was entitled to receive at the date of the injury or October 1, 1990, whichever is later, shall be increased by the percentage of the increase in the maximum weekly compensation rate required by the provisions of section 31-309 from the date of the injury or October 1, 1990, whichever is later, to such October first. The cost-of-living increases provided under this subsection shall be paid by the employer without any order or award from the administrative law judge. The adjustments shall apply to each payment made in the next succeeding twelve-month period commencing with the October first next succeeding the date of the injury.\n\n(b) The weekly compensation rate of each employee entitled to receive compensation under section 31-307 as a result of an injury sustained prior to October 1, 1969, which has disabled the employee for a period extending to October 1, 1969, or thereafter shall be adjusted as of October 1, 1969, and annually thereafter, as provided in this subsection to provide the injured employee with a partial cost-of-living adjustment in his or her weekly compensation rate. The weekly compensation rate paid prior to October 1, 1969, to the injured employee shall be increased as of October 1, 1969, by the amount that the maximum weekly compensation rate as determined under section 31-309 to be effective for injuries sustained on or after October 1, 1969, is greater than the maximum weekly compensation rate as determined under section 31-309 to be effective for injuries sustained on or after October 1, 1965, or the date of the injury, whichever is later, but not more than fifteen dollars per week. Thereafter, increases, if any, for cost-of-living as provided in subsection (a) of this section shall be added to the amount of weekly compensation payable as of the date of the injury or October 1, 1990, whichever is later. The partial cost-of-living adjustments provided under this subsection shall be paid by the employer without any order or award from the administrative law judge. The adjustments shall apply to each payment made in the next twelve-month period, on or after October 1, 1969. The cost of the adjustments shall be paid by the employer or the employer's insurance carrier who shall be reimbursed therefor from the Second Injury Fund as provided in section 31-354 upon presentation of any vouchers and information that the Treasurer shall require. No claim for payment of retroactive benefits may be made to the Second Injury Fund more than two years after the date on which the employer or its insurance carrier paid such benefits in accordance with this subsection.\n\n(c) On and after October 1, 1997, the weekly compensation rate of each employee entitled to receive compensation under section 31-307 as a result of an injury sustained on or after July 1, 1993, which totally incapacitates the employee permanently, shall be adjusted as provided in this subsection as of October 1, 1997, or the October first following the injury date, whichever is later, and annually on each subsequent October first, to provide the injured employee with a cost-of-living adjustment in his or her weekly compensation rate as determined as of the date of injury under section 31-309 . If the maximum weekly compensation rate, as determined under the provisions of said section 31-309 , to be effective as of any October first following the date of the injury, is greater than the maximum weekly compensation rate prevailing as of the date of injury, the weekly compensation rate which the injured employee was entitled to receive as of the date of injury shall be increased by the percentage of the increase in the maximum weekly compensation rate required by the provisions of said section 31-309 from the date of the injury to such October first. The cost-of-living adjustments provided under this subdivision shall be paid by the employer without any order or award from the administrative law judge. The adjustments shall apply to each payment made in the next succeeding twelve-month period commencing with October 1, 1997, or the October first next succeeding the date of injury, whichever is later. With respect to any employee receiving benefits on October 1, 1997, with respect to any such injury occurring on or after July 1, 1993, and before October 1, 1997, or with respect to any employee who was adjudicated to be totally incapacitated permanently subsequent to the date of his or her injury or is totally incapacitated permanently due to the fact that the employee has been totally incapacitated by such an injury for a period of five years or more, such benefit shall be recalculated to October 1, 1997, to the date of such adjudication or to the end of such five-year period, as the case may be, as if such benefits had been subject to recalculation annually under the provisions of this subsection. The difference between the amount of any benefits which would have been paid to such employee if such benefits had been subject to such recalculation and the actual amount of benefits paid during the period between such injury and such recalculation shall be paid to the dependent not later than December 1, 1997, or thirty days after such adjudication or the end of such period, as the case may be, in a lump-sum payment. The employer or the employer's insurer shall be reimbursed by the Second Injury Fund, as provided in section 31-354 , for adjustments, including lump-sum payments, payable under this subsection for compensable injuries occurring on or after July 1, 1993, and before October 1, 1997, upon presentation of any vouchers and information that the Treasurer shall require. No claim for payment of retroactive benefits may be made to the Second Injury Fund more than two years after the date on which the employer or its insurance carrier paid such benefits in accordance with this subsection."

              "(a) For the purposes of this chapter, the average weekly wage shall be ascertained by dividing the total wages received by the injured employee from the employer in whose service the employee is injured during the fifty-two calendar weeks immediately preceding the week during which the employee was injured, by the number of calendar weeks during which, or any portion of which, the employee was actually employed by the employer, but, in making the computation, absence for seven consecutive calendar days, although not in the same calendar week, shall be considered as absence for a calendar week. When the employment commenced otherwise than at the beginning of a calendar week, that calendar week and wages earned during that week shall be excluded in making the computation. When the period of employment immediately preceding the injury is computed to be less than a net period of two calendar weeks, the employee's weekly wage shall be considered to be equivalent to the average weekly wage prevailing in the same or similar employment in the same locality at the date of the injury except that, when the employer has agreed to pay a certain hourly wage to the employee, the hourly wage so agreed upon shall be the hourly wage for the injured employee and the employee's average weekly wage shall be computed by multiplying the hourly wage by the regular number of hours that is permitted each week in accordance with the agreement. For the purpose of determining the amount of compensation to be paid in the case of a minor under the age of eighteen who has sustained an injury entitling the employee to compensation for total or partial incapacity for a period of fifty-two or more weeks, or to specific indemnity for any injury under the provisions of section 31-308 , the administrative law judge may add fifty per cent to the employee's average weekly wage, except in the case of a minor under the age of sixteen, the administrative law judge may add one hundred per cent to the minor's average weekly wage. When the injured employee is a trainee or apprentice receiving a subsistence allowance from the United States because of war service, the allowance shall be added to the injured employee's actual earnings in determining the average weekly wage. Where the injured employee has worked for more than one employer as of the date of the injury and the average weekly wage received from the employer in whose employ the injured employee was injured, as determined under the provisions of this section, are insufficient to obtain the maximum weekly compensation rate from the employer under section 31-309 , prevailing as of the date of the injury, the injured employee's average weekly wages shall be calculated upon the basis of wages earned from all such employers in the period of concurrent employment not in excess of fifty-two weeks prior to the date of the injury, but the employer in whose employ the injury occurred shall be liable for all medical and hospital costs and a portion of the compensation rate equal to seventy-five per cent of the average weekly wage paid by the employer to the injured employee, after such earnings have been reduced by any deduction for federal or state taxes, or both, and for the federal Insurance Contribution Act made from such employee's total wages received from such employer during the period of calculation of such average weekly wage, but not less than an amount equal to the minimum compensation rate prevailing as of the date of the injury. The remaining portion of the applicable compensation rate shall be paid from the Second Injury Fund upon submission to the Treasurer by the employer or the employer's insurer of such vouchers and information as the Treasurer may require. For purposes of this subsection, the Second Injury Fund shall not be deemed an employer or an insurer for any claim brought on behalf of an insolvent insurer and shall be exempt from liability, unless such claim is brought not later than thirty days after a determination of such insurer's bankruptcy. No claim for payment of retroactive benefits may be made to the Second Injury Fund more than two years from the date on which the employer or its insurer paid such benefits in accordance with this subsection. In cases which involve concurrent employment and in which there is a claim against a third party, the injured employee or the employer in whose employ the injury was sustained or the employer's insurer shall advise the custodian of the Second Injury Fund if there is a third party claim, and the employee, employer or employer's insurer shall pursue its subrogation rights as provided for in section 31-293 and shall include in its claim all compensation paid by the Second Injury Fund and shall reimburse the Second Injury Fund for all payments made for compensation in the event of a recovery against the third party.",

When the employment commenced otherwise than at the beginning of a calendar week, that calendar week and wages earned during that week shall be excluded in making the computation. When the period of employment immediately preceding the injury is computed to be less than a net period of two calendar weeks, the employee's weekly wage shall be considered to be equivalent to the average weekly wage prevailing in the same or similar employment in the same locality at the date of the injury except that, when the employer has agreed to pay a certain hourly wage to the employee, the hourly wage so agreed upon shall be the hourly wage for the injured employee and the employee's average weekly wage shall be computed by multiplying the hourly wage by the regular number of hours that is permitted each week in accordance with the agreement. For the purpose of determining the amount of compensation to be paid in the case of a minor under the age of eighteen who has sustained an injury entitling the employee to compensation for total or partial incapacity for a period of fifty-two or more weeks, or to specific indemnity for any injury under the provisions of section 31-308 , the administrative law judge may add fifty per cent to the employee's average weekly wage, except in the case of a minor under the age of sixteen, the administrative law judge may add one hundred per cent to the minor's average weekly wage. When the injured employee is a trainee or apprentice receiving a subsistence allowance from the United States because of war service, the allowance shall be added to the injured employee's actual earnings in determining the average weekly wage. Where the injured employee has worked for more than one employer as of the date of the injury and the average weekly wage received from the employer in whose employ the injured employee was injured, as determined under the provisions of this section, are insufficient to obtain the maximum weekly compensation rate from the employer under section 31-309 , prevailing as of the date of the injury, the injured employee's average weekly wages shall be calculated upon the basis of wages earned from all such employers in the period of concurrent employment not in excess of fifty-two weeks prior to the date of the injury, but the employer in whose employ the injury occurred shall be liable for all medical and hospital costs and a portion of the compensation rate equal to seventy-five per cent of the average weekly wage paid by the employer to the injured employee, after such earnings have been reduced by any deduction for federal or state taxes, or both, and for the federal Insurance Contribution Act made from such employee's total wages received from such employer during the period of calculation of such average weekly wage, but not less than an amount equal to the minimum compensation rate prevailing as of the date of the injury. The remaining portion of the applicable compensation rate shall be paid from the Second Injury Fund upon submission to the Treasurer by the employer or the employer's insurer of such vouchers and information as the Treasurer may require. For purposes of this subsection, the Second Injury Fund shall not be deemed an employer or an insurer for any claim brought on behalf of an insolvent insurer and shall be exempt from liability, unless such claim is brought not later than thirty days after a determination of such insurer's bankruptcy. No claim for payment of retroactive benefits may be made to the Second Injury Fund more than two years from the date on which the employer or its insurer paid such benefits in accordance with this subsection. In cases which involve concurrent employment and in which there is a claim against a third party, the injured employee or the employer in whose employ the injury was sustained or the employer's insurer shall advise the custodian of the Second Injury Fund if there is a third party claim, and the employee, employer or employer's insurer shall pursue its subrogation rights as provided for in section 31-293 and shall include in its claim all compensation paid by the Second Injury Fund and shall reimburse the Second Injury Fund for all payments made for compensation in the event of a recovery against the third party.\n\n(b) Each August fifteenth, the chairperson of the Workers' Compensation Commission, in consultation with the advisory board, shall publish tables of the average weekly wage and seventy-five per cent of the average weekly wage after being reduced by any deduction for federal or state taxes, or both, and for the federal Insurance Contributions Act, to be effective the following October first, except that not later than June thirtieth, the chairperson, in consultation with the advisory board, shall publish tables of the average weekly wage and seventy-five per cent of the average weekly wage after being reduced by any deduction for federal or state taxes, or both, and for the federal Insurance Contributions Act, to be effective during the period July 1, 1993, to October 1, 1993. Such tables shall be conclusive for the purpose of determining seventy-five per cent of the average weekly earnings of an injured employee after such earnings have been reduced by any deduction for federal or state taxes, or both, and for the federal Insurance Contributions Act made from such employee's total wages received during the period of calculation of the employee's average weekly wage for purposes of sections 31-306 , 31-307 and 31-308 ."

Denial of a motion to reopen award is proper subject of a separate appeal; motion to reopen on ground of mistake denied. Id., 361. Cited. 137 C. 187; Id., 487. Status of dependent in fact involves three factual elements: (1) Reliance on contributions of decedent for necessary living expenses, (2) a reasonable expectation that the contributions will continue, (3) an absence of sufficient means at hand for meeting these expenses; the first two are fixed at the time of injury and consequently the measure of dependence in section can change from that existing at the time of injury only if there is a subsequent change in the financial resources of claimant. 152 C. 481. Where commissioner found claimant was partial dependent at time of injury but subsequently received sufficient funds from other sources to supply her present necessities, commissioner correctly concluded that, although claimant was dependent in fact at the time of injury, her “measure of dependence” had changed before the time of the hearing and consequently defendants were relieved from paying compensation to her unless and until she showed a further change in circumstances; award to a dependent in fact as well as to a presumptive dependent is award of compensation and subject to modification. Id., 481, 482.

Authority to modify otherwise final awards does not authorize modifications based on changes of law. 244 C. 1. A motion to open or modify was not required under section because commissioner and parties considered application for total incapacity benefits to be the equivalent of such a motion, commissioner applied the applicable standard, there was no showing of prejudice to defendants, and it would violate public policy to deny benefits because of a failure to frame application for total incapacity benefits as a motion to open or modify. 294 C. 564.

No insurer or employer who is self-insured in whole or in part shall engage in writing insurance under this chapter or providing the compensation and benefits directly to employees unless he files with the Insurance Commissioner a receipt from the State Treasurer or the Comptroller on or before the first day of October, that the employer has paid his pro rata cost of administration required by this section or if the self-insured employer has not, prior to July first of any year, provided compensation and benefits under this chapter, the self-insured employer shall file such receipt on or before October first, annually that he has paid an amount equal to one-quarter of one per cent of the self-insured employer's payroll for the twelve months immediately preceding such July first.\n\n(b) (1) When, after the close of a fiscal year ending prior to July 1, 1990, the chairperson of the Workers' Compensation Commission and the Comptroller have determined the total amount of expenses of the Workers' Compensation Commission in accordance with the provisions of subsection (d) of section 31-280 , the Treasurer shall thereupon assess upon and collect from each employer, other than the state and any municipality participating for purposes of its liability under this chapter as a member in an interlocal risk management agency pursuant to chapter 113a, the proportion of such expenses that the total compensation and payment for hospital, medical and nursing care made by such self-insured employer or private insurance carrier acting on behalf of any such employer bore to the total compensation and payments for hospital, medical and nursing care made by all such insurance carriers and self-insurers. The amount so secured shall be used to reimburse the Treasurer for appropriations theretofore made by the state for the payment in the first instance of the expenses of administering this chapter. On and after July 1, 1986, the Treasurer shall, as soon as possible after the close of a fiscal year ending prior to July 1, 1990, estimate the pro rata cost to each employer based upon the costs assessed to such employer in the immediately preceding fiscal year and shall assess upon and collect from each such employer such estimated costs annually which shall be payable as provided in subsection (a) of this section except each annual assessment shall include an amount which represents the difference between the payments collected and the actual costs assessed to such employer for the immediately preceding fiscal year. The Treasurer is authorized to make credits or rebates for overpayments made under this subsection by any employer for any fiscal year.\n\n(2) The chairperson of the Workers' Compensation Commission shall annually, on or after July first of each fiscal year, determine an amount sufficient in the chairperson's judgment to meet the expenses incurred by the Workers' Compensation Commission and the Department of Aging and Disability Services in providing rehabilitation services for employees suffering compensable injuries in accordance with section 31-283a . Such expenses shall include (A) the costs of the Division of Workers' Rehabilitation and the programs established by its director, for fiscal years prior to the fiscal year beginning July 1, 2011, (B) the costs of the Division of Worker Education and the programs established by its director, and (C) funding for the occupational health clinic program created pursuant to sections 31-396 to 31-402 , inclusive. The Treasurer shall thereupon assess upon and collect from each employer, other than the state and any municipality participating for purposes of its liability under this chapter as a member in an interlocal risk management agency pursuant to chapter 113a, the proportion of such expenses, based on the immediately preceding fiscal year, that the total compensation and payment for hospital, medical and nursing care made by such self-insured employer or private insurance carrier acting on behalf of any such employer bore to the total compensation and payments for the immediately preceding fiscal year for hospital, medical and nursing care made by such insurance carriers and self-insurers. For the fiscal years ending June 30, 2000, and June 30, 2001, such assessments shall not exceed five per cent of such total compensation and payments made by such insurance carriers and self-insurers. For the fiscal years ending June 30, 2002, and June 30, 2003, such assessments shall not exceed four and one-half per cent of such total compensation and payments made by such insurance carriers and self-insurers. For any fiscal year ending on or after June 30, 2004, such assessment shall not exceed four per cent of such total compensation and payments made by such insurance carriers and self-insurers. Such assessments and expenses shall not exceed the budget estimates submitted in accordance with subsection (c) of section 31-280 . For each fiscal year, such assessment shall be reduced pro rata by the amount of any surplus from the assessments of prior fiscal years. Said surplus shall be determined in accordance with subdivision (3) of this subsection. Such assessments shall be made in one annual assessment upon receipt of the chairperson's expense determination by the Treasurer. All assessments shall be paid not later than sixty days following the date of the assessment by the Treasurer. Any employer who fails to pay such assessment to the Treasurer within the time prescribed by this subdivision shall pay interest to the Treasurer on the assessment at the rate of eight per cent per annum from the date the assessment is due until the date of payment. All assessments received by the Treasurer pursuant to this subdivision to meet the expenses of the Workers' Compensation Commission shall be deposited in the Workers' Compensation Administration Fund established under section 31-344a . All assessments received by the Treasurer pursuant to this subdivision to meet the expenses incurred by the Department of Aging and Disability Services in providing rehabilitation services for employees suffering compensable injuries in accordance with section 31-283a shall be deposited in the Workers' Compensation Administration Fund. The Treasurer is hereby authorized to make credits or rebates for overpayments made under this subsection by any employer for any fiscal year.\n\n(3) As soon as practicable after the close of the state fiscal year, the Comptroller shall examine the Workers' Compensation Administration Fund and shall direct the State Treasurer to set aside within said fund amounts in excess of fifty per cent of the expenditures of the Workers' Compensation Commission for the most recently completed fiscal year, which shall be considered a surplus for purposes of subdivision (2) of subsection (b) of this section."

Such sum shall be an amount sufficient to (1) pay the debt service on state revenue bond obligations authorized to be issued under and for the purposes set forth in section 31-354b including reserve and covenant coverage requirements, (2) provide for costs and expenses of operating the Second Injury Fund, and (3) pay Second Injury Fund stipulations on claims settled by the custodian or other benefits payable out of the Second Injury Fund and not funded through state revenue bond obligations and shall be determined in accordance with the regulations adopted pursuant to the provisions of section 31-349g . The custodian shall establish a factor for the annual surcharge that caps such surcharge for the fiscal years ending June 30, 1996, 1997 and 1998. In determining such factor the custodian shall consider the funding mechanism authorized by sections 31-349g , 31-349h and 31-349i , this section, section 31-354b and sections 8 and 9 of public act 96-242*, recognize that an acceptable level of employer assessment is important to the vitality of the economy of the state and nevertheless shall assure provision of services to injured workers that enhances their ability to return to work and improve their quality of life. In any event, such factor shall not exceed, with respect to insured employers, a rate of fifteen per cent on the Second Injury Fund surcharge base with respect to workers' compensation and employers' liability policies and, with respect to self-insured employers, a comparable percentage limitation representing their pro rata share of any assessment. Any employer or any insurance company acting as collection agent for the custodian of the Second Injury Fund who fails to pay in accordance with such regulations shall pay a penalty to the State Treasurer of fifteen per cent on the unpaid assessment or surcharge or fifty dollars, whichever is greater. Interest at the rate of six per cent per annum shall be charged on any amounts owed on assessment audits or surcharge audits. For self-insured employers interest shall accrue thirty days after notice from the Second Injury Fund of the unpaid audit assessment. For insurance companies, the interest shall accrue from the date of the notice of audit errors or deficiencies as determined by the date postmarked by the United States Postal Service. The State Treasurer shall notify each employer of the penalty or interest provision with the notice of assessment. Any partial payments made to the fund shall be first applied to any unpaid penalty, then to any unpaid interest and the remainder, if any, to the unpaid assessment or surcharge. Interest or penalties shall be applied if assessment or surcharge reports or payments are postmarked by the United States Postal Service after the designated due date. The sums received shall be accounted for separately and apart from all other state moneys and the faith and credit of the state of Connecticut is pledged for their safekeeping. The State Treasurer shall be the custodian of the fund and all disbursements from the fund shall be made by the Treasurer or the Treasurer's deputies. The moneys of the fund shall be invested by the Treasurer in accordance with applicable law and section 8 of public act 96-242*. Interest, income and dividends from the investments shall be credited to the fund. Each employer, each private insurance carrier acting on behalf of any employer and each interlocal risk management agency acting on behalf of any employer shall annually, on or before April first, report to the State Treasurer, in the form prescribed by the State Treasurer, the amount of money expended by or on behalf of the employer in payments for the preceding calendar year. Each private insurance carrier, each self-insurance group and each interlocal risk management agency shall submit annually, on or before April first, to the State Treasurer, in the form prescribed by the State Treasurer, a report of the total Second Injury Fund surcharge base collected in the preceding calendar year and a report of the projected total Second Injury Fund surcharge base for the current calendar year. The fund shall be used to provide the benefits set forth in section 31-306 for adjustments in the compensation rate and payment of certain death benefits, in section 31-307b for adjustments where there are relapses after a return to work, in section 31-307c for totally disabled persons injured prior to October 1, 1953, in section 31-349 for disabled or handicapped employees and in section 31-355 for the payment of benefits due injured employees whose employers or insurance carriers have failed to pay the compensation, and medical expenses required by this chapter, or any other compensation payable from the fund as may be required by any provision contained in this chapter or any other statute and to reimburse employers or insurance carriers for payments made under subsection (b) of section 31-307a . The assessment required by this section is a condition of doing business in this state and failure to pay the assessment, when due, shall result in the denial of the privilege of doing business in this state or to self-insure under section 31-284 . Any administrative or other costs or expenses incurred by the State Treasurer in connection with carrying out the provisions of this part, including the hiring of necessary employees, shall be paid from the fund. The State Treasurer may adopt regulations, in accordance with the provisions of chapter 54, prescribing the practices, policies and procedures to be followed in the administration of the Second Injury Fund.",
              "(b) The State Treasurer shall establish within the Second Injury Fund three accounts to be known as the operating account, the settlement account and the finance account which accounts shall be held separate and apart from each other. The operating account shall cover the costs and expenses to the state of operating the Second Injury Fund. The settlement account shall cover actual disbursement of the settled claims whether by one-time full payments or by payments over a period of time.

The custodian shall establish a factor for the annual surcharge that caps such surcharge for the fiscal years ending June 30, 1996, 1997 and 1998. In determining such factor the custodian shall consider the funding mechanism authorized by sections 31-349g , 31-349h and 31-349i , this section, section 31-354b and sections 8 and 9 of public act 96-242*, recognize that an acceptable level of employer assessment is important to the vitality of the economy of the state and nevertheless shall assure provision of services to injured workers that enhances their ability to return to work and improve their quality of life. In any event, such factor shall not exceed, with respect to insured employers, a rate of fifteen per cent on the Second Injury Fund surcharge base with respect to workers' compensation and employers' liability policies and, with respect to self-insured employers, a comparable percentage limitation representing their pro rata share of any assessment. Any employer or any insurance company acting as collection agent for the custodian of the Second Injury Fund who fails to pay in accordance with such regulations shall pay a penalty to the State Treasurer of fifteen per cent on the unpaid assessment or surcharge or fifty dollars, whichever is greater. Interest at the rate of six per cent per annum shall be charged on any amounts owed on assessment audits or surcharge audits. For self-insured employers interest shall accrue thirty days after notice from the Second Injury Fund of the unpaid audit assessment. For insurance companies, the interest shall accrue from the date of the notice of audit errors or deficiencies as determined by the date postmarked by the United States Postal Service. The State Treasurer shall notify each employer of the penalty or interest provision with the notice of assessment. Any partial payments made to the fund shall be first applied to any unpaid penalty, then to any unpaid interest and the remainder, if any, to the unpaid assessment or surcharge. Interest or penalties shall be applied if assessment or surcharge reports or payments are postmarked by the United States Postal Service after the designated due date. The sums received shall be accounted for separately and apart from all other state moneys and the faith and credit of the state of Connecticut is pledged for their safekeeping. The State Treasurer shall be the custodian of the fund and all disbursements from the fund shall be made by the Treasurer or the Treasurer's deputies. The moneys of the fund shall be invested by the Treasurer in accordance with applicable law and section 8 of public act 96-242*. Interest, income and dividends from the investments shall be credited to the fund. Each employer, each private insurance carrier acting on behalf of any employer and each interlocal risk management agency acting on behalf of any employer shall annually, on or before April first, report to the State Treasurer, in the form prescribed by the State Treasurer, the amount of money expended by or on behalf of the employer in payments for the preceding calendar year. Each private insurance carrier, each self-insurance group and each interlocal risk management agency shall submit annually, on or before April first, to the State Treasurer, in the form prescribed by the State Treasurer, a report of the total Second Injury Fund surcharge base collected in the preceding calendar year and a report of the projected total Second Injury Fund surcharge base for the current calendar year. The fund shall be used to provide the benefits set forth in section 31-306 for adjustments in the compensation rate and payment of certain death benefits, in section 31-307b for adjustments where there are relapses after a return to work, in section 31-307c for totally disabled persons injured prior to October 1, 1953, in section 31-349 for disabled or handicapped employees and in section 31-355 for the payment of benefits due injured employees whose employers or insurance carriers have failed to pay the compensation, and medical expenses required by this chapter, or any other compensation payable from the fund as may be required by any provision contained in this chapter or any other statute and to reimburse employers or insurance carriers for payments made under subsection (b) of section 31-307a . The assessment required by this section is a condition of doing business in this state and failure to pay the assessment, when due, shall result in the denial of the privilege of doing business in this state or to self-insure under section 31-284 . Any administrative or other costs or expenses incurred by the State Treasurer in connection with carrying out the provisions of this part, including the hiring of necessary employees, shall be paid from the fund. The State Treasurer may adopt regulations, in accordance with the provisions of chapter 54, prescribing the practices, policies and procedures to be followed in the administration of the Second Injury Fund.\n\n(b) The State Treasurer shall establish within the Second Injury Fund three accounts to be known as the operating account, the settlement account and the finance account which accounts shall be held separate and apart from each other. The operating account shall cover the costs and expenses to the state of operating the Second Injury Fund. The settlement account shall cover actual disbursement of the settled claims whether by one-time full payments or by payments over a period of time. The finance account shall contain such funds and be operated in the manner provided in section 31-354b .\n\nSee Sec. 31-289 re deposit of certain fines and penalties in Second Injury Fund."

            "text": "(a) The administrative law judge shall give notice to the Treasurer of all hearing of matters that may involve payment from the Second Injury Fund, and may make an award directing the Treasurer to make payment from the fund.\n\n(b) When an award of compensation has been made under the provisions of this chapter against an employer who failed, neglected, refused or is unable to pay any type of benefit coming due as a consequence of such award or any adjustment in compensation required by this chapter, and whose insurer failed, neglected, refused or is unable to pay the compensation, such compensation shall be paid from the Second Injury Fund. The administrative law judge, on a finding of failure or inability to pay compensation, shall give notice to the Treasurer of the award, directing the Treasurer to make payment from the fund. Whenever liability to pay compensation is contested by the Treasurer, the Treasurer shall file with the administrative law judge, on or before the twenty-eighth day after the Treasurer has received an order of payment from the administrative law judge, a notice in accordance with a form prescribed by the chairperson of the Workers' Compensation Commission stating that the right to compensation is contested, the name of the claimant, the name of the employer, the date of the alleged injury or death and the specific grounds on which the right to compensation is contested. A copy of the notice shall be sent to the employee. The administrative law judge shall hold a hearing on such contested liability at the request of the Treasurer or the employee in accordance with the provisions of this chapter. If the Treasurer fails to file the notice contesting liability within the time prescribed in this section, the Treasurer shall be conclusively presumed to have accepted the compensability of such alleged injury or death from the Second Injury Fund and shall have no right thereafter to contest the employee's right to receive compensation on any grounds or contest the extent of the employee's disability.\n\n(c) The employer and the insurer, if any, shall be liable to the state for any payments made out of the fund in accordance with this section or which the Treasurer has by award become obligated to make from the fund, together with cost of attorneys' fees as fixed by the court. If reimbursement is not made, or a plan for payment to the fund has not been agreed to by the Treasurer and employer, not later than ninety days after any payment from the fund, the Attorney General shall bring a civil action, in the superior court for the judicial district where the award was made, to recover all amounts paid by the fund pursuant to the award, plus double damages together with reasonable attorney's fees and costs as taxed by the court. Any amount paid to the Treasurer by the employer or insurer after the filing of an action, but prior to its completion, shall be subject to an interest charge of eighteen per cent per annum, calculated from the date of original payment from the fund.\n\n(d) Any recovery made under this section, including any recovery for costs or attorney's fees, shall be paid into the fund. Any administrative or other costs or expenses incurred by the Attorney General in connection with carrying out the purposes of this section, including the hiring of necessary employees, shall be paid from the fund. The Treasurer shall adopt regulations, in accordance with the provisions of chapter 54, which describe what constitutes a proper and sufficient “plan for payment to the fund” for the purposes of this section.\n\n(e) Notwithstanding the provisions of subsections (a) to (d), inclusive, of this section, whenever the employer's insurer has been determined to be insolvent, as defined in section 38a-838 , payments required under this section shall be the obligation of the Connecticut Insurance Guaranty Association pursuant to the provisions of sections 38a-836 to 38a-853 , inclusive.\n\n(f) Notwithstanding subsection (b) of this section, the administrative law judge may approve a stipulated settlement for benefits between an injured worker and the Treasurer under this chapter at any time prior to or after the issuance of a finding and award against the employer if the administrative law judge determines that it is in the best interest of the injured workers to do so. Notice of the proposed settlement shall be sent to the employer by certified mail, return receipt requested, to the employer's last-known address on file with the Secretary of the State or local postal authority. The administrative law judge shall hold a hearing on such proposed settlement at the request of the employer in accordance with the provisions of this chapter. If the employer does not file with the Workers' Compensation Commission a written objection to the proposed settlement not later than twenty-eight days after the date of the notice to the employer of the proposed settlement, the employer shall be deemed to have consented to the proposed settlement and may not thereafter contest the terms of the settlement in any forum. Where payment has been ordered under this subsection, the terms of such order shall have the same status and be governed by the same provisions as an award issued pursuant to subsection (b) of this section.\n\n(g) Nothing in this section shall preclude the Treasurer from entering into an agreement with the employer for the reimbursement of expenses, costs or benefits paid by the fund. The Treasurer, the uninsured employer, the injured worker, or the injured worker's beneficiaries, or a third party who is liable under section 31-293 may enter into a settlement agreement to finally or partially settle the rights and liabilities of any or all parties under this chapter, subject to the approval of the administrative law judge.\n\n(h) When a finding and award of compensation has been made against an uninsured employer who fails to pay it, that compensation shall be paid from the Second Injury Fund, and if there are further claims for any related, reasonable and necessary treatment, payment shall by provided to the claimant without a subsequent finding and award."

              "(a) In order to carry out the purposes of this chapter the commissioner, upon presenting appropriate credentials to the employer, is authorized (1) to enter without advance notice, except as provided in regulations adopted in accordance with chapter 54 and this chapter, and at reasonable times any factory, plant, establishment, construction site, or other area, work place or environment where work is performed by an employee of an employer, and (2) to inspect and investigate, during regular working hours and at other reasonable times and within reasonable limits and in a reasonable manner, any such place of employment and all pertinent conditions, structures, machines, apparatus, devices, equipment and the materials therein and to question, privately, any such employer or employee. Whenever the commissioner, proceeding pursuant to this section, is denied admission to any such place of employment, he shall obtain a warrant to make an inspection or investigation of such place of employment from any judge of the Superior Court. Any judge of the Superior Court within the state is authorized to issue a warrant pursuant to this section and shall issue such warrant whenever he is satisfied that the following conditions are met: That the individual seeking the warrant is a duly authorized agent of the department; and that such individual has established under oath or affirmation that the place of employment to be investigated in accordance with this section is to be inspected to determine compliance or noncompliance with a standard, regulation or order, or that there is probable cause to believe that there is a condition in or about such place of employment constituting a hazard to safety or health.",
              "(b) In making his inspections and investigations under this chapter, the commissioner may require the attendance and testimony of witnesses and the production of evidence under oath. Witnesses shall be paid the same fees and mileage that are paid witnesses in the courts of this state. In case of contumacy or failure or refusal of any person to obey such an order, the superior court for the judicial district wherein such person resides, is found or transacts business shall have jurisdiction to issue to such person an order requiring such person to appear to produce evidence if asked, and when so ordered, and to give testimony relating to the matter under investigation or in question. Any failure to obey such order of the court may be punished by the court as a contempt thereof.",
              "(c) (1) Each employer shall make, keep and preserve and make available to the commissioner and the United States Secretary of Labor such records regarding his activities relating to this chapter as the commissioner may prescribe in regulations adopted in accordance with chapter 54 and this chapter as necessary or appropriate for the enforcement of this chapter or for developing information regarding the causes and prevention of occupational accidents and illnesses. In order to carry out the provisions of this subdivision such regulations may include provisions requiring employers to conduct periodic inspections. The commissioner shall also adopt regulations in accordance with chapter 54 and this chapter requiring that employers through posting of notices or other appropriate means keep their employees informed of their protections and obligations under this chapter, including the provisions of applicable standards.",
              "(2) The commissioner shall adopt regulations in accordance with chapter 54 and this chapter requiring employers to maintain accurate records of and to make periodic reports on work-related deaths, injuries and illnesses other than minor injuries requiring only first aid treatment and which do not involve medical treatment, loss of consciousness, restriction of work or motion, or transfer to another job.",
              "(3) The commissioner shall adopt regulations in accordance with chapter 54 and this chapter requiring employers to maintain accurate records of employee exposures to potentially toxic materials or harmful physical agents which are required to be monitored or measured under any occupational safety and health standard adopted under this chapter. Such regulations shall provide employees or their representatives an opportunity to observe such monitoring or measuring and to have access to the records thereof. Such regulations shall also make appropriate provision for each employee or former employee to have access to such records as will indicate his own exposure to toxic materials or harmful physical agents. Each employer shall promptly notify any employee who has been or is being exposed to toxic materials or harmful physical agents in concentrations or at levels which exceed those prescribed by an applicable occupational safety and health standard promulgated in regulations adopted in accordance with chapter 54 and this chapter and shall inform any employee who is being thus exposed of the corrective action being taken.",
              "(d) Any information obtained by the commissioner under this chapter shall be obtained with a minimum burden upon employers. Unnecessary duplication of efforts in obtaining information shall be reduced to the maximum extent feasible.",
              "(e) Subject to regulations adopted by the commissioner in accordance with chapter 54 and this chapter, a representative of the employer and a representative authorized by the employees of the employer shall be given an opportunity to accompany the commissioner or his authorized representative during the physical inspection of any work place for the purpose of aiding such inspection. Where there is no authorized employee representative, the commissioner or his authorized representative shall consult with a reasonable number of employees concerning matters of health and safety in the work place.",
              "(f) (1) The commissioner may compile, analyze and publish in either summary or detail form all reports or information obtained under this section.",
              "(2) The commissioner shall adopt such regulations in accordance with chapter 54 and this chapter as he may deem necessary to carry out his responsibilities under this chapter, including regulations dealing with the inspection of an employer's or owner's establishment.",
              "(g) (1) In accordance with the provisions of section 4-38d , the duty of the Department of Public Health to license and to establish standards for health facilities operated by a commercial or industrial establishment for the care of its employees shall be transferred to the Division of Occupational Safety and Health of the Labor Department. No commercial or industrial establishment within the state shall establish, conduct, operate or maintain a health facility for its employees without a license as required by this subsection.",
              "(2) Application for such license shall be made to the Labor Department upon forms provided by it and shall contain such information as the department requires, which may include affirmative evidence of ability to comply with reasonable standards and regulations adopted pursuant to the provisions of this subsection. Upon receipt of an application for a license, the Labor Department shall issue such license if, upon inspection and investigation by the Division of Occupational Safety and Health, it finds that the applicant and facilities meet the requirements established by regulation. Such license shall be valid for one year or fraction thereof and shall terminate on March thirty-first, June thirtieth, September thirtieth or December thirty-first of each year. A license, unless sooner suspended or revoked, shall be renewable annually, without charge, upon the filing by the licensee, and approval by the Labor Department, of an annual report upon such date and containing such information in such form as the department prescribes and satisfactory evidence of continuing compliance with requirements. Each license shall be issued only for the premises and persons named in the application and shall not be transferable or assignable. Licenses shall be posted in a conspicuous place on the licensed premises.",
              "(3) The Labor Department shall adopt, in accordance with chapter 54 and this chapter, and enforce regulations for health facilities licensed under the provisions of this subsection in order to provide for reasonable standards of health, safety and comfort for the employees utilizing such facilities. The regulations adopted by the Labor Department shall conform to the standards established by this chapter.",
              "(4) The Labor Department, after reasonable notice and a hearing, may suspend, revoke or refuse to renew a license in any case in which it finds there has been a substantial failure to comply with the requirements established under this subsection. The requirements of reasonable notice and hearing, as provided for in this subsection, and appeals from the decisions of said department, shall comply with the requirements of chapter 54."

              "(2) “Essential employee” means any person employed in a category recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices as of February 20, 2021, to receive a COVID-19 vaccination in phase 1a, 1b or 1c of the COVID-19 vaccination program;",

              "(4) “Assistance” means moneys payable by the Comptroller from the Connecticut Essential Workers COVID-19 Assistance Fund, established pursuant to subsection (c) of this section, to assist affected persons pursuant to this section;",
              "(5) “Uncompensated leave” means the wages or salary lost by (A) an affected person unable to work as a result of contracting COVID-19, or due to symptoms that were later diagnosed as COVID-19, at any time during the public health and civil preparedness emergencies declared by the Governor on March 10, 2020, or any extension of such declarations; and",

The program shall offer assistance, within available funds and on a first-come, first-served basis, to affected persons eligible for assistance under this section, pending verification of eligibility, provided no assistance shall be paid to any affected person after June 30, 2024. The program shall be administered by the administrator. The administrator shall accept applications for assistance on or after October 1, 2021. For the purposes of this section, the administrator shall be authorized to (1) determine whether an affected person meets the requirements for eligibility for assistance under this section and the amount of assistance that should be provided; (2) summon and examine under oath such witnesses that may provide information relevant to the eligibility of an affected person, and direct the production of, and examine or cause to be produced or examined, such books, records, vouchers, memoranda, documents, letters, contracts or other papers in relation to any matter at issue as the administrator may find proper; and (3) take or cause to be taken affidavits or depositions within or without the state.",
              "(c) There is established an account to be known as the “Connecticut Essential Workers COVID-19 Assistance Fund” which shall be a separate, nonlapsing account within the General Fund.

Moneys in the account shall be expended by the Comptroller at the discretion of the administrator for the purposes of (1) assistance offered under the Connecticut Essential Workers COVID-19 Assistance Program, and (2) costs and expenses of operating the program, including the hiring of necessary employees and the expense of public outreach and education regarding the program and fund, provided not more than five per cent of the total moneys received by the fund shall be used for any administrative costs, including hiring temporary or durational staff or contracting with a third-party administrator, or other costs and expenses incurred by the administrator or Comptroller in connection with carrying out the provisions of this section and subsection (a) of section 31-306 . The administrator shall make all reasonable efforts to limit the costs and expenses of operating the program without compromising affected persons' access to the program.",
              "(d) To apply for assistance from the Connecticut Essential Workers COVID-19 Assistance Fund, an affected person with a pending workers' compensation claim under chapter 568, related to COVID-19, or an affected person who does not have such pending workers' compensation claim, shall submit a claim to the administrator, in such form as required by the administrator, not later than December 31, 2022. An affected person who does not have a pending workers' compensation claim related to COVID-19 shall submit a claim to the administrator, in such form as required by the administrator, not later than one year after the date such person was initially unable to work as a result of contracting COVID-19 or due to symptoms that were later diagnosed as COVID-19 or December 31, 2022, whichever is later. Any such claim shall include: (1) A certificate issued by a licensed medical professional documenting the laboratory test or diagnosis that such affected person contracted COVID-19 (A) requiring such person to isolate and quarantine from others, (B) preventing such affected person from performing such affected person's employment duties, or (C) requiring in-patient or outpatient medical treatment; (2) for the purposes of requesting assistance for uncompensated leave, evidence of (A) such affected person's weekly earnings during the eight calendar weeks immediately preceding the time of diagnosis, except in the case of an employee who has not yet worked for that employer for an eight-week period, for the time period such employee was employed, and (B) uncompensated leave due to the contraction of COVID-19 or symptoms that were later diagnosed as COVID-19; (3) for the purposes of requesting assistance for out-of-pocket costs for medical and surgical aid or hospital or nursing service, evidence of such affected person's costs; and (4) any additional information as requested or required by the administrator.",
              "(e) The level of assistance offered to an affected person shall be calculated as follows, subject to available funds, and payable on a retroactive basis from the date such person was initially unable to work as a result of contracting COVID-19 or due to symptoms that were later diagnosed as COVID-19, but not earlier than March 10, 2020, and not later than July 20, 2021: (1) Weekly assistance for all uncompensated leave, calculated as seventy-five per cent of such affected person's average weekly earnings during the eight calendar weeks immediately preceding the date such person was initially unable to work as a result of contracting COVID-19, or due to symptoms that were later diagnosed as COVID-19, except in the case of an employee who has not yet worked for that employer for an eight-week period, seventy-five per cent of such affected person's average weekly earnings for the time period such employee was employed, and after such earnings have been reduced by any deduction for: (A) Federal or state taxes, or both; (B) the federal Insurance Contributions Act, provided such assistance shall not exceed the average weekly earnings of all workers in the state as calculated by the Labor Commissioner, pursuant to section 31-309 ; and (C) any benefits received for total or partial unemployment as provided in chapter 567, any amount of temporary total or temporary partial disability benefits under chapter 568, and any amounts provided through a paid leave plan provided by an employer or pursuant to any state or federal law, for the same days of such claimed assistance; (2) all documented out-of-pocket COVID-19 related costs for medical and surgical aid or hospital and nursing service incurred directly as a result of such affected person contracting COVID-19, including, but not limited to, medical rehabilitation services, mental health therapy services and prescription drugs; and (3) burial expenses in the amount of three thousand dollars in any case in which an employee died due to contracting COVID-19 during (A) the public health and civil preparedness emergencies declared by the Governor on March 10, 2020, or any extension of such declarations, or (B) any new public health and civil preparedness emergencies declared by the Governor as a result of a COVID-19 outbreak in this state.",
              "(f) The administrator shall promptly review all claims submitted pursuant to this section. The administrator shall evaluate each claim and determine, on the basis of information provided by the affected person, or additional information provided at the request of the administrator, whether or not such claim should be approved and, if approved, the amount of assistance offered. The administrator shall provide such determination, in writing, to such affected person not later than sixty business days after having received the notice of claim, or, if the administrator requested additional information, not later than ten business days after receiving such additional information, and shall direct the Comptroller to pay any such assistance offered to such affected person in the amount and for the duration determined by the administrator, if applicable. If the administrator determines more information is needed from the affected person for the purpose of requesting assistance for uncompensated leave, out-of-pocket costs for medical and surgical aid or hospital or nursing service or burial expenses, the administrator may pay such affected person for the completed parts of their claim while the remainder of the claim is pending.",
              "(g) For purposes of this section, a pending workers' compensation claim submitted by an affected person shall not prevent the administrator from approving such person's claim for assistance under this section, provided any workers' compensation benefits such affected person receives for the workers' compensation claim shall be offset by the amount of assistance such affected person receives for uncompensated leave under this section, as deemed appropriate by the presiding administrative law judge. Any assistance available under this section shall be offset by any workers' compensation benefits already paid to the affected person for the uncompensated leave or out-of-pocket medical costs, including payments made without prejudice. It shall be the responsibility of the administrator of the fund to notify the Workers' Compensation Commission of an available offset.",
              "(h) For purposes of this section, a disability or unemployment claim submitted by an affected person or affected employee shall not prevent the administrator from approving such person's claim for assistance under this section, provided any assistance available under this section shall be offset by any disability or unemployment benefits already paid to the affected person for the uncompensated leave, including payments made without prejudice. If an affected person or affected employee received unemployment benefits pursuant to chapter 567, nothing in this section shall be construed to require such person to be currently employed with a previous employer in order to qualify for assistance from the fund.",
              "(i) An affected person may request that a determination made pursuant to subsection (f) of this section be reconsidered by the administrator's designee by filing a request with the administrator, on a form prescribed by the administrator, not later than twenty business days after the mailing of the notice of such determination. The administrator, not later than three business days after receipt of such request for reconsideration, shall designate an individual to conduct such reconsideration and shall submit to such designated individual all documents relating to such affected person's claim. The administrator's designee shall conduct any reconsideration requested by an affected person, which shall consist of a de novo review of all relevant evidence, not later than twenty business days after such individual's designation. Such administrator's designee shall issue such designee's decision affirming, modifying or reversing the decision of the administrator not later than twenty business days after the designee's reconsideration of the determination and shall submit such decision in writing to the administrator and the affected person. The decision shall include a short statement of findings that shall specify any assistance to be paid to the affected person in accordance with subsection (f) of this section.",
              "(j) Any statement, document, information or matter may be considered by the administrator or, on reconsideration, by the administrator's designee, if in the opinion of the administrator or designee, it contributes to a determination of the claim, whether or not the same would be admissible in a court of law.",
              "(k) There shall be no right of appeal by any affected person or affected employee claiming assistance under this section following the final decision of the administrator's designee issued pursuant to subsection (i) of this section.",
              "(l) Any assistance provided to an affected person under this section shall not be considered income for the purpose of the state's personal income tax law, corporation tax or any other tax laws.",
              "(m) If a claim is paid to an affected person erroneously or as a result of wilful misrepresentation by such affected person, the administrator may seek repayment of benefits from the affected person having received such compensation and may also, in the case of wilful misrepresentation, seek payment of a penalty in the amount of fifty per cent of the benefits paid as a result of such misrepresentation.",
              "(n) On or before January 1, 2022, and monthly thereafter, and any other time at the request of the administrator, the Comptroller shall submit a report to the administrator indicating the value of the Connecticut Essential Workers COVID-19 Assistance Fund at the time of the report.",
              "(o) On or before January 1, 2022, and at least quarterly thereafter, the administrator shall submit to the joint standing committee of the General Assembly having cognizance of matters relating to labor, in accordance with section 11-4a , a report on the financial condition of the Connecticut Essential Workers COVID-19 Assistance Fund. Such report shall include (1) an estimate of the fund's value as of the date of the report; (2) the effect of scheduled payments on the fund's value; (3) an estimate of the monthly administrative costs necessary to operate the program and the fund; and (4) any recommendations for legislation to improve the operation or administration of the program and the fund.",
              "(p) On or after May 7, 2022, the administrator shall review any previously denied, or currently pending, claim for assistance from the program and make a new determination of eligibility."

The program shall offer assistance, within available funds and on a first-come, first-served basis, to affected persons eligible for assistance under this section, pending verification of eligibility, provided no assistance shall be paid to any affected person after June 30, 2024. The program shall be administered by the administrator. The administrator shall accept applications for assistance on or after October 1, 2021. For the purposes of this section, the administrator shall be authorized to (1) determine whether an affected person meets the requirements for eligibility for assistance under this section and the amount of assistance that should be provided; (2) summon and examine under oath such witnesses that may provide information relevant to the eligibility of an affected person, and direct the production of, and examine or cause to be produced or examined, such books, records, vouchers, memoranda, documents, letters, contracts or other papers in relation to any matter at issue as the administrator may find proper; and (3) take or cause to be taken affidavits or depositions within or without the state.\n\n(c) There is established an account to be known as the “Connecticut Essential Workers COVID-19 Assistance Fund” which shall be a separate, nonlapsing account within the General Fund.

An affected person who does not have a pending workers' compensation claim related to COVID-19 shall submit a claim to the administrator, in such form as required by the administrator, not later than one year after the date such person was initially unable to work as a result of contracting COVID-19 or due to symptoms that were later diagnosed as COVID-19 or December 31, 2022, whichever is later. Any such claim shall include: (1) A certificate issued by a licensed medical professional documenting the laboratory test or diagnosis that such affected person contracted COVID-19 (A) requiring such person to isolate and quarantine from others, (B) preventing such affected person from performing such affected person's employment duties, or (C) requiring in-patient or outpatient medical treatment; (2) for the purposes of requesting assistance for uncompensated leave, evidence of (A) such affected person's weekly earnings during the eight calendar weeks immediately preceding the time of diagnosis, except in the case of an employee who has not yet worked for that employer for an eight-week period, for the time period such employee was employed, and (B) uncompensated leave due to the contraction of COVID-19 or symptoms that were later diagnosed as COVID-19; (3) for the purposes of requesting assistance for out-of-pocket costs for medical and surgical aid or hospital or nursing service, evidence of such affected person's costs; and (4) any additional information as requested or required by the administrator.\n\n(e) The level of assistance offered to an affected person shall be calculated as follows, subject to available funds, and payable on a retroactive basis from the date such person was initially unable to work as a result of contracting COVID-19 or due to symptoms that were later diagnosed as COVID-19, but not earlier than March 10, 2020, and not later than July 20, 2021: (1) Weekly assistance for all uncompensated leave, calculated as seventy-five per cent of such affected person's average weekly earnings during the eight calendar weeks immediately preceding the date such person was initially unable to work as a result of contracting COVID-19, or due to symptoms that were later diagnosed as COVID-19, except in the case of an employee who has not yet worked for that employer for an eight-week period, seventy-five per cent of such affected person's average weekly earnings for the time period such employee was employed, and after such earnings have been reduced by any deduction for: (A) Federal or state taxes, or both; (B) the federal Insurance Contributions Act, provided such assistance shall not exceed the average weekly earnings of all workers in the state as calculated by the Labor Commissioner, pursuant to section 31-309 ; and (C) any benefits received for total or partial unemployment as provided in chapter 567, any amount of temporary total or temporary partial disability benefits under chapter 568, and any amounts provided through a paid leave plan provided by an employer or pursuant to any state or federal law, for the same days of such claimed assistance; (2) all documented out-of-pocket COVID-19 related costs for medical and surgical aid or hospital and nursing service incurred directly as a result of such affected person contracting COVID-19, including, but not limited to, medical rehabilitation services, mental health therapy services and prescription drugs; and (3) burial expenses in the amount of three thousand dollars in any case in which an employee died due to contracting COVID-19 during (A) the public health and civil preparedness emergencies declared by the Governor on March 10, 2020, or any extension of such declarations, or (B) any new public health and civil preparedness emergencies declared by the Governor as a result of a COVID-19 outbreak in this state.\n\n(f) The administrator shall promptly review all claims submitted pursuant to this section. The administrator shall evaluate each claim and determine, on the basis of information provided by the affected person, or additional information provided at the request of the administrator, whether or not such claim should be approved and, if approved, the amount of assistance offered. The administrator shall provide such determination, in writing, to such affected person not later than sixty business days after having received the notice of claim, or, if the administrator requested additional information, not later than ten business days after receiving such additional information, and shall direct the Comptroller to pay any such assistance offered to such affected person in the amount and for the duration determined by the administrator, if applicable. If the administrator determines more information is needed from the affected person for the purpose of requesting assistance for uncompensated leave, out-of-pocket costs for medical and surgical aid or hospital or nursing service or burial expenses, the administrator may pay such affected person for the completed parts of their claim while the remainder of the claim is pending.\n\n(g) For purposes of this section, a pending workers' compensation claim submitted by an affected person shall not prevent the administrator from approving such person's claim for assistance under this section, provided any workers' compensation benefits such affected person receives for the workers' compensation claim shall be offset by the amount of assistance such affected person receives for uncompensated leave under this section, as deemed appropriate by the presiding administrative law judge. Any assistance available under this section shall be offset by any workers' compensation benefits already paid to the affected person for the uncompensated leave or out-of-pocket medical costs, including payments made without prejudice. It shall be the responsibility of the administrator of the fund to notify the Workers' Compensation Commission of an available offset.\n\n(h) For purposes of this section, a disability or unemployment claim submitted by an affected person or affected employee shall not prevent the administrator from approving such person's claim for assistance under this section, provided any assistance available under this section shall be offset by any disability or unemployment benefits already paid to the affected person for the uncompensated leave, including payments made without prejudice. If an affected person or affected employee received unemployment benefits pursuant to chapter 567, nothing in this section shall be construed to require such person to be currently employed with a previous employer in order to qualify for assistance from the fund.\n\n(i) An affected person may request that a determination made pursuant to subsection (f) of this section be reconsidered by the administrator's designee by filing a request with the administrator, on a form prescribed by the administrator, not later than twenty business days after the mailing of the notice of such determination. The administrator, not later than three business days after receipt of such request for reconsideration, shall designate an individual to conduct such reconsideration and shall submit to such designated individual all documents relating to such affected person's claim. The administrator's designee shall conduct any reconsideration requested by an affected person, which shall consist of a de novo review of all relevant evidence, not later than twenty business days after such individual's designation. Such administrator's designee shall issue such designee's decision affirming, modifying or reversing the decision of the administrator not later than twenty business days after the designee's reconsideration of the determination and shall submit such decision in writing to the administrator and the affected person. The decision shall include a short statement of findings that shall specify any assistance to be paid to the affected person in accordance with subsection (f) of this section.\n\n(j) Any statement, document, information or matter may be considered by the administrator or, on reconsideration, by the administrator's designee, if in the opinion of the administrator or designee, it contributes to a determination of the claim, whether or not the same would be admissible in a court of law.\n\n(k) There shall be no right of appeal by any affected person or affected employee claiming assistance under this section following the final decision of the administrator's designee issued pursuant to subsection (i) of this section.\n\n(l) Any assistance provided to an affected person under this section shall not be considered income for the purpose of the state's personal income tax law, corporation tax or any other tax laws.\n\n(m) If a claim is paid to an affected person erroneously or as a result of wilful misrepresentation by such affected person, the administrator may seek repayment of benefits from the affected person having received such compensation and may also, in the case of wilful misrepresentation, seek payment of a penalty in the amount of fifty per cent of the benefits paid as a result of such misrepresentation.\n\n(n) On or before January 1, 2022, and monthly thereafter, and any other time at the request of the administrator, the Comptroller shall submit a report to the administrator indicating the value of the Connecticut Essential Workers COVID-19 Assistance Fund at the time of the report.\n\n(o) On or before January 1, 2022, and at least quarterly thereafter, the administrator shall submit to the joint standing committee of the General Assembly having cognizance of matters relating to labor, in accordance with section 11-4a , a report on the financial condition of the Connecticut Essential Workers COVID-19 Assistance Fund. Such report shall include (1) an estimate of the fund's value as of the date of the report; (2) the effect of scheduled payments on the fund's value; (3) an estimate of the monthly administrative costs necessary to operate the program and the fund; and (4) any recommendations for legislation to improve the operation or administration of the program and the fund.\n\n(p) On or after May 7, 2022, the administrator shall review any previously denied, or currently pending, claim for assistance from the program and make a new determination of eligibility."

Any person, including an employer, who intentionally aids, abets, assists, promotes or facilitates the making of, or the attempt to make, any claim for payment or the receipt or attempted receipt of payment by another person in violation of this subsection shall be liable for the same financial penalty as the person making, or attempting to make, such claim or receiving, or attempting to receive, benefits from the program.\n\n(j) On or before July 31, 2022, and monthly thereafter, and any other time at the request of the administrator, the Comptroller shall submit a report to the administrator indicating the value of the Connecticut premium pay account at the time of the report.\n\n(k) On or before September 1, 2022, and at least quarterly thereafter, the administrator shall submit a report, in accordance with the provisions of section 11-4a , to the joint standing committee of the General Assembly having cognizance of matters relating to labor on the financial condition of the Connecticut premium pay account. Such report shall include: (1) An estimate of the account's value as of the date of the report; (2) the effect of scheduled payments on the account's value; (3) an estimate of the monthly administrative costs necessary to operate the program and the account; and (4) any recommendations for legislation to improve the operation or administration of the program and the account."
