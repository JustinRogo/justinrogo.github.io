Defendants' breaches of their fiduciary duty to plaintiff entitled plaintiff to damages, including reimbursement of any improper fees and charges, interest for loss of use of profits and a constructive trust over profits defendants received through improper use of partnership funds, and constituted a violation of CUTPA because defendants' actions clearly placed them in direct competition with the interests of the partnership. 57 CA 121. Where use and occupancy of apartment incidental to employment and not a tenancy, plaintiff could not prevail under CUTPA claim. 59 CA 704. Plaintiff, who established that defendant refused to sell and install carpeting at price originally quoted to plaintiff, suffered the loss of his contract and, therefore, sustained an “ascertainable loss” as result of an unfair trade practice; accordingly, plaintiff was entitled to punitive damages under CUTPA. 76 CA 586. Defendants did not violate CUTPA; trial court's assessment of dispute as intracorporate and outside purview of CUTPA was not clearly erroneous. 91 CA 619. Where both parties honored the contract, there was no unfair, unethical or unscrupulous act so as to constitute an unfair trade practice. 117 CA 550. Hospital has no duty, and public policy concerns do not support imposition of a duty, to report incident of alleged sexual crime against patient to patient's daughter before hospital has reasonable time to investigate allegations, and hospital's failure to report the incident before such time cannot form the basis of a CUTPA violation. 142 CA 72.

Award of attorney's fees improper because allegations in CUTPA count, even if taken as true, were insufficient on their face to state a cause of action under CUTPA because plaintiffs failed to present evidence at hearing in damages to support a claim beyond a mere breach of contract. 149 CA 267. Plaintiffs' claim of emotional distress, i.e. the loss of a reasonable expectation that the patient would be safe from harm and that the hospital would properly care for her, does not constitute an ascertainable loss of money or property as required for a CUTPA claim.

Plaintiff who purchased computer with preinstalled software from a retailer cannot recover from software manufacturer because plaintiff's claimed injuries are too indirect and remote from the manufacturer's allegedly anticompetitive conduct. 260 C. 59. In absence of any evidence of substantial injury to consumers or to plaintiff, the existence of exclusivity provisions between defendant newspaper and comic strip syndicators does not constitute probable cause to believe that defendant has violated CUTPA since such provisions are customary in the newspaper industry, procompetitive and presumptively legal. 261 C. 673. Record supported trial court's finding that defendants' actions did not constitute a CUTPA violation, notwithstanding their unworkmanlike construction of plaintiff's home. 295 C. 214. Contractor who is owner and president of business entity can be held individually liable for unfair and unscrupulous conduct on behalf of entity. 317 C. 565. Insurance company practice of requiring staff motor vehicle physical damage appraisers to use hourly labor rates agreed on by the insurance company and auto body shops not an unfair trade practice; Regulation of Connecticut State Agencies requiring appraisers to approach appraisal of damaged property without prejudice against or favoritism toward any party did not prohibit such insurance company practices.

Discussed re res judicata and federal litigation. 49 CA 582. Single act of misconduct is sufficient to support a CUTPA claim; federal law sets a floor, not a ceiling. 72 CA 342. With respect to CUTPA, clear and convincing evidence is not the appropriate standard of proof whenever claims of tortious conduct require proof of willful, wrongful or unlawful acts; the ordinary preponderance of the evidence standard is appropriate. 99 CA 719. A landlord-tenant relationship can be the basis for a CUTPA claim, but there must be some nexus with a public interest, some violation of a concept of what is fair, some immoral, unethical, oppressive or unscrupulous business practice or some practice that offends public policy. 126 CA 829. Defendant's theft of plaintiff's funds constituted conversion and theft, and court properly found such act qualified as immoral, unethical, oppressive and unscrupulous and therefore constituted an unfair or deceptive act proscribed by CUTPA. 136 CA 99. Negligent misrepresentations, if accompanied by one or more sufficient aggravating factors, suffice for recovery of damages pursuant to CUTPA. 156 CA 750. Violation of section established where record evidence showed knowing and intentional filing of manifestly excessive mechanic's lien primarily for an improper purpose and defendant suffered an ascertainable loss in responding to the mechanic's lien. 157 CA 139."

Although purely intracorporate conflicts are not covered by CUTPA, actions outside scope of the employment relationship may be covered. Id., 355. Defendant did not engage in deceptive practice prohibited by CUTPA by intentionally failing to disclose until after fall catalogs were printed and mailed that it did not intend to provide financing for deferred billing program; since courts have held that a failure to disclose can be deceptive only if, in light of all the circumstances, there is a duty to disclose, the letter of intent, under facts of the case, did not give rise to any statutory, regulatory or contractual duty on defendant's part to repudiate timely its commitment to provide financing for deferred billing program. 274 C. 33.

While existence of a duty is not a prerequisite for finding of a CUTPA violation, defendant did not violate CUTPA by declining to do that which it simply was not required to do. 64 CA 417. Failure to disclose can be deceptive only if, in light of all the circumstances, there is a duty to disclose. 78 CA 760. Representing on numerous occasions that work will be performed by one subcontractor known to perform at a certain master level while knowing that the work will be performed by a different subcontractor not of the same master level constitutes a deceptive act. 113 CA 509. A practice may be unfair because of the degree to which it meets one of the following criteria or because to a lesser extent it meets all three: (1) Whether the practice, without necessarily having been previously considered unlawful, offends public policy as it has been established by statutes, common law or otherwise; (2) whether it is immoral, unethical, oppressive or unscrupulous; or (3) whether it causes substantial injury to consumers, competitors or other businesspersons. 114 CA 262. A CUTPA violation may not be alleged for activities that are incidental to an entity's primary trade or commerce, and subject transaction was incidental to primary business and thus fell outside purview of CUTPA. 116 CA 483. Contractor's failure to obtain certificate of registration under Sec. 20-417b and not disclosing that fact to plaintiff was a CUTPA violation as a matter of law, but plaintiff failed to show that the violation resulted in an ascertainable loss. 121 CA 165. Allegations involving purely intracorporate matters fail to satisfy CUTPA's requirement that a defendant's conduct implicate trade or commerce. 123 CA 512. Defendant land owner's conduct, in inducing plaintiff land purchaser to pursue design plans and the purchase of land after the original term of their reservation agreement had expired then increasing the price of the land in contravention of that agreement, deprived plaintiff of the benefit of his bargain and was unscrupulous and unethical and thus constituted a deceptive and unfair trade practice. Id., 800. Under CUTPA, general principles of agency law are applicable to determine whether to hold a principal liable for the acts of its agent, and trial court properly imputed to defendant the acts of its attorney and real estate agent for purpose of establishing a CUTPA violation. 125 CA 678. CUTPA is inapplicable in case where sellers of real property were not primarily engaged in the business of selling real property. 132 CA 272. CUTPA is inapplicable in malpractice actions against accountants, except in cases relating to the commercial or entrepreneurial aspects of an accounting practice. 142 CA 684. Court need not pierce corporate veil or find a corporate officer committed fraud to determine officer personally violated CUTPA via direct participation in tortious conduct; although CUTPA is primarily a statutory cause of action, it is equally recognized that CUTPA claims may arise from underlying causes of action, such as contract violations or torts. 144 CA 241; judgment affirmed in part, see 317 C. 565. Defendant violated public policy behind federal Truth-in-Lending Act, 15 USC 1601 et seq., and engaged in unfair or deceptive acts or practices prohibited by CUTPA, by failing to disclose financing terms before requiring payment of substantial nonrefundable deposit. 174 CA 649.

The commissioner or the commissioner's authorized representatives shall have power to require by subpoena the attendance and testimony of witnesses and the production of all such documentary material relating to any matter under investigation.\n\n(c) In addition to other powers conferred upon the commissioner, said commissioner may execute in writing and cause to be served, through reasonable efforts to effectuate notice as set forth in section 21a-2 , an investigative demand upon any person suspected of using, having used or about to use any method, act or practice declared by section 42-110b to be unlawful or upon any person from whom said commissioner wants assurance that section 42-110b has not, is not or will not be violated. Such investigative demand shall contain a description of the method, act or practice under investigation, provide a reasonable time for compliance, and require such person to furnish under oath or otherwise, as may be specified in said demand, a report in writing setting forth relevant facts or circumstances together with documentary material. Notwithstanding subsection (f) of this section, responses to investigative demands issued under this subsection may be withheld from public disclosure during the full pendency of the investigation.\n\n(d) Said commissioner, in conformance with sections 4-176e to 4-185 , inclusive, whenever the commissioner has reason to believe that any person has been engaged or is engaged in an alleged violation of any provision of this chapter, shall deliver to such person, in a manner that is sufficient to effectuate notice as set forth in section 21a-2 , a complaint stating the charges and containing a notice of a hearing, to be held upon a day and at a place therein fixed at least fifteen days after the date of such complaint. The person so notified shall have the right to file a written answer to the complaint and charges therein stated and appear at the time and place so fixed for such hearing, in person or otherwise, with or without counsel, and submit testimony and be fully heard. Any person may make application, and upon good cause shown shall be allowed by the commissioner to intervene and appear in such proceeding by counsel or in person. The testimony in any such proceeding, including the testimony of any intervening person, shall be under oath and shall either be reduced to writing by the recording officer of the hearing or recorded in an audio or audiovisual format. The commissioner or the commissioner's authorized representatives shall have the power to require by subpoena the attendance and testimony of witnesses and the production of any documentary material at such proceeding. If upon such hearing the commissioner is of the opinion that the method of competition or the act or practice in question is prohibited by this chapter, the commissioner or the commissioner's designee shall make a report in writing to the person complained of in which the commissioner or such designee shall state the commissioner's or such designee's findings as to the facts and shall forward by certified mail to such person an order to cease and desist from using such methods of competition or such act or practice. The commissioner may impose a civil penalty, in an amount not to exceed the amount set forth in subsection (b) of section 42-110o , after a hearing conducted pursuant to chapter 54, or, if the amount involved is less than ten thousand dollars, an order directing restitution, or both. The commissioner may apply for the enforcement of any cease and desist order, civil penalty, order directing restitution or consent order issued or imposed under this chapter to the superior court for the judicial district of Hartford, or to any judge thereof if the same is not in session, for an order temporarily or permanently restraining and enjoining any person from continuing any violation of such cease and desist order, an order directing payment of any civil penalty or restitution or a consent order. Such application for a temporary restraining order, temporary and permanent injunction, order directing payment of any civil penalty or restitution and for such other appropriate decree or process shall be brought and the proceedings thereon conducted by the Attorney General.\n\n(e) In addition to any injunction issued pursuant to subsection (d) of this section, the court may make such additional orders or judgments as may be necessary to restore to any person in interest any moneys or property, real or personal, which may have been acquired by means of any practices prohibited by this chapter, including the appointment of a receiver or the revocation of a license or certificate authorizing the person subject to the order or injunction to engage in business in this state, or both.\n\n(f) The commissioner or the Attorney General or their employees shall disclose, in accordance with the provisions of the Freedom of Information Act, as defined in section 1-200 , all records concerning the investigation of any alleged violation of any provision of this chapter, including, but not limited to, any complaint initiating an investigation and all records of the disposition or settlement of a complaint. For purposes of this section, “disposition” shall include the following action or nonaction with respect to any complaints or investigations: (1) No action taken because of (A) a lack of jurisdiction, (B) unsubstantiated allegations, or (C) a lack of sufficient information to draw a conclusion, as determined by the commissioner, after investigation; (2) referral to another state agency, or to a federal or local agency, or to law enforcement authorities; (3) an acceptance of an assurance of voluntary compliance in accordance with the provisions of section 42-110j ; and (4) formal action taken, including the institution of administrative proceedings pursuant to subsection (d) of this section or court proceedings pursuant to section 42-110m , 42-110o or 42-110p . The commissioner may withhold such records from disclosure during the pendency of an investigation or examination held in accordance with subsection (a) of this section, but in no event shall the commissioner withhold any such records longer than a period of eighteen months after the date on which the initial complaint was filed with the commissioner or after the date on which the investigation or examination was commenced, whichever is earlier. Nothing herein shall be deemed to affect the rights of litigants, including parties to administrative proceedings, under the laws of discovery of this state."

A party must establish that the conduct constitutes an unfair or deceptive trade practice and must present evidence providing court with basis for a reasonable estimate of the damages suffered; once a violation of CUTPA has been established, evidence that defendant has acted with reckless indifference to plaintiff's rights or has committed an intentional and wanton violation of those rights is a necessary prerequisite to award of punitive damages; such an award is discretionary and the exercise of such discretion will not ordinarily be interfered with on appeal unless the abuse is manifest or injustice appears to have been done; with respect to CUTPA, clear and convincing evidence is not the appropriate standard of proof whenever claims of tortious conduct require proof of willful, wrongful or unlawful acts; the ordinary preponderance of the evidence standard is appropriate. 99 CA 719. Court did not abuse its discretion in awarding attorney's fees under CUTPA, including fees for work done on post-trial motions. 121 CA 105. By not objecting to plaintiff's submission of a statement of attorney's fees or the content of that statement, defendant acquiesced in that request and will not be heard to complain about that request on appeal. 130 CA 286.

Single act of misconduct is sufficient to support CUTPA claim; proof of an ascertainable loss does not require quantification of the loss that claimant has suffered. 72 CA 342. Subsec. allows recovery only when the party seeking to recover damages establishes that conduct at issue constitutes an unfair or deceptive trade practice and presents evidence providing court with basis for reasonable estimate of the damages suffered. 99 CA 645. The statements of a party during litigation and a disagreement over the terms of a note do not cause the type of ascertainable loss required by CUTPA. 131 CA 223. CUTPA does not require plaintiff to prove that the ascertainable loss was incurred in this state when plaintiff alleges injury caused by unfair trade practices committed by defendants in this state. Id., 443. Trial court properly concluded that plaintiff suffered ascertainable loss of money because defendant's offer to apply plaintiff's deposit as store credit did not make plaintiff's money freely available to plaintiff. 174 CA 649. The ascertainable loss requirement is a threshold barrier which limits the class of persons who may bring a CUPTA action seeking either actual damages or equitable relief, thus, punitive damages and attorney's fees, which are potential remedies available to a plaintiff once he meets this threshold barrier and prevails on his CUPTA claim, cannot be the basis of demonstrating ascertainable loss; plaintiff's claim of emotional distress does not constitute an ascertainable loss of money or property for purposes of CUPTA. 188 CA 153."

(a); Subsec. does not contain a presumption in favor of attorney's fees; use of the test for awarding punitive damages- intentional, wanton, malicious, or evil conduct- as the test for awarding attorney's fees is improper as it is too demanding and undermines the legislative intent because it neither enhances the private CUPTA remedy nor encourages private CUPTA litigation. 337 C. 589."

              "(a) As used in this section: (1) “Trading stamp” means any stamp or similar device issued in connection with the retail sale of merchandise or service, as a cash discount or for any other marketing purpose, which entitles the rightful holder, on its presentation for redemption, to receive merchandise, service or cash. “Trading stamp” shall not mean any redeemable device used by the manufacturer or packer of an article, in advertising or selling it, or any redeemable device issued and redeemed by a newspaper, magazine or other publication; (2) “trading stamp company” means any person engaged in distributing trading stamps for retail issuance by others, or in redeeming trading stamps for retailers, in any manner; and (3) “person” means any individual, partnership, corporation, limited liability company, association or other organization.",
              "(b) No trading stamp company shall distribute or redeem trading stamps issued after October 1, 1959, in this state unless (1) each stamp has legibly printed upon its face in cents or any fraction thereof a cash value determined by the company and (2) the holders may, at their option, redeem the stamps in cash when duly presented to the company for redemption in a number having an aggregate cash value of not less than twenty-five cents.",
              "(c) No trading stamp company shall distribute trading stamps in this state or shall redeem trading stamps issued after October 1, 1959, therein until it has, on or before January first annually, paid to the Secretary of the State a license fee of one per cent of the principal sum of the bond required to be filed under subdivision (2) of this subsection and has filed with said secretary: (1) A statement of registration accompanied by representative samples of its stamps, stamp collection books, stamp redemption catalogs and stamp distribution and redemption agreement forms, currently used in this state. Each such statement shall provide the following information: (A) The name and principal address of the company; (B) the state of its incorporation or origin; (C) the names and addresses of its principal officers, partners or proprietors; (D) the address of its principal office in this state; (E) the name and address of its principal officer, employee or agent therein; (F) the addresses of the places where its stamps are redeemable therein; (G) a short form of its balance sheet as of the end of its last fiscal year prior to such filing, certified by an independent public accountant; and (H) unless the principal sum of the bond required by subdivision (2) of this subsection to be filed by the company is the maximum amount required under subsection (d), a statement of its gross income from its business in this state as a trading stamp company during such last fiscal year, certified by an independent public accountant; and (2) a bond payable to this state and executed by the company and a corporate surety qualified to do business in this state, which is conditioned upon the performance by the company of its obligation to redeem trading stamps issued by retailers in this state, when they are presented for redemption by the rightful holders. Each trading stamp company shall notify the Secretary of the State of any change in the addresses of the places where its stamps are redeemable in this state within ten days of any such change. If the company defaults in performing such obligations, all rightful holders of trading stamps of such company, including retailers in possession of such stamps for issuance to customers, shall be entitled to make claim against said bond. Any such holder may, within three months after such default, file a complaint with the Secretary of the State, who shall forthwith make a determination whether there has been a default. If said secretary determines that there has been such a default, he shall give notice of such determination to the company and, if such default is not corrected within ten days, he shall publish notice of such default in three consecutive publications of one or more newspapers having general circulation throughout this state and therein require that proof of all claims for redemption of the trading stamps of such company be filed with him, together with the trading stamps upon which the claim is based, within three months after the date of the first such publication. Said secretary promptly after the expiration of such period shall determine the validity of all claims so filed. Thereupon said secretary shall be paid by the surety such amount, not exceeding in the aggregate the principal sum of the bond, as is necessary to satisfy all valid claims so filed together with reasonable administrative expenses incident to the determination and payment of such claims. Said secretary shall promptly thereafter make an equitable distribution of the proceeds of the bond, less such reasonable administrative expenses, to such claimants and shall destroy the trading stamps so surrendered. If the amount paid by the surety is not sufficient to satisfy in full all valid claims and administrative expenses, the secretary may bring an action in a court of competent jurisdiction against the trading stamp company to recover, on behalf of the claimants, the difference between the aggregate value of such claims, including such administrative expenses, and the amount paid by the surety.",
              "(d) The principal sum of the bond to be filed shall be as follows: If the company has not previously done business as a trading stamp company in this state, or if the company's gross income from such business in this state during its last fiscal year was not in excess of two hundred and fifty thousand dollars, thirty-five thousand dollars; if such gross income exceeded two hundred and fifty thousand dollars but did not exceed five hundred thousand dollars, fifty thousand dollars; if such gross income exceeded five hundred thousand dollars but was not in excess of seven hundred and fifty thousand dollars, seventy-five thousand dollars; and if such gross income exceeded seven hundred and fifty thousand dollars, one hundred thousand dollars. On the effective date of each new bond, any and all liability on all bonds previously filed under the provision of subsection (c) shall terminate, and all rightful holders of trading stamps who prosecute their claims under said subsection shall prosecute such claims solely against the new bond and only by filing proofs of claim with the Secretary of the State in the manner provided in said subsection.",
              "(e) No trading stamp company shall cease or suspend the redemption of trading stamps in this state without filing with the Secretary of the State at least ninety days' prior written notice of its intention so to do and concurrently mailing a copy of such notice to each retailer within this state which has at any time theretofore within one year issued trading stamps which the company is obligated to redeem.",
              "(f) Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (b), a trading stamp company may redeem trading stamps if issued within the state prior to October 1, 1959, notwithstanding the fact that any such trading stamp does not have legibly printed upon its face in cents or any fraction thereof a cash value as determined by such trading stamp company.",
              "(g) No person shall issue to his customers in connection with the sale of merchandise any trading stamp, coupon or similar device which has previously been issued in such connection by any other person responsible for the redemption thereof, unless the consent of the latter has been first obtained.",
              "(h) The Secretary of the State shall investigate compliance with this section and shall notify the Attorney General of any violations of which he may have knowledge. Any trading stamp company which violates any provision of this section shall be fined not more than one thousand dollars, and the Superior Court shall have jurisdiction in equity on the complaint of any interested person to restrain and enjoin the violation of any of said provisions."

              "(a) The legislature of the state of Connecticut finds and declares that the distribution and sales of gasoline and petroleum products through franchises within the state of Connecticut, including the rights and obligations of suppliers and dealers, vitally affects its general economy. In order to promote the public interest and public welfare, to avoid undue control of the dealer by suppliers, to foster and keep alive vigorous and healthy competition for the benefit of the public by prohibiting practices through which fair and honest competition is destroyed or prevented, to promote the public safety, to prevent deterioration of facilities for servicing motor vehicles on the highways of the state, to prevent dealers from unnecessarily going out of business thereby resulting in unemployment with loss of tax revenue to the state and its resultant undesirable consequences, and to offset evident abuses within the petroleum industry as a result of inequitable economic power, it is necessary to legislate standards pursuant to the exercise of the police power of this state governing the relationship between suppliers and distributors of gasoline and petroleum products and the dealers within the state who sell those products to the public.",
              "(b) In recognition of the factors set forth in subsection (a) of this section, it is provided that all provisions of sections 42-133j to 42-133n , inclusive, to the extent permitted by law, shall be deemed effective as to those presently existing franchise agreements involving gasoline dealers within the state of Connecticut as of October 1, 1977.",
              "(c) The legislature further finds and declares that the distribution and sales of motor vehicle fuels and oils in the state of Connecticut affects the general economy of the state, the public interest and the public welfare. Competition, freedom from unreasonable restraints on alienation and competitive pricing are essential to the functioning of a fair and efficient free market economy within the petroleum industry. The legislature finds and declares that existing petroleum franchise agreements as defined and regulated within sections 42-133e to 42-133h , inclusive, uniformly prohibit assignment of franchise interests without the consent of the franchisor, which consent may be unreasonably and arbitrarily withheld. Also, existing petroleum franchise agreements provide for their automatic termination upon the death of the franchisee. The legislature finds and declares that such provisions constitute unreasonable restraints on alienation and inhibit the fair and efficient functioning of a free market economy within the petroleum industry. Therefore, it is provided that the provisions of any franchise agreement which prohibit assignment without the consent of the franchisor and permit such consent to be unreasonably withheld are void and without effect as contrary to public policy. It is further provided that the provisions of any franchise agreement which terminate the franchise automatically upon the death of the franchisee are void and ineffective as contrary to public policy. The legislature finds and declares that provisions in certain existing petroleum franchise agreements prohibit gasoline retailers or distributors from offering a discount to a buyer based upon the method of payment by such buyer for gasoline. The legislature finds and declares that such provisions constitute unreasonable restraints on competitive pricing and inhibit the fair and efficient functioning of a free market economy within the petroleum industry. Therefore, it is provided that the provisions of any franchise agreement that prohibit gasoline retailers or distributors from offering a discount to a buyer based upon the method of payment by such buyer for gasoline are void and without effect as contrary to public policy."

            "text": "(a) The legislature of the state of Connecticut finds and declares that the distribution and sales of gasoline and petroleum products through franchises within the state of Connecticut, including the rights and obligations of suppliers and dealers, vitally affects its general economy. In order to promote the public interest and public welfare, to avoid undue control of the dealer by suppliers, to foster and keep alive vigorous and healthy competition for the benefit of the public by prohibiting practices through which fair and honest competition is destroyed or prevented, to promote the public safety, to prevent deterioration of facilities for servicing motor vehicles on the highways of the state, to prevent dealers from unnecessarily going out of business thereby resulting in unemployment with loss of tax revenue to the state and its resultant undesirable consequences, and to offset evident abuses within the petroleum industry as a result of inequitable economic power, it is necessary to legislate standards pursuant to the exercise of the police power of this state governing the relationship between suppliers and distributors of gasoline and petroleum products and the dealers within the state who sell those products to the public.\n\n(b) In recognition of the factors set forth in subsection (a) of this section, it is provided that all provisions of sections 42-133j to 42-133n , inclusive, to the extent permitted by law, shall be deemed effective as to those presently existing franchise agreements involving gasoline dealers within the state of Connecticut as of October 1, 1977.\n\n(c) The legislature further finds and declares that the distribution and sales of motor vehicle fuels and oils in the state of Connecticut affects the general economy of the state, the public interest and the public welfare. Competition, freedom from unreasonable restraints on alienation and competitive pricing are essential to the functioning of a fair and efficient free market economy within the petroleum industry. The legislature finds and declares that existing petroleum franchise agreements as defined and regulated within sections 42-133e to 42-133h , inclusive, uniformly prohibit assignment of franchise interests without the consent of the franchisor, which consent may be unreasonably and arbitrarily withheld. Also, existing petroleum franchise agreements provide for their automatic termination upon the death of the franchisee. The legislature finds and declares that such provisions constitute unreasonable restraints on alienation and inhibit the fair and efficient functioning of a free market economy within the petroleum industry. Therefore, it is provided that the provisions of any franchise agreement which prohibit assignment without the consent of the franchisor and permit such consent to be unreasonably withheld are void and without effect as contrary to public policy. It is further provided that the provisions of any franchise agreement which terminate the franchise automatically upon the death of the franchisee are void and ineffective as contrary to public policy. The legislature finds and declares that provisions in certain existing petroleum franchise agreements prohibit gasoline retailers or distributors from offering a discount to a buyer based upon the method of payment by such buyer for gasoline. The legislature finds and declares that such provisions constitute unreasonable restraints on competitive pricing and inhibit the fair and efficient functioning of a free market economy within the petroleum industry. Therefore, it is provided that the provisions of any franchise agreement that prohibit gasoline retailers or distributors from offering a discount to a buyer based upon the method of payment by such buyer for gasoline are void and without effect as contrary to public policy."

A dealer may not declare an average percentage markup or average labor rate more than twice in one calendar year.\n\n(g) A manufacturer or distributor may not otherwise recover its costs from dealers within this state, including an increase in the wholesale price of a vehicle or surcharge imposed on a dealer solely intended to recover the cost of reimbursing a dealer for parts and labor pursuant to this section, provided a manufacturer or distributor shall not be prohibited from increasing prices for vehicles or parts in the normal course of business.\n\n(h) Time allowances for the diagnosis and performance of warranty work and service shall be reasonable and adequate for the work to be performed.\n\n(i) Each manufacturer or distributor shall perform all warranty obligations, include in written notices of factory recalls to owners and dealers the expected date by which necessary parts and equipment will be available to dealers for the correction of such defects and compensate dealers for repairs necessitated by such recall.\n\n(j) All claims by dealers under this section for such labor and parts and all claims for compensation relative to any sales incentive, marketing and advertising programs shall be paid not later than thirty days after approval by the manufacturer or distributor, provided manufacturers or distributors retain the right to audit such claims and to charge-back the dealer for false or unsubstantiated claims for a period of one year following payment. A manufacturer or distributor shall not deny a claim submitted under this subsection or charge-back such a claim or payment following a timely audit based solely on the dealer's failure to comply with a claim processing procedure, a clerical error or other administrative technicality, provided such failure does not call into question the legitimacy of the claim. The manufacturer or distributor shall allow the dealer to resubmit such claim according to reasonable manufacturer or distributor guidelines not later than thirty days after the initial claim denial or charge-back. If there is evidence of fraud, the provisions of this subsection shall not limit the right of a manufacturer or distributor to audit a dealer for longer periods of time and charge-back the dealer for any fraudulent claim. Dealers shall be required to maintain defective parts for a period of not longer than ninety days following submission of claims. All such claims shall be either approved or disapproved not later than thirty days after their receipt on forms, and in the manner specified by, the manufacturer or distributor. Any claim not disapproved in writing or by means of electronic transmission not later than thirty days after receipt shall be deemed approved and payment shall be made within thirty days."

              "(b) Each payment requisition submitted by a contractor or subcontractor in accordance with the requirements of subsection (a) of this section shall include a statement showing the status of all pending construction change orders, other pending change directives and approved changes to the original contract or subcontract. Such statement shall identify the pending construction change orders and other pending change directives, and shall include the date such change orders and directives were initiated, the costs associated with their performance and a description of any work completed.

              "(c) No consumer shall be required to notify the manufacturer of a claim under this section and sections 42-181 to 42-184 , inclusive, unless the manufacturer has clearly and conspicuously disclosed to the consumer, in the warranty or owner's manual, that written notification of the nonconformity is required before the consumer may be eligible for a refund or replacement of the vehicle. The manufacturer shall include with the warranty or owner's manual the name and address to which the consumer shall send such written notification.",

              "(2) For the purposes of this subsection, incidental damages include, but are not limited to, compensation for any commercially reasonable charges or expenses with respect to: (A) Inspection, receipt, transportation, care or custody of the motor vehicle; (B) covering, returning or disposing of the motor vehicle; (C) reasonable efforts to minimize or avoid the consequences of financial default related to the motor vehicle; and (D) effectuating other remedies after a defect or condition that substantially impaired the motor vehicle has been reported to a dealership or manufacturer.",

Refunds or replacements shall be made to the consumer, lessor and lienholder if any, as their interests may appear.

              "(a) The Department of Consumer Protection shall provide an independent arbitration procedure for the settlement of disputes between consumers and manufacturers of motor vehicles which do not conform to all applicable warranties under the terms of section 42-179 . The Commissioner of Consumer Protection shall appoint as arbitrators individuals who shall not be employees or independent contractors with any business involved in the manufacture, distribution, sale or service of any motor vehicle. The arbitrator shall be a member of an arbitration organization and shall serve with compensation. The Department of Consumer Protection may refer an arbitration dispute to the American Arbitration Association or other arbitration organization in accordance with regulations adopted in accordance with the provisions of chapter 54, provided such organization and any arbitrators appointed by such organization to hear cases shall not be affiliated with any motor vehicle manufacturer, distributor, dealer or repairer. Such arbitration organizations shall comply with the provisions of subsections (b) and (d) of this section.",
              "(b) If any motor vehicle purchased at any time on or after October 1, 1984, or leased at any time on or after June 17, 1987, fails to conform to such applicable warranties as defined in section 42-179 , a consumer may bring a grievance to an arbitrator if the manufacturer of the vehicle has not established an informal dispute settlement procedure which the Attorney General has certified as complying in all respects with the requirements of section 42-179 . The consumer may initiate a request for arbitration by calling a toll-free telephone number designated by the commissioner or by requesting an arbitration hearing in writing. The consumer shall file, on forms prescribed by the commissioner, any information deemed relevant to the resolution of the dispute and shall return the form accompanied by a filing fee of fifty dollars. Prior to submitting the complaint to an arbitrator, the Department of Consumer Protection shall conduct an initial review of the complaint. The department shall determine whether the complaint should be accepted or rejected for arbitration based on whether it alleges that the manufacturer has failed to comply with section 42-179 . The filing fee shall be refunded if the department determines that a complaint does not allege a violation of any applicable warranty under the requirements of section 42-179 . Upon acceptance of the complaint, the commissioner shall notify the manufacturer of the filing of a request for arbitration and shall obtain from the manufacturer, in writing on a form prescribed by the commissioner, any information deemed relevant to the resolution of the dispute. The manufacturer shall return the form within fifteen days of receipt, together with a filing fee of two hundred fifty dollars. Upon written agreement of the parties, signed after the consumer has initiated a request for arbitration, the case may be presented to the arbitrator solely based on the written documents submitted by such parties. A lessee who brings a grievance to an arbitrator under this section shall, upon filing the complaint form provided for in this section, provide the lessor with notice by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, and the lessor may petition the arbitrator to be made a party to the arbitration proceedings. Initial determinations to reject a complaint for arbitration shall be submitted to an arbitrator for a final decision upon receipt of a written request from the consumer for a review of the initial eligibility determination and a filing fee of fifty dollars. If a complaint is accepted for arbitration, an arbitrator may determine that a complaint does not allege that the manufacturer has failed to comply with section 42-179 at any time before such arbitrator renders its decision on the merits of the dispute. The fee accompanying the consumer's complaint form shall be refunded to the consumer and the fee accompanying the form filed by the manufacturer shall be refunded to the manufacturer if the arbitrator determines that a complaint does not allege a violation of the provisions of section 42-179 .",
              "(c) After a consumer submits the forms and fee pursuant to subsection (b) of this section and until such time that a decision or settlement is rendered, the consumer shall notify any individual or entity to whom he or she sells the motor vehicle that an action is pending with the department pursuant to this section. Such notice shall be given prior to the buyer's execution of the bill of sale, and shall include any case number or reference number provided by the department to the consumer. The consumer shall (1) notify the department not later than five days after the buyer's execution of the bill of sale that the motor vehicle has been sold, (2) provide the department with the name and contact information of the buyer, and (3) attest that notice of the pending action was given to the buyer prior to the buyer's execution of the bill of sale.",
              "(d) The Department of Consumer Protection shall investigate, gather and organize all information necessary for a fair and timely decision in each dispute. The commissioner may issue subpoenas on behalf of any arbitrator to compel the attendance of witnesses and the production of documents, papers and records relevant to the dispute. The department shall forward a copy of all written testimony, including all documentary evidence, to an independent technical expert certified by the National Institute of Automotive Service Excellence or having a degree or other credentials from a nationally recognized organization or institution attesting to automotive expertise, who shall review such material and be available to advise and consult with the arbitrator. An arbitrator shall, as expeditiously as possible, but not later than sixty days after the time the consumer files the complaint form together with the filing fee, render a fair decision based on the information gathered and disclose his or her findings and the reasons therefor to the parties involved. The failure of the arbitrator to render a decision within sixty days shall not void any subsequent decision or otherwise limit the powers of the arbitrator. The arbitrator shall base his or her determination of liability solely on whether the manufacturer has failed to comply with section 42-179 . The arbitration decision shall be final and binding as to the rights of the parties pursuant to section 42-179 , subject only to judicial review as set forth in this subsection. The decision shall provide appropriate remedies, including, but not limited to, one or more of the following:",
              "(1) Replacement of the vehicle with an identical or comparable new vehicle acceptable to the consumer;",
              "(2) Refund of the full contract price, plus collateral charges as specified in subsection (d) of section 42-179 ;",
              "(3) Reimbursement for expenses and compensation for incidental damages as specified in subsection (d) of section 42-179 ;",
              "(4) Any other remedies available under the applicable warranties, section 42-179 , this section and sections 42-182 to 42-184 , inclusive, or the Magnuson-Moss Warranty-Federal Trade Commission Improvement Act, 88 Stat. 2183 (1975), 15 USC 2301 et seq., as in effect on October 1, 1982, other than repair of the vehicle. The decision shall specify a date for performance and completion of all awarded remedies.",
              "(e) Notwithstanding any provision of the general statutes, the Department of Consumer Protection shall not amend, reverse, rescind or revoke any decision or action of an arbitrator. The department shall contact the consumer, not later than ten business days after the date for performance, to determine whether performance has occurred. The manufacturer shall act in good faith in abiding by any arbitration decision. In addition, either party to the arbitration may apply to the superior court for the judicial district in which one of the parties resides or, when the court is not in session, any judge thereof for an order confirming, vacating, modifying or correcting any award, in accordance with the provisions of this section and sections 52-417 , 52-418 , 52-419 and 52-420 . Upon filing such application, the moving party shall mail a copy of the application to the Attorney General and, upon entry of any judgment or decree, shall mail a copy of such judgment or decree to the Attorney General. A review of such application shall be confined to the record of the proceedings before the arbitrator. The court shall conduct a de novo review of the questions of law raised in the application. In addition to the grounds set forth in sections 52-418 and 52-419 , the court shall consider questions of fact raised in the application. In reviewing questions of fact, the court shall uphold the award unless it determines that the factual findings of the arbitrator are not supported by substantial evidence in the record and that the substantial rights of the moving party have been prejudiced. If the arbitrator fails to state findings or reasons for the award, or the stated findings or reasons are inadequate, the court shall search the record to determine whether a basis exists to uphold the award. If it is determined by the court that the manufacturer has acted without good cause in bringing an appeal of an award, the court, in its discretion, may grant to the consumer his costs and reasonable attorney's fees. If the manufacturer fails to perform all awarded remedies by the date for performance specified by the arbitrator, and the enforcement of the award has not been stayed pursuant to subsection (c) of section 52-420 , then each additional day the manufacturer wilfully fails to comply shall be deemed a separate violation for purposes of section 42-184 . If the manufacturer fails to perform regarding all awarded remedies by the applicable date of performance specified by the arbitrator, and enforcement of the award has not been stayed pursuant to subsection (c) of section 52-240 or otherwise modified by the arbitrator, the department may impose a fine not to exceed one thousand dollars per day until the manufacturer fully performs as specified by the award. Any such fines shall be deposited into the new automobile warranties account established pursuant to section 42-190 . A manufacturer that is aggrieved by a fine imposed pursuant to this subsection may, not later than ten days of receipt of written notice of such fine from the department, request, in writing, a hearing. The department shall, upon the receipt of all documentation necessary to evaluate the request, determine whether circumstances beyond the manufacturer's control prevented performance, and may conduct a hearing pursuant to chapter 54, if appropriate.",
              "(f) The department shall maintain such records of each dispute as the commissioner may require, including an index of disputes by brand name and model. The department shall annually compile and maintain statistics indicating the record of manufacturer compliance with arbitration decisions and the number of refunds or replacements awarded. A copy of the statistical summary shall be filed with the Commissioner of Motor Vehicles and shall be considered a factor in determining the issuance of any manufacturer license as required under section 14-67a . The summary shall be a public record.",
              "(g) If a manufacturer has not established an informal dispute settlement procedure certified by the Attorney General as complying with the requirements of section 42-179 , public notice of the availability of the department's automobile dispute settlement procedure shall be prominently posted in the place of business of each new car dealer licensed by the Department of Motor Vehicles to engage in the sale of such manufacturer's new motor vehicles. Display of such public notice shall be a condition of licensure under sections 14-52 and 14-64 . The Commissioner of Consumer Protection shall determine the size, type face, form and wording of the sign required by this section, which shall include the toll-free telephone number and the address to which requests for the department's arbitration services may be sent.",
              "(h) Any consumer injured by the operation of any procedure which does not conform with procedures established by a manufacturer pursuant to subsection (b) of section 42-182 and the provisions of Title 16 Code of Federal Regulations Part 703, as in effect on October 1, 1982, may appeal any decision rendered as the result of such a procedure by requesting arbitration de novo of the dispute by an arbitrator. Filing procedures and fees for appeals shall be the same as those required in subsection (b) of this section. The findings of the manufacturer's informal dispute settlement procedure may be admissible in evidence at such arbitration and in any civil action subsequently arising out of any warranty obligation or matter related to the dispute. Any consumer so injured may, in addition, request the Attorney General to investigate the manufacturer's procedure to determine whether its certification shall be suspended or revoked after proper notice and hearing. The Attorney General shall establish procedures for processing such consumer complaints and maintain a record of the disposition of such complaints, which record shall be included in the annual report prepared in accordance with the provisions of subsection (a) of section 42-182 .",
              "(i) The Commissioner of Consumer Protection shall adopt regulations, in accordance with the provisions of chapter 54, to carry out the purposes of this section. Written copies of the regulations and appropriate arbitration hearing procedures shall be provided to any person upon request."
