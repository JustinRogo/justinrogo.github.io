He shall maintain the state standards in good order and shall provide for their certification as prescribed by the National Institute of Standards and Technology at least once in ten years. He shall, at least once in two years, test by the state standards all standard weights, measures and other apparatus which belong to any municipality and shall seal such apparatus as is found to be accurate, by stamping thereon, with seals kept for that purpose, the letter “C” and the last two figures of the year of certification. He shall have general supervision of the weights, measures and weighing and measuring devices sold, offered for sale or used in the state. He, or the inspectors by his direction, shall, at least once in each year, test all scales, weights and measures used in checking the receipt or disbursement of supplies in each institution for the maintenance of which moneys are appropriated by the General Assembly, and he shall maintain a record of his findings and make such record available to the supervisory board and to the executive officer of the institution concerned, and, at the request of such board or executive officer, he shall appoint, in writing, one or more employees, in the service of each institution, who shall act as special deputies for the purpose of checking the receipt or disbursement of supplies. He shall keep a complete record of the standards, balances and other apparatus belonging to the state, and take a receipt for the same from his successor in office. He, or the inspectors at his direction, shall, at least once in two years, inspect the work of the local sealers throughout the state and shall have power to inspect and ascertain the correctness of all weights, scales, beams, measures, instruments or mechanical devices for measuring, and tools, appliances or accessories connected with any such instruments or measures kept, offered or exposed for sale, sold, used or employed by any proprietor, agent, lessee or employee in proving the size, quantity, extent, area or measurement of quantities, things, produce or articles for distribution or consumption, offered or submitted by such person or persons for sale, hire or reward; and shall, from time to time, weigh or measure packages or amounts of commodities of any kind kept for the purpose of sale, offered for sale or sold, or in the process of delivery, in order to determine whether the same contain the amounts represented, and whether they are offered for sale or sold in accordance with law.

Said commissioner or the inspectors may seal any such weighing or measuring instrument or apparatus which is found to be correct and may seize and destroy any incorrect weight, measure or weighing or measuring instrument. The commissioner shall issue, from time to time, regulations prescribing specifications and tolerances for commercial weights and measures and weighing and measuring devices and regulations for the guidance of municipal sealers, which regulations shall govern the procedure to be followed by such officers in the discharge of their duties.

The clerk or comptroller of each municipality required by this section to appoint a sealer shall, upon notification and request by the Commissioner of Weights and Measures, reimburse the state for the cost of such services rendered. Municipal sealers of weights and measures shall perform the same duties and have the same powers within their jurisdiction as are vested in the Commissioner of Weights and Measures for the state except those powers and duties exempted and reserved to the Commissioner of Weights and Measures by regulation promulgated under the provisions of section 43-3 .

When the net weight of such thread, in or on any such unit, is less than two avoirdupois ounces, such unit shall be marked to show the length of such thread in yards as unwound from the unit. Ready-wound bobbins which are not sold separately shall not be required to be individually marked, but the package containing such bobbins shall be marked to show the number of bobbins contained therein and the net weight or measure of the thread on each bobbin. Any two or more similar individual units of thread, sold only for household use and not sold separately, which are contained in a single package shall not be required to be individually marked but such package shall be marked to show the number of individual units in such package and the net weight or measure of the thread in each individual unit, unless such individual units are separately marked. The markings required by this section shall, in all cases, be in combination with the name and place of business of the manufacturer or distributor of the thread, or with a trademark, symbol, brand or other mark which positively identifies such manufacturer or distributor and which shall be filed with the Commissioner of Weights and Measures. The net content of any such unit of thread shall be determined by ascertaining the average net weight or yardage of not less than ten units of thread of the same type and of the same kind of unit, selected at random from such units kept for the purpose of sale, sold, exposed or offered for sale. Such average net weight or yardage shall not be more than three per cent less than the weight or yardage marked on such units or the package containing such units. Regulations for the enforcement of the provisions of this section shall be issued by the Commissioner of Weights and Measures. The provisions of this section shall not apply to wool or to textile products made in whole or in part of wool. Any person who, by himself, his employee or agent, or as the employee or agent of another, violates any of the provisions of this section shall be subject to the penalties provided for in section 43-9 ."
