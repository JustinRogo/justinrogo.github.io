              "(b) A child or youth voluntarily admitted to the department shall be deemed to be within the care of the commissioner until such admission is terminated. The commissioner shall terminate the admission of any child or youth voluntarily admitted to the department within ten days after receipt of a written request for termination from a parent or guardian of any child under fourteen years of age or from a child if such child is fourteen years of age or older, or youth, unless prior to the expiration of that time the commissioner has sought and received from the Superior Court an order of temporary custody as provided by law.

Any child or youth admitted voluntarily to the department may be placed in, or transferred to, any resource, facility or institution within the department or available to the commissioner, provided the commissioner shall give written notice to such child or youth and to the parent or guardian of the child of the commissioner's intention to make a transfer at least ten days prior to any actual transfer, unless written notice is waived by those entitled to receive it, or unless an emergency commitment of such child or youth is made pursuant to section 17a-502 . Any child or youth admitted voluntarily to the department may be transferred to the supervision of the Department of Mental Health and Addiction Services or the Department of Developmental Services, in collaboration with the commissioner of the department to which the child is transferred. The Commissioner of Children and Families shall provide written notice of his or her intention to make a transfer at least ten days prior to any actual transfer to a child fourteen years of age or older, or youth, and to the parent or guardian of the child or youth being transferred. If the department has previously filed a petition with the Probate Court under subsection (c) of this section, the commissioner shall provide notice of such petition to the court. The Commissioner of Children and Families may continue to provide services to the child or youth in collaboration with the department to which the child or youth has been transferred or may terminate the voluntary services if, in the commissioner's discretion, the department to which the child or youth has been transferred provides adequate services. The commissioner shall provide written notice of his or her intention to terminate services following a transfer to another department to a child fourteen years of age or older, or youth, and to the parent or guardian of such child or youth.

A case service plan shall be required for all children and youths receiving services voluntarily from the department who are not in an out-of-home placement. A permanency plan shall be required for all children and youths voluntarily admitted to the department and placed by the department in a foster home licensed pursuant to section 17a-114 or a facility licensed pursuant to section 17a-145 . Upon receipt of such petition, the court shall set a time and place for a hearing to be held within thirty days of receipt of the petition, unless continued by the court for cause shown. The court shall order notice of the hearing to be given by first class mail at least five days prior to the hearing to the Commissioner of Children and Families, and by first class mail at least five days prior to the hearing to the parents or guardian of the child or youth and the child, if such child is fourteen years of age or older, or youth. If the whereabouts of the parent or guardian are unknown, or if delivery cannot reasonably be effected, then notice shall be ordered to be given by publication.

The court may conduct a hearing on its own motion to review the case service plan for a child or youth who is not in an out-of-home placement if the court determines that imminent concerns regarding the health and safety of the child or youth require a hearing. The court shall provide notice of the time and place of the hearing on such motion to the commissioner, the parents or guardian of the child or youth and to the child, if such child is fourteen years of age or older, or youth, not later than ten days prior to the date of such hearing. In making its determination as to whether there is an appropriate case service plan, the court shall consider the items specified in subdivision (2) of this subsection.",

The health and safety of the child or youth shall be of paramount concern in formulating such plan. At such hearing, the court shall consider among other things: (A) The appropriateness of the department's plan for service to the child or youth and his or her family; (B) the treatment and support services that have been offered and provided to the child or youth to strengthen the family; and (C) any further efforts which have been or will be made to promote the best interests of the child or youth. At the conclusion of the hearing, the court may: (i) Direct that the services being provided be continued if the court determines that continuation of the child or youth in services is in the child's or youth's best interests, or (ii) direct that the child's or youth's services be modified to reflect the child's or youth's best interest.",

A hearing on such motion shall be held not later than thirty days after the filing of such motion. Not later than ten days prior to the date of such hearing, the court shall provide notice to the commissioner, the parents or guardian of the child or youth and to the child, if such child is fourteen years of age or older, or youth, of the time and place of such hearing. In making its determination as to whether there is an appropriate permanency plan in place, the court shall consider the items specified in subsection (f) of this section.",
              "(f) (1) At a hearing to review a permanency plan for a child or youth who is placed in a foster home licensed pursuant to section 17a-114 or facility licensed pursuant to section 17a-145 , the court shall approve a permanency plan that is in the best interests of the child or youth and takes into consideration the child's or youth's need for permanency.

Application for voluntary admission shall be made in writing by the parent or guardian of a child under fourteen years of age or by such person himself or herself if he or she is a child fourteen years of age or older or a youth. The fact that a parent has applied for services or received services for his or her child through voluntary admission shall not be used against the parent (1) in any investigation conducted by the department in accordance with section 17a-101g , (2) when making placement decisions for the child, (3) when making foster care licensing determinations in accordance with section 17a-114 , or (4) in any court proceeding related to the placement of a minor relative of the parent.\n\n(b) A child or youth voluntarily admitted to the department shall be deemed to be within the care of the commissioner until such admission is terminated. The commissioner shall terminate the admission of any child or youth voluntarily admitted to the department within ten days after receipt of a written request for termination from a parent or guardian of any child under fourteen years of age or from a child if such child is fourteen years of age or older, or youth, unless prior to the expiration of that time the commissioner has sought and received from the Superior Court an order of temporary custody as provided by law. Except as provided in subsection (i) of this section, the commissioner may terminate the admission of any child or youth voluntarily admitted to the department after (1) giving reasonable notice in writing to (A) the parent or guardian of any child or youth, and (B) the child, if such child is fourteen years of age or older, or youth, and (2) if the commissioner has previously petitioned the Probate Court pursuant to subsection (c) of this section, providing notice to the Probate Court of such petition. Any child or youth admitted voluntarily to the department may be placed in, or transferred to, any resource, facility or institution within the department or available to the commissioner, provided the commissioner shall give written notice to such child or youth and to the parent or guardian of the child of the commissioner's intention to make a transfer at least ten days prior to any actual transfer, unless written notice is waived by those entitled to receive it, or unless an emergency commitment of such child or youth is made pursuant to section 17a-502 . Any child or youth admitted voluntarily to the department may be transferred to the supervision of the Department of Mental Health and Addiction Services or the Department of Developmental Services, in collaboration with the commissioner of the department to which the child is transferred. The Commissioner of Children and Families shall provide written notice of his or her intention to make a transfer at least ten days prior to any actual transfer to a child fourteen years of age or older, or youth, and to the parent or guardian of the child or youth being transferred. If the department has previously filed a petition with the Probate Court under subsection (c) of this section, the commissioner shall provide notice of such petition to the court. The Commissioner of Children and Families may continue to provide services to the child or youth in collaboration with the department to which the child or youth has been transferred or may terminate the voluntary services if, in the commissioner's discretion, the department to which the child or youth has been transferred provides adequate services. The commissioner shall provide written notice of his or her intention to terminate services following a transfer to another department to a child fourteen years of age or older, or youth, and to the parent or guardian of such child or youth. If the department has previously filed a petition with the Probate Court under subsection (c) of this section, the commissioner shall provide notice of such petition to the court.\n\n(c) Not more than one hundred twenty days after admitting a child or youth on a voluntary basis, the commissioner shall petition the Probate Court for the district in which a parent or guardian of the child or youth resides for a determination as to whether continuation of care is in the child's or youth's best interest and, if so, whether there is an appropriate case service or permanency plan in place for such child or youth. A case service plan shall be required for all children and youths receiving services voluntarily from the department who are not in an out-of-home placement. A permanency plan shall be required for all children and youths voluntarily admitted to the department and placed by the department in a foster home licensed pursuant to section 17a-114 or a facility licensed pursuant to section 17a-145 . Upon receipt of such petition, the court shall set a time and place for a hearing to be held within thirty days of receipt of the petition, unless continued by the court for cause shown. The court shall order notice of the hearing to be given by first class mail at least five days prior to the hearing to the Commissioner of Children and Families, and by first class mail at least five days prior to the hearing to the parents or guardian of the child or youth and the child, if such child is fourteen years of age or older, or youth. If the whereabouts of the parent or guardian are unknown, or if delivery cannot reasonably be effected, then notice shall be ordered to be given by publication. In making its determination as to whether there is an appropriate case service plan for a child or youth, the court shall consider the items specified in subdivision (2) of subsection (d) of this section. In making its determination as to whether there is an appropriate permanency plan for a child or youth, the court shall consider the items specified in subsection (f) of this section. The court shall possess continuing jurisdiction in proceedings under this section.\n\n(d) (1) If the child or youth is not in an out-of-home placement, the commissioner shall not be required to file periodic motions for review of the case service plan, provided the court shall conduct a hearing to review the case service plan on motion of the commissioner, a parent or guardian of the child or youth or a child fourteen years of age or older, or youth. The court may conduct a hearing on its own motion to review the case service plan for a child or youth who is not in an out-of-home placement if the court determines that imminent concerns regarding the health and safety of the child or youth require a hearing. The court shall provide notice of the time and place of the hearing on such motion to the commissioner, the parents or guardian of the child or youth and to the child, if such child is fourteen years of age or older, or youth, not later than ten days prior to the date of such hearing.

A hearing on such motion shall be held not later than thirty days after the filing of such motion. Not later than ten days prior to the date of such hearing, the court shall provide notice to the commissioner, the parents or guardian of the child or youth and to the child, if such child is fourteen years of age or older, or youth, of the time and place of such hearing. In making its determination as to whether there is an appropriate permanency plan in place, the court shall consider the items specified in subsection (f) of this section.\n\n(f) (1) At a hearing to review a permanency plan for a child or youth who is placed in a foster home licensed pursuant to section 17a-114 or facility licensed pursuant to section 17a-145 , the court shall approve a permanency plan that is in the best interests of the child or youth and takes into consideration the child's or youth's need for permanency. The health and safety of the child or youth shall be of paramount concern in formulating such plan. At such hearing, the court shall consider among other things: (A) The appropriateness of the department's plan for service to the child or youth and his or her family; (B) the treatment and support services that have been offered and provided to the child or youth to strengthen and reunite the family; (C) if return home is not likely for the child or youth, the efforts that have been made or should be made to evaluate and plan for other modes of care; and (D) any further efforts that have been or will be made to promote the best interests of the child or youth.\n\n(2) The permanency plan may include the goal of (A) placement of the child or youth with the parent or guardian, (B) transfer of guardianship, (C) termination of parental rights and adoption, or (D) for a youth, such other planned permanent living arrangement ordered by the court, provided the commissioner has documented a compelling reason why it would not be in the best interest of the youth for the permanency plan to include the goals in subparagraphs (A) to (C), inclusive, of this subdivision. Such other planned permanent living arrangement may include, but not be limited to, placement of a youth in an independent living program or long-term foster care with an identified foster parent.\n\n(3) At a hearing on a motion to review a permanency plan, the court shall review the status of the child or youth and the progress being made to implement the permanency plan, determine a timetable for attaining the permanency prescribed by the plan and determine whether the commissioner has made reasonable efforts to achieve the permanency plan. At the conclusion of the hearing, the court may: (A) Direct that the services being provided, or the placement of the child or youth and reunification efforts, be continued if the court, after hearing, determines that continuation of the child or youth in services or placement is in the child's or youth's best interests, or (B) direct that the child's or youth's services or placement be modified to reflect the child's or youth's best interest.\n\n(4) If the permanency plan for a youth includes the goal of such other planned permanent living arrangement pursuant to subparagraph (D) of subdivision (2) of this subsection, the department shall document for the court: (A) The manner and frequency of efforts made by the department to return the youth home or to secure placement for the youth with a fit and willing relative, legal guardian or adoptive parent; and (B) the steps the department has taken to ensure (i) the youth's foster family home or child care institution is following a reasonable and prudent parent standard, as defined in section 17a-114d ; and (ii) the youth has regular opportunities to engage in age appropriate and developmentally appropriate activities, as defined in section 17a-114d .\n\n(5) If the permanency plan for a youth includes the goal of such other planned permanent living arrangement pursuant to subparagraph (D) of subdivision (2) of this subsection, the court shall (A) (i) ask the youth about his or her desired permanency outcome, or (ii) if the youth is unavailable to appear at a hearing held in accordance with the provisions of subdivision (1) of this subsection, require the attorney for the youth to consult with the youth regarding the youth's desired permanency outcome and report the same to the court; (B) make a judicial determination that, as of the date of hearing, such other planned permanent living arrangement is the best permanency plan for the youth; and (C) document the compelling reasons why it is not in the best interest of the youth to return home or to be placed with a fit and willing relative, legal guardian or adoptive parent.\n\n(g) The commissioner shall adopt regulations in accordance with chapter 54 concerning (1) applications for voluntary admission, (2) the grant or denial of services, (3) informal administrative case review, and (4) termination of voluntary admission.\n\n(h) Any person aggrieved by a decision of the commissioner denying voluntary services may appeal such decision through an administrative hearing held pursuant to chapter 54.\n\n(i) Any parent or guardian of a child or youth, or any child fourteen years of age or older, who is aggrieved by a termination of admission pursuant to subsection (b) of this section may (1) request an administrative hearing in accordance with the regulations adopted by the commissioner pursuant to subsection (g) of this section, or (2) request a hearing before the Probate Court.

The investigation shall also include, but not be limited to, a review of criminal conviction information concerning the person or persons alleged to be responsible for such abuse or neglect and previous allegations of abuse or neglect relating to the child or other children residing in the household or relating to family violence. After an investigation into a report of abuse or neglect has been completed, the commissioner shall determine, based upon a standard of reasonable cause, whether a child has been abused or neglected, as defined in section 46b-120 .

Services provided through family assessment response shall include an array of community-based services and supports designed to meet the individual needs of families, build upon their strengths, enhance child development, reduce child abuse and neglect and increase the health, safety and well-being of children.",
              "(2) In response to an accepted family assessment report, the department shall conduct a comprehensive family assessment that shall include a safety and risk assessment and an assessment of family strengths and needs. Such assessment shall include personal interviews with the child and the child's parent or primary caretaker, an evaluation of the home environment and the performance of criminal background checks on all adults residing in the same household. Such assessment may include, as appropriate, personal interviews with other children or adults residing in the same household as well as any other caregivers, family members and collateral contacts. In conducting such assessment, the department shall consider the age and vulnerability of the child, family functioning, family history of abuse and neglect and family history of involvement with the department. The department shall, upon securing any necessary releases, request any relevant out-of-state history of child abuse or neglect involving any adults residing in the same household.",
              "(3) The following reports of suspected child abuse or neglect shall not be referred for family assessment response: (A) Sexual abuse, (B) abuse or neglect occurring in an out-of-home placement, (C) abuse or neglect resulting in the death or serious physical or mental injury of a child, or (D) where the department's safety assessment reveals that the child is unsafe. A case supervisor or manager shall approve all referrals to family assessment response.",
              "(4) Prior to referring a report to an appropriate community provider, the department shall develop a service plan designed to meet the family's immediate needs for services and supports and to guide the community provider's development of a long-term plan of care for the family.",
              "(5) Following a referral pursuant to subdivision (1) of this subsection, a community provider shall schedule an in-person meeting with the family and shall develop a plan of care. Such plan of care shall be developed in consultation with the family and shall include (A) a review of the department's family assessment and service plan and any services and supports the family is currently receiving, and (B) an identification of the family's ongoing needs and the services and supports that may be available to meet such needs. Such plan of care shall identify the family's strengths and needs and describe the services and supports to be offered to (i) address the family's needs, (ii) build upon the family's strengths, and (iii) increase the health, safety and well-being of the child. The provider shall monitor the family's participation and progress with the plan of care.",
              "(6) The community provider shall maintain ongoing contact with the family through in-person meetings, visits to the home, child and family team meetings and phone calls. If at any time following the referral or during the implementation of the plan of care, the provider has reasonable cause to suspect or believe that any child under eighteen years of age (A) has been abused or neglected, as defined in section 46b-120 , (B) has suffered a nonaccidental physical injury or an injury that is at variance with the history given for such injury, or (C) is placed at imminent risk of serious harm, the provider shall report or cause a report to be made in accordance with the provisions of sections 17a-101b to 17a-101d , inclusive.",
              "(7) The community provider shall schedule an in-person meeting with the family prior to the end of services. The determination to end services shall be based upon the family's preference and progress in meeting the goals outlined in the plan of care. The community provider shall submit individual child and family specific data and administrative service data to the department not later than thirty days after ending services. Such data shall identify the needs of the family, the services and supports made available to address those needs, the family's met and unmet treatment goals, the final disposition at the time of ending services and the reasons for the family's discharge from services, including, but not limited to, met treatment goals, family relocation, the receipt of a new report by the department or transfer of the family to another provider.",
              "(8) Subdivisions (5) to (7), inclusive, of this subsection shall apply to all community provider service contracts in effect on June 9, 2016, to the extent they are not in conflict with such contracts, and shall apply to all contracts entered into, amended, extended or renewed on or after June 9, 2016.",

If the report contains sufficient information to warrant an investigation, the commissioner shall make the commissioner's best efforts to commence an investigation of a report concerning an imminent risk of physical harm to a child or other emergency within two hours of receipt of the report and shall commence an investigation of all other reports within seventy-two hours of receipt of the report. A report classified by the commissioner, or the commissioner's designee, as lower risk may be referred for family assessment and services pursuant to subsection (g) of this section. Any such report may thereafter be referred for standard child protective services if safety concerns for the child become evident. A report referred for standard child protective services may be referred for family assessment and services at any time if the department determines there is a lower risk to the child. If the alleged perpetrator is a school employee, as defined in section 53a-65 , or is employed by an institution or facility licensed or approved by the state to provide care for children, the department shall notify the Department of Education or the state agency that has issued such license or approval to the institution or facility of the report and the commencement of an investigation by the Commissioner of Children and Families. The department shall complete any such investigation not later than thirty-three business days after the date of receipt of the report. If the report is a report of child abuse or neglect in which the alleged perpetrator is not a person specified in subdivision (1), (2) or (3) of this subsection, the Commissioner of Children and Families shall refer the report to the appropriate local law enforcement authority for the town in which the child resides or in which the alleged abuse or neglect occurred.\n\n(b) The Commissioner of Children and Families shall establish protocols for the investigation of and response to reports of child abuse or neglect of children from birth to three years of age. Such protocols shall include, but need not be limited to, (1) appropriate supervision of the case, (2) appropriate visitation by department personnel to such children, (3) documentation of case activities relevant to the safety and well-being of such children, and (4) a case supervision tool specific to the unique needs and risk status of children from birth to three years of age. All investigations of a report of child abuse or neglect pursuant to this section shall include a home visit at which the child and any siblings are observed, if appropriate, a determination of the nature, extent and cause or causes of the reported abuse or neglect, a determination of the person or persons suspected to be responsible for such abuse or neglect, the name, age and condition of other children residing in the same household and an evaluation of the parents and the home. The report of such investigation shall be in writing. The investigation shall also include, but not be limited to, a review of criminal conviction information concerning the person or persons alleged to be responsible for such abuse or neglect and previous allegations of abuse or neglect relating to the child or other children residing in the household or relating to family violence. After an investigation into a report of abuse or neglect has been completed, the commissioner shall determine, based upon a standard of reasonable cause, whether a child has been abused or neglected, as defined in section 46b-120 . If the commissioner determines that abuse or neglect has occurred, the commissioner shall also determine whether: (A) There is an identifiable person responsible for such abuse or neglect; and (B) such identifiable person poses a risk to the health, safety or well-being of children and should be recommended by the commissioner for placement on the child abuse and neglect registry established pursuant to section 17a-101k . If the commissioner has made the determinations in subparagraphs (A) and (B) of this subsection, the commissioner shall issue notice of a recommended finding to the person suspected to be responsible for such abuse or neglect in accordance with section 17a-101k . If the child is represented by an attorney or guardian ad litem, the commissioner shall notify the child's attorney or guardian ad litem in writing not less than five days prior to the date of any meeting in which the department is considering removing the child from the household, except, if the commissioner, or the commissioner's designee, has authorized the immediate removal of a child from his or her household pursuant to the provisions of subsection (e) of this section, the commissioner, or the commissioner's designee, shall not be required to provide advance written notice of such removal to the child's attorney or guardian ad litem.\n\n(c) Except as provided in subsection (d) of this section, no entry of the recommended finding shall be made on the child abuse or neglect registry and no information concerning the finding shall be disclosed by the commissioner pursuant to a check of the child abuse or neglect registry or request for information by a public or private entity for employment, licensure, or reimbursement for child care purposes pursuant to programs administered by the Department of Social Services or pursuant to any other general statute that requires a check of the child abuse or neglect registry until the exhaustion or waiver of all administrative appeals available to the person suspected to be responsible for the abuse or neglect, as provided in section 17a-101k .\n\n(d) If the child abuse or neglect resulted in or involves (1) the death of a child; (2) the risk of serious physical injury or emotional harm of a child; (3) the serious physical harm of a child; (4) the arrest of a person due to abuse or neglect of a child; (5) a petition filed by the commissioner pursuant to section 17a-112 or 46b-129 ; or (6) sexual abuse of a child, entry of the recommended finding may be made on the child abuse or neglect registry and information concerning the finding may be disclosed by the commissioner pursuant to a check of the child abuse or neglect registry or request for information by a public or private entity for employment, licensure, or reimbursement for child care purposes pursuant to programs administered by the Department of Social Services or pursuant to any other general statute that requires a check of the child abuse or neglect registry, prior to the exhaustion or waiver of all administrative appeals available to the person suspected to be responsible for the abuse or neglect as provided in section 17a-101k .\n\n(e) If the Commissioner of Children and Families, or the commissioner's designee, has probable cause to believe that the child or any other child in the household is in imminent risk of physical harm from the child's surroundings and that immediate removal from such surroundings is necessary to ensure the child's safety, the commissioner, or the commissioner's designee, shall authorize any employee of the department or any law enforcement officer to remove the child and any other child similarly situated from such surroundings without the consent of the child's parent or guardian. The commissioner shall record in writing the reasons for such removal and include such record with the report of the investigation conducted under subsection (b) of this section.\n\n(f) The removal of a child pursuant to subsection (e) of this section shall not exceed ninety-six hours. During the period of such removal, the commissioner, or the commissioner's designee, shall provide the child with all necessary care, including medical care, which may include an examination by a physician or mental health professional with or without the consent of the child's parents, guardian or other person responsible for the child's care, provided reasonable attempts have been made to obtain consent of the child's parents or guardian or other person responsible for the care of such child. During the course of a medical examination, a physician may perform diagnostic tests and procedures necessary for the detection of child abuse or neglect. If the child is not returned home within such ninety-six-hour period, with or without protective services, the department shall proceed in accordance with section 46b-129 .\n\n(g) (1) Notwithstanding the provisions of subsections (a) to (f), inclusive, of this section, the commissioner may establish a program of family assessment response to reports of child abuse and neglect whereby the report may be referred to appropriate community providers for family assessment and services without an investigation or at any time during an investigation, provided there has been an initial safety assessment of the circumstances of a family and child and criminal background checks have been performed on all adults involved in the report. Services provided through family assessment response shall include an array of community-based services and supports designed to meet the individual needs of families, build upon their strengths, enhance child development, reduce child abuse and neglect and increase the health, safety and well-being of children.\n\n(2) In response to an accepted family assessment report, the department shall conduct a comprehensive family assessment that shall include a safety and risk assessment and an assessment of family strengths and needs. Such assessment shall include personal interviews with the child and the child's parent or primary caretaker, an evaluation of the home environment and the performance of criminal background checks on all adults residing in the same household. Such assessment may include, as appropriate, personal interviews with other children or adults residing in the same household as well as any other caregivers, family members and collateral contacts. In conducting such assessment, the department shall consider the age and vulnerability of the child, family functioning, family history of abuse and neglect and family history of involvement with the department. The department shall, upon securing any necessary releases, request any relevant out-of-state history of child abuse or neglect involving any adults residing in the same household.\n\n(3) The following reports of suspected child abuse or neglect shall not be referred for family assessment response: (A) Sexual abuse, (B) abuse or neglect occurring in an out-of-home placement, (C) abuse or neglect resulting in the death or serious physical or mental injury of a child, or (D) where the department's safety assessment reveals that the child is unsafe. A case supervisor or manager shall approve all referrals to family assessment response.\n\n(4) Prior to referring a report to an appropriate community provider, the department shall develop a service plan designed to meet the family's immediate needs for services and supports and to guide the community provider's development of a long-term plan of care for the family.\n\n(5) Following a referral pursuant to subdivision (1) of this subsection, a community provider shall schedule an in-person meeting with the family and shall develop a plan of care. Such plan of care shall be developed in consultation with the family and shall include (A) a review of the department's family assessment and service plan and any services and supports the family is currently receiving, and (B) an identification of the family's ongoing needs and the services and supports that may be available to meet such needs. Such plan of care shall identify the family's strengths and needs and describe the services and supports to be offered to (i) address the family's needs, (ii) build upon the family's strengths, and (iii) increase the health, safety and well-being of the child. The provider shall monitor the family's participation and progress with the plan of care.\n\n(6) The community provider shall maintain ongoing contact with the family through in-person meetings, visits to the home, child and family team meetings and phone calls. If at any time following the referral or during the implementation of the plan of care, the provider has reasonable cause to suspect or believe that any child under eighteen years of age (A) has been abused or neglected, as defined in section 46b-120 , (B) has suffered a nonaccidental physical injury or an injury that is at variance with the history given for such injury, or (C) is placed at imminent risk of serious harm, the provider shall report or cause a report to be made in accordance with the provisions of sections 17a-101b to 17a-101d , inclusive.\n\n(7) The community provider shall schedule an in-person meeting with the family prior to the end of services. The determination to end services shall be based upon the family's preference and progress in meeting the goals outlined in the plan of care. The community provider shall submit individual child and family specific data and administrative service data to the department not later than thirty days after ending services. Such data shall identify the needs of the family, the services and supports made available to address those needs, the family's met and unmet treatment goals, the final disposition at the time of ending services and the reasons for the family's discharge from services, including, but not limited to, met treatment goals, family relocation, the receipt of a new report by the department or transfer of the family to another provider.\n\n(8) Subdivisions (5) to (7), inclusive, of this subsection shall apply to all community provider service contracts in effect on June 9, 2016, to the extent they are not in conflict with such contracts, and shall apply to all contracts entered into, amended, extended or renewed on or after June 9, 2016.\n\n(9) The commissioner shall adopt procedures to establish a method for the department to monitor the progress of the child and family referred to a community provider pursuant to subdivision (1) of this subsection and to set standards for reopening an investigation pursuant to this section. Such standards shall include, but need not be limited to, provisions for the reassignment of a report referred for family assessment response for an immediate investigation based on (A) a reassessment of the initial report of child abuse or neglect or the discovery of new or additional facts indicating that the child is unsafe, or (B) a determination that the report meets the criteria of subdivision (3) of this subsection and, as a result, does not qualify for family assessment response. Not later than January 1, 2017, the commissioner shall submit a report regarding such procedures and standards, in accordance with the provisions of section 11-4a , to the joint standing committee of the General Assembly having cognizance of matters relating to children.\n\n(10) Consistent with the provisions of section 17a-28 , the department shall disclose all relevant information in its possession concerning the child and family, including prior child protection activity, to each provider to whom a report has been referred for use by the provider in the assessment, diagnosis and treatment of unique needs of the family and the prevention of future reports. Each provider who has received a report of child abuse or neglect referred pursuant to this subsection shall disclose to the department, consistent with the provisions of section 17a-28 , all relevant information gathered during assessment, diagnosis and treatment of the child and family. The department may use such information solely to monitor and ensure the continued safety and well-being of the child or children.\n\n(11) Not later than July 1, 2016, and annually thereafter, the department shall submit a report, in accordance with the provisions of section 11-4a , to the joint standing committee of the General Assembly having cognizance of matters relating to children for inclusion in the annual report card prepared pursuant to section 2-53m on the status of family assessment response. Such report shall include data from the previous calendar year, including, but not limited to: (A) The number of accepted reports of child abuse or neglect, and the percentage of reports assigned to the family assessment response track; (B) the disposition of families assigned a family assessment response; (C) for cases assigned to the family assessment response track, a breakdown by reporter type; (D) the number and percentage of family assessment response cases that changed track to investigations; (E) an analysis of the department's prior or subsequent involvement with a family that has been assigned to family assessment response, if applicable; (F) an analysis of the department's prior or subsequent involvement with a family that has been assigned to a community partner agency; (G) a description of services that are commonly provided to families referred to the community support for families program; (H) a description of the department's staff development and training practices relating to intake; (I) the number and percentage of referred families who were ultimately enrolled in the community support for families program; (J) the number and percentage of families receiving a family assessment response broken down by race and ethnicity; (K) the reason for discharge from the community support for families program, as identified in subdivision (7) of this subsection, broken down by race and ethnicity; (L) a comparison of the needs identified and the needs addressed for families referred to the community support for families program; and (M) an analysis of the efficacy of the department's risk and safety assessment practices, including information concerning the methodology used to determine the reliability of such practices, the utilization of evidence-based practices and tools, and the effectiveness of such assessment practices for identifying children at risk for abuse or neglect."

If a petition indicates that either or both parents consent to the termination of their parental rights, or if at any time following the filing of a petition and before the entry of a decree, a parent consents to the termination of the parent's parental rights, each consenting parent shall acknowledge such consent on a form promulgated by the Office of the Chief Court Administrator evidencing that the parent has voluntarily and knowingly consented to the termination of such parental rights.

The postadoption agreement shall be applicable only to a birth parent who is a party to the agreement. Such agreement shall be in addition to those under common law.

Not unconstitutional as applied to termination of parental rights of an unfit mother upon proof by clear and convincing evidence that her child has been, among other things, uncared for. 270 C. 382. Even if the evidence had established that additional family therapy might have been beneficial, trial court's finding that department made reasonable efforts at reunification was not clearly erroneous. 290 C. 131. Under 2003 revision, department must prove either that it has made reasonable efforts to reunify parent and child or, alternatively, that the parent is unwilling or unable to benefit from reunification efforts. 293 C. 539. Where prior neglect adjudication must be opened, there was no longer any basis for trial court's finding that the children were neglected, regardless of whether parent raised claim on appeal, because court's finding was based on the prior neglect adjudication. 301 C. 345. A prior order of specific steps toward rehabilitation is required for any termination of parental rights grounded solely on a parent's failure to rehabilitate, except that, under the particular circumstances of this case, failure to provide specific steps constituted harmless error. 310 C. 485. It was necessary for the trial court to consider events subsequent to the filing of the petition for termination of parental rights when determining whether the department has made reasonable efforts to reunify child with respondent. 321 C. 523. Subdiv. (1): Finding of reunification efforts not required under section and Sec. 17a-111b is an independent basis on which to terminate parental rights. 322 C. 231. Department's failure to make reasonable modifications to its services, programs or activities to accommodate a parent's disability would likely preclude a finding under Subdiv. (1) that the department's reunification efforts were reasonable under the circumstances. 326 C. 480. Subdiv. (3)(C): “act or acts of parental commission or omission” includes both positively harmful actions of a parent and a parent's more passive failures to take action to prevent harm from occurring, and respondents' omissions, namely their failure over the course of three years to acknowledge the cause of the child's injuries and to take therapeutic steps that would prevent a similar tragedy from occurring in the future, clearly fell within the purview of Subpara. 327 C. 506. The statutory criteria must be strictly complied with before the termination of parental rights can be accomplished and adoption proceedings begun. 334 C. 314."

Resolution of whether termination petitions are appropriate requires a trial court to determine, inter alia, if termination of parental rights would serve best interests of the child. Id., 706. Trial court's determination that grounds existed to terminate respondent's parental rights was not clearly erroneous where trial court concluded that respondent's failure to believe child when confronted with child's account of incidents of abuse as well as with abuser's admission of abuse, and respondent's failure to protect child from further abuse, to utilize reunification services and to cooperate with police and department to ensure child's protection, constitute acts violative of Subdiv. (3)(C). Id., 763. Moving out of state relevant circumstance to determination of reasonable effort to reunite family. 50 CA 554. Provisions for granting a petition under Subsec. interpreted. 51 CA 595. “Reasonable efforts” in Subdiv. (1) defined and department required to take into consideration parent's mental condition when determining what “reasonable efforts” to make at reunification. 54 CA 463. Trial court properly found, with respect to Subdiv. (3)(D), that biological father of the minor child did not maintain an ongoing parent-child relationship and that to allow additional time for establishing such a relationship would be detrimental to the best interests of the minor child who had no positive memories of and negative feelings toward her father. 55 CA 807. Subdiv. (3): Abandonment focuses on parent's conduct and occurs where a parent fails to visit a child, does not display love or affection for the child, does not personally interact with the child and demonstrates no concern for the child's welfare; to “maintain” a reasonable degree of interest, concern or responsibility implies a continuing, reasonable degree of concern and not a sporadic showing. 56 CA 12. As used in Subdiv. (3)(B), personal rehabilitation refers to restoration of a parent to his or her former constructive and useful role as a parent; Subdiv. (3)(B) is not void for vagueness; it provides fair warning of the conduct necessary for personal rehabilitation and provides minimum guidelines for enforcement. Id., 167. Failure to achieve rehabilitation must be proven by clear and convincing evidence, which is something more than preponderance of the evidence, required in neglect proceedings and in other civil cases, but something less than proof beyond a reasonable doubt, required in criminal cases; rehabilitation must be foreseeable within a reasonable time, which is a factual determination that must be made on case-by-case basis. Id., 688. “Personal rehabilitation” under Subdiv. (3)(B), revised to 1997, defined. 57 CA 441. Discussed re parent's failure to achieve sufficient personal rehabilitation and lack of an ongoing parent-child relationship; Appellate Court need only find one statutory basis to affirm decision to terminate parental rights. 58 CA 234. Father abandoned child within meaning of statute; claim is not valid that section is unconstitutionally void for vagueness because it fails to put an incarcerated parent on notice re how to prevent termination of parental rights; section does not violate double jeopardy clause of U.S. Constitution as applied to incarcerated parent. Id., 244. Subdiv. (3)(B) requires trial court to analyze respondent's rehabilitative status as it relates to needs of the child and such rehabilitation must be foreseeable within a reasonable time; trial court's finding that respondent failed to achieve sufficient personal rehabilitation was not clearly erroneous. 61 CA 19. Adjudication of neglect is not a prerequisite to order terminating parental rights on the basis of abandonment. Id., 185. Court did not abuse its discretion when it declined to apply Matthews v. Eldridge balancing test in denying respondent's motion to bifurcate termination hearing; Subsec. protects due process rights of respondent by requiring clear and convincing evidence in the adjudicatory phase. Id., 197. Evidence and standards re determination of degree of personal rehabilitation under Subdiv. (3)(B) in adjudicatory phase of termination proceedings discussed. Id., 224. Reasonable efforts, for purposes of Subdiv. (1), means doing everything reasonable, not everything possible; relative youth of respondent not an excuse in determination of failure to achieve personal rehabilitation under Subdiv. (3)(B). Id., 248. Department's act of offering mother substance abuse evaluation and treatment, parenting skill classes, domestic violence counseling, a family reunification program, a psychological evaluation and visitation constituted “reasonable efforts to locate the parent and to reunify the child with the parent”; trial court's determination to terminate parental rights based on failure to achieve sufficient personal rehabilitation affirmed. 62 CA 470. Father's claim under Subsec. is moot because father did not challenge court's finding that he was unwilling to benefit from reunification efforts, which finding satisfied the statute's first prong; case is distinguishable from In re Valerie D . because here it was the father's own conduct, not conduct of a third party, that prevented development of a relationship with his children. Id., 500. Subdiv. (3)(D): Trial court's conclusion that there was no ongoing parent-child relationship was factually supported by the record; evidence established that 9-year-old child had no present memories of or feelings for respondent father and had never known his father; court also found by clear and convincing evidence that it was not in child's best interest to allow further time to establish a parent-child relationship because child is very emotionally fragile and suffers from several disorders, has bonded with his maternal grandparents who are making progress with him, has a strong need for permanency and respondent father is unable to understand child's special needs. 63 CA 516. Lack of rehabilitation may be demonstrated by the length of time in which defendant waits to begin the first rehabilitative steps. 65 CA 538. Court properly based its decision on 217 C. 459 where respondent, rather than the state, created circumstances that caused and perpetuated the lack of an ongoing relationship between respondent and the child. 67 CA 417. Trial court's determination that department had made reasonable efforts to reunify respondent and her child was not clearly erroneous. 68 CA 342. Trial court improperly concluded that department's efforts to reunify respondent with minor child were reasonable under circumstances of case where department acknowledged that decision not to engage respondent in further reunification efforts was based on prior experiences with respondent; at department's request, respondent completed substance abuse treatment yet department did not make reasonable efforts at reunification when it should have done so; trial court's finding that respondent was unable or unwilling to benefit from reunification efforts not supported by clear and convincing evidence. 73 CA 637. In determining whether there was an ongoing parent-child relationship, it is the character of that relationship at the time of the filing of termination petition that is relevant to court's inquiry. 75 CA 466. Subdiv. (3)(B): Personal rehabilitation refers to restoration of a parent to his or her former constructive and useful role as a parent; statute requires court to find by clear and convincing evidence that the parent's level of rehabilitation is less than that which would encourage a belief that he or she can assume a responsible position in the child's life within a reasonable time. 83 CA 17. Consideration of best interest of child comes after a determination that termination is warranted. 85 CA 528. Statutory requirements for termination of parental rights discussed; court properly concluded that commissioner had established, by clear and convincing evidence, that, despite parental skills training provided by department to parents, parents did not have ability to care for their daughters, either at time of termination proceedings or in the immediately foreseeable future; legislature's choice of “clear and convincing evidence” standard of proof under Subsec. does not violate due process provisions of state constitution; state constitution does not require court or legislature to equate terminations of parental rights with criminal convictions. 90 CA 565. Judgment terminating father's parental rights was improper and could not stand where evidence showed department made no efforts to foster a relationship between child and father prior to filing of termination petition because father's paternity had not been conclusively established. 93 CA 42. Subdiv. (3): Although “serious physical injury” in Subpara. (F) is not defined in statute, the court looked to its commonly approved usage, which is its dictionary definition; when applied to circumstances of case, there is ample evidence that the child's physical injury, a broken elbow caused by respondent mother who threw her young child across the floor and failed to seek medical attention for her injury for almost five days after the assault, was serious since the assault caused a severe fracture to child's elbow, required casting and caused distress to the child for at least three weeks after the assault. 97 CA 748. Subdiv. (3)(B)(ii): Neither Appellate Court nor trial court may speculate, or make a finding with respect to a termination of parental rights petition, on the basis of evidence that is not in the record. 104 CA 635. Subdiv. (3)(B)(ii): Issue is not whether parent has improved her ability to manage her life but whether she has gained an ability to care for the specific needs of her children. Id., 744. Subdiv. (3)(B): In making the determination as to whether the parent has achieved a sufficient degree of personal rehabilitation, the proper focus is on the parent's demonstrable development in relation to the needs of the child; the critical issue in assessing rehabilitation is whether the parent has gained the ability to care for the particular needs of the child at issue. 108 CA 839. In action for the termination of parental rights, the court did not deny respondent her procedural due process rights when conducting a trial on the merits with only her counsel present as the court still required petitioner to prove by clear and convincing evidence not only the grounds for termination, but that it was in the child's best interest for respondent's parental rights to be terminated. 111 CA 210. Trial court properly concluded that mother's denial of drug use and refusal to submit to drug testing supported adjudication that she failed to achieve personal rehabilitation under Subdiv. (3)(B); court properly determined that mother failed to achieve personal rehabilitation under section despite extensive use of support systems. 112 CA 69. Parental rights may be terminated under Subdiv. (3)(B)(i) because a parent must be able to meet the needs of the child, which are paramount, regardless of the needs of the parent, and the critical issue is not whether the parent has improved ability to manage own life but whether the parent has gained ability to care for the needs of the child. Id., 582. Reasonable efforts to reunite respondent and child were no longer appropriate where respondent abandoned child by leaving home and not communicating with child or inquiring as to child's welfare while respondent was living and incarcerated in another state or when he returned to Connecticut, where he failed to support child and was convicted and incarcerated for sexual assault of a minor. 115 CA 111. Department made reasonable efforts to reunify child with parent where department offered mother substance abuse treatment, group and individual therapy, drug testing, supervised and unsupervised visitation, parenting education, psychological evaluation, in-home reunification services, housing assistance and transportation and mother failed to achieve a sufficient degree of personal rehabilitation and her inability to parent prevented her from assuming a responsible position with respect to her child. 117 CA 710. Subdiv. (3)(B): Trial court must analyze the respondent's rehabilitative status as it relates to the needs of the particular child and whether prospects for rehabilitation can be realized within a reasonable time given the age and needs of the child. 120 CA 523. Subsec. not unconstitutionally void for vagueness as applied to respondent since referral for sexual offender treatment was sufficient to put respondent on notice that failure to attend could result in termination of his parental rights. 121 CA 376. Court improperly required petitioner to prove a subordinate fact by clear and convincing evidence. 123 CA 103. Subdiv. (3): Unresolved issues of domestic violence and lack of stable, safe housing support conclusion that parent failed to achieve sufficient degree of personal rehabilitation; respondent did not demonstrate that her counsel's representation resulted in prejudice to her. 126 CA 71. A 3-month time frame for achieving necessary degree of personal rehabilitation was reasonable given the age and needs of the child. 129 CA 449. Subdiv. (3)(B): “Rehabilitation” is not limited to the conduct contemplated in the prescribed specific steps. 148 CA 308. Subdiv. (3)(B): The use of “provide” in Subpara. does not require physical delivery of the specific steps to parent where parent has evaded detection or refused to respond to department's inquiries, neither is there one-size-fits-all definition prescribing steps to be taken, rather, it is more consistent with jurisprudence in this area that this issue be addressed on case-by-case basis. 185 CA 512. Subdiv. (1): Where respondent challenged only one of the two separate and independent bases for upholding court's determination that the requirements of the Subdiv. had been satisfied, court unable to provide respondent with practical relief on appeal. 190 CA 583. In analyzing issue of reasonable reunification efforts under Subsec., trial court did not improperly fail to consider events that occurred after the adjudication date as there were no obvious factors that affected the practicality of reunification efforts prior to such date. 194 CA 633. Subdiv. (3)(D): Failure to establish that no parent-child relationship existed between respondent and child does not inevitably lead to conclusion that the parent-child relationship was normal and healthy or meaningful. 202 CA 106. Subdiv. (3)(C): Although the respondent did not commit physical or sexual abuse against his own children, his sexual assault of another minor and consequent incarceration resulted in his children being abused and neglected in the custody of their mother and denied his children the care, guidance, or control necessary for their wellbeing. 211 CA 275. Subdiv. (1): Mother's failure to challenge termination of parental rights on both statutory grounds rendered complaint moot. 218 CA 424. Subdiv. (3)(B): It is well established that personal rehabilitation does not require a parent to prove ability to assume full responsibility for the child, unaided by available support systems; although respondent argued that the evidentiary sufficiency standard of review in child protection cases should be replaced by the former clear error standard, the Supreme Court's decision in 318 C. 569, holding that the appropriate standard of review is evidentiary sufficiency, is binding. 220 CA 315, 322."

Trial court's findings that department had made the statutorily required “reasonable efforts” to reunify children with their mother were not supported by clear and convincing evidence; judgments reversed. 48 CA 290. Record supported trial court's factual findings where trial court found that respondent's decision to protect abuser, to deny or disregard the effects of sexual abuse on the child and to refuse counseling services prevented respondent from having a relationship with the child, and that department offered various counseling services to assist respondent and to facilitate reunification with the child, but respondent failed to utilize them. 49 CA 763. Subdiv. (1): Although respondent mother was offered a number of services by department aimed at reunification, including overnight visitation, visitation at the school and rehabilitation center, a bus pass to facilitate transportation, a psychological evaluation and various other social worker services, she failed to take advantage of them and to become more than minimally involved in her child's life; court found by clear and convincing evidence that department made reasonable and appropriate efforts to reunite respondent mother with her child. 56 CA 12.

The petition shall be in the form and contain the information set forth in subsection (b) of section 45a-715 , and be subject to the provisions of subsection (c) of said section. If a petition indicates that either or both parents consent to the termination of their parental rights, or if at any time following the filing of a petition and before the entry of a decree, a parent consents to the termination of the parent's parental rights, each consenting parent shall acknowledge such consent on a form promulgated by the Office of the Chief Court Administrator evidencing that the parent has voluntarily and knowingly consented to the termination of such parental rights. No consent to termination by a mother shall be executed within forty-eight hours immediately after the birth of such mother's child. A parent who is a minor shall have the right to consent to termination of parental rights and such consent shall not be voidable by reason of such minority. A guardian ad litem shall be appointed by the court to assure that such minor parent is giving an informed and voluntary consent.\n\n(b) Either or both birth parents and an intended adoptive parent may enter into a cooperative postadoption agreement regarding communication or contact between either or both birth parents and the adopted child. Such an agreement may be entered into if: (1) The child is in the custody of the Department of Children and Families; (2) an order terminating parental rights has not yet been entered; and (3) either or both birth parents agree to a voluntary termination of parental rights, including an agreement in a case which began as an involuntary termination of parental rights. The postadoption agreement shall be applicable only to a birth parent who is a party to the agreement. Such agreement shall be in addition to those under common law. Counsel for the child and any guardian ad litem for the child may be heard on the proposed cooperative postadoption agreement. There shall be no presumption of communication or contact between the birth parents and an intended adoptive parent in the absence of a cooperative postadoption agreement.\n\n(c) If the Superior Court determines that the child's best interests will be served by postadoption communication or contact with either or both birth parents, the court shall so order, stating the nature and frequency of the communication or contact. A court may grant postadoption communication or contact privileges if: (1) Each intended adoptive parent consents to the granting of communication or contact privileges; (2) the intended adoptive parent and either or both birth parents execute a cooperative agreement and file the agreement with the court; (3) consent to postadoption communication or contact is obtained from the child, if the child is at least twelve years of age; and (4) the cooperative postadoption agreement is approved by the court.\n\n(d) A cooperative postadoption agreement shall contain the following: (1) An acknowledgment by either or both birth parents that the termination of parental rights and the adoption is irrevocable, even if the adoptive parents do not abide by the cooperative postadoption agreement; and (2) an acknowledgment by the adoptive parents that the agreement grants either or both birth parents the right to seek to enforce the cooperative postadoption agreement.\n\n(e) The terms of a cooperative postadoption agreement may include the following: (1) Provision for communication between the child and either or both birth parents; (2) provision for future contact between either or both birth parents and the child or an adoptive parent; and (3) maintenance of medical history of either or both birth parents who are parties to the agreement.\n\n(f) The order approving a cooperative postadoption agreement shall be made part of the final order terminating parental rights.

Such an agreement shall not affect the ability of the adoptive parents and the child to change their residence within or outside this state.\n\n(g) A disagreement between the parties or litigation brought to enforce or modify the agreement shall not affect the validity of the termination of parental rights or the adoption and shall not serve as a basis for orders affecting the custody of the child. The court shall not act on a petition to change or enforce the agreement unless the petitioner had participated, or attempted to participate, in good faith in mediation or other appropriate dispute resolution proceedings to resolve the dispute and allocate any cost for such mediation or dispute resolution proceedings.\n\n(h) An adoptive parent, guardian ad litem for the child or the court, on its own motion, may, at any time, petition for review of any order entered pursuant to subsection (c) of this section, if the petitioner alleges that such action would be in the best interests of the child. The court may modify or terminate such orders as the court deems to be in the best interest of the adopted child.\n\n(i) The Superior Court upon hearing and notice, as provided in sections 45a-716 and 45a-717 , may grant a petition for termination of parental rights based on consent filed pursuant to this section if it finds that (1) upon clear and convincing evidence, the termination is in the best interest of the child, and (2) such parent has voluntarily and knowingly consented to termination of the parent's parental rights with respect to such child. If the court denies a petition for termination of parental rights based on consent, it may refer the matter to an agency to assess the needs of the child, the care the child is receiving and the plan of the parent for the child. Consent for the termination of the parental rights of one parent does not diminish the parental rights of the other parent of the child, nor does it relieve the other parent of the duty to support the child.\n\n(j) The Superior Court, upon notice and hearing as provided in sections 45a-716 and 45a-717 , may grant a petition filed pursuant to this section if it finds by clear and convincing evidence that (1) the Department of Children and Families has made reasonable efforts to locate the parent and to reunify the child with the parent in accordance with subsection (a) of section 17a-111b , unless the court finds in this proceeding that the parent is unable or unwilling to benefit from reunification efforts, except that such finding is not required if the court has determined at a hearing pursuant to section 17a-111b , or determines at trial on the petition, that such efforts are not required, (2) termination is in the best interest of the child, and (3) (A) the child has been abandoned by the parent in the sense that the parent has failed to maintain a reasonable degree of interest, concern or responsibility as to the welfare of the child; (B) the child (i) has been found by the Superior Court or the Probate Court to have been neglected, abused or uncared for in a prior proceeding, or (ii) is found to be neglected, abused or uncared for and has been in the custody of the commissioner for at least fifteen months and the parent of such child has been provided specific steps to take to facilitate the return of the child to the parent pursuant to section 46b-129 and has failed to achieve such degree of personal rehabilitation as would encourage the belief that within a reasonable time, considering the age and needs of the child, such parent could assume a responsible position in the life of the child; (C) the child has been denied, by reason of an act or acts of parental commission or omission including, but not limited to, sexual molestation or exploitation, severe physical abuse or a pattern of abuse, the care, guidance or control necessary for the child's physical, educational, moral or emotional well-being, except that nonaccidental or inadequately explained serious physical injury to a child shall constitute prima facie evidence of acts of parental commission or omission sufficient for the termination of parental rights; (D) there is no ongoing parent-child relationship, which means the relationship that ordinarily develops as a result of a parent having met on a day-to-day basis the physical, emotional, moral and educational needs of the child and to allow further time for the establishment or reestablishment of such parent-child relationship would be detrimental to the best interest of the child; (E) the parent of a child under the age of seven years who is neglected, abused or uncared for, has failed, is unable or is unwilling to achieve such degree of personal rehabilitation as would encourage the belief that within a reasonable period of time, considering the age and needs of the child, such parent could assume a responsible position in the life of the child and such parent's parental rights of another child were previously terminated pursuant to a petition filed by the Commissioner of Children and Families; (F) the parent has killed through deliberate, nonaccidental act another child of the parent or has requested, commanded, importuned, attempted, conspired or solicited such killing or has committed an assault, through deliberate, nonaccidental act that resulted in serious bodily injury of another child of the parent; or (G) the parent committed an act that constitutes sexual assault as described in section 53a-70 , 53a-70a , 53a-70c , 53a-71 , 53a-72a , 53a-72b or 53a-73a or compelling a spouse or cohabitor to engage in sexual intercourse by the use of force or by the threat of the use of force as described in section 53a-70b of the general statutes, revision of 1958, revised to January 1, 2019, if such act resulted in the conception of the child.\n\n(k) Except in the case where termination of parental rights is based on consent, in determining whether to terminate parental rights under this section, the court shall consider and shall make written findings regarding: (1) The timeliness, nature and extent of services offered, provided and made available to the parent and the child by an agency to facilitate the reunion of the child with the parent;

and (7) the extent to which a parent has been prevented from maintaining a meaningful relationship with the child by the unreasonable act or conduct of the other parent of the child, or the unreasonable act of any other person or by the economic circumstances of the parent.\n\n(l) Any petition brought by the Commissioner of Children and Families to the Superior Court, pursuant to subsection (a) of section 46b-129 , may be accompanied by or, upon motion by the petitioner, consolidated with a petition for termination of parental rights filed in accordance with this section with respect to such child.

The Superior Court may appoint a statutory parent at any time after it has terminated parental rights if the petitioner so requests.\n\n(n) If the parental rights of only one parent are terminated, the remaining parent shall be the sole parent and, unless otherwise provided by law, guardian of the person.\n\n(o) In the case where termination of parental rights is granted, the guardian of the person or statutory parent shall report to the court not later than thirty days after the date judgment is entered on a case plan, as defined by the federal Adoption and Safe Families Act of 1997, as amended from time to time, for the child which shall include measurable objectives and time schedules. At least every three months thereafter, such guardian or statutory parent shall make a report to the court on the progress made on implementation of the plan. The court may convene a hearing upon the filing of a report and shall convene and conduct a permanency hearing pursuant to subsection (k) of section 46b-129 for the purpose of reviewing the permanency plan for the child not more than twelve months from the date judgment is entered or from the date of the last permanency hearing held pursuant to subsection (k) of section 46b-129 , whichever is earlier, and at least once a year thereafter while the child remains in the custody of the Commissioner of Children and Families. For children where the commissioner has determined that adoption is appropriate, the report on the implementation of the plan shall include a description of the reasonable efforts the department is taking to promote and expedite the adoptive placement and to finalize the adoption of the child, including documentation of child specific recruitment efforts. At such hearing, the court shall determine whether the department has made reasonable efforts to achieve the permanency plan. If the court determines that the department has not made reasonable efforts to place a child in an adoptive placement or that reasonable efforts have not resulted in the placement of the child, the court may order the Department of Children and Families, within available appropriations, to contract with a child-placing agency to arrange for the adoption of the child. The department, as statutory parent, shall continue to provide care and services for the child while a child-placing agency is arranging for the adoption of the child.\n\n(p) The provisions of section 17a-152 , regarding placement of a child from another state, and the provisions of section 17a-175 , regarding the Interstate Compact on the Placement of Children, shall apply to placements pursuant to this section.\n\n(q) The provisions of this section shall be liberally construed in the best interests of any child for whom a petition under this section has been filed.\n\nSee Sec. 45a-764 re adoption procedures."

Finding.\n\nThe states which are parties to this compact find that:\n\n(1) In order to obtain adoptive families for children with special needs, states must assure prospective adoptive parents of substantial assistance, usually on a continuing basis, in meeting the high costs of supporting and providing for the special needs and the services required by such children.\n\n(2) The states have a fundamental interest in promoting adoption for children with special needs because the care, emotional stability, and general support and encouragement required by such children can be best, and often only, obtained in family homes with a normal parent-child relationship.\n\n(3) The states obtain fiscal advantages from providing adoption assistance because the alternative is for the states to bear the higher cost of meeting all the needs of all children while in foster care.\n\n(4) The necessary assurances of adoption assistance for children with special needs, in those instances where children and adoptive parents live in states other than the one undertaking to provide the assistance, include the establishment and maintenance of suitable substantive guarantees and workable procedures for interstate cooperation and payments to assist with the necessary costs of child maintenance, the procurement of services and the provision of medical assistance.\n\nArticle II. Purposes.\n\nThe purposes of this compact are to:\n\n(1) Strengthen protections for the interests of children with special needs on behalf of whom adoption assistance is committed to be paid, when such children are in or move to states other than the one committed to provide adoption assistance.\n\n(2) Provide substantive assurances and operating procedures which will promote the delivery of medical and other services to children on an interstate basis through programs of adoption assistance established by the laws of the states which are parties to this compact.\n\nArticle III. Definitions.\n\nAs used in this compact, unless the context clearly requires a different construction:\n\n(1) “Child with special needs” means a minor who has not yet attained the age at which the state normally discontinues children's services, or a child who has not yet reached the age of twenty-one, where the state determines that the child's mental or physical disability warrants the continuation of assistance beyond the age of majority, for whom the state has determined the following:\n\n(A) That the child cannot or should not be returned to the home of his or her parents;\n\n(B) That there exists, with respect to the child, a specific factor or condition, such as his or her ethnic background, age or membership in a minority or sibling group, or the presence of factors such as a medical condition or physical, mental or emotional disability, because of which it is reasonable to conclude that such child cannot be placed with adoptive parents without providing adoption assistance; and\n\n(C) That, except where it would be against the best interests of the child because of such factors as the existence of significant emotional ties with prospective adoptive parents while in their care as a foster child, a reasonable but unsuccessful effort has been made to place the child with appropriate adoptive parents without providing adoption assistance.\n\n(2) “Adoption assistance” means the payment or payments for the maintenance of a child which are made or committed to be made pursuant to the adoption assistance program established by the laws of a party state.\n\n(3) “State” means a state of the United States, the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, Guam, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands or any territory or possession of the United States.\n\n(4) “Adoption assistance state” means the state that is signatory to the adoption assistance agreement in a particular case.\n\n(5) “Residence state” means the state in which the child is a resident by virtue of the residence of the adoptive parents.\n\n(6) “Parents” means either the singular or plural of the word “parent”.\n\nArticle IV. Adoption Assistance.\n\n(a) Each state shall determine the amount of adoption assistance and other aid which it will give to children with special needs and their adoptive parents in accordance with its own laws and programs. The adoption assistance and other aid may be made subject to periodic reevaluation of eligibility by the adoption assistance state in accordance with its laws.\n\n(b) The adoption assistance, medical assistance and other services and benefits to which this compact applies are those provided to children with special needs and their adoptive parents from the effective date of the adoption assistance agreement.\n\n(c) Every case of adoption assistance shall include a written adoption assistance agreement between the adoptive parents and the appropriate agency of the state undertaking to provide the adoption assistance. Every such agreement shall contain provisions for the fixing of actual or potential interstate aspects of the assistance so provided as follows:\n\n(1) An express commitment that the assistance so provided shall be payable without regard for the state of residence of the adoptive parents, both at the outset of the agreement period and at all times during its continuance;\n\n(2) A provision setting forth with particularity the types of care and services toward which the adoption assistance state will make payments;\n\n(3) A commitment to make medical assistance available to the child in accordance with Article V of this compact;\n\n(4) An express declaration that the agreement is for the benefit of the child, the adoptive parents and the state and that it is enforceable by any or all of them; and\n\n(5) The date or dates upon which each payment or other benefit provided thereunder is to commence, but in no event prior to the effective date of the adoption assistance agreement.\n\n(d) Any services or benefits provided for a child by the residence state and the adoption assistance state may be facilitated by the party states on each other's behalf. To this end, the personnel of the child welfare agencies of the party states shall assist each other, as well as the beneficiaries of adoption assistance agreements, in assuring prompt and full access to all benefits expressly included in such agreements.

Upon application therefore, the adoptive parents of a child who is the subject of such an adoption assistance agreement shall receive a medical assistance identification document made out in the child's name. The identification shall be issued by the medical assistance program of the residence state and shall entitle the child to the same benefits pursuant to the same procedures, as any other child who is covered by the medical assistance program in the state, whether or not the adoptive parents are themselves eligible for medical assistance.\n\n(b) The identification document shall bear no indication that an adoption assistance agreement with another state is the basis for its issuance. However, if the identification is issued pursuant to such an adoption assistance agreement, the records of the issuing state and the adoption assistance state shall show the fact, and shall contain a copy of the adoption assistance agreement and any amendment or replacement thereof, as well as all other pertinent information. The adoption assistance and medical assistance programs of the adoption assistance state shall be notified of the issuance of such identification.\n\n(c) A state which has issued a medical assistance identification document pursuant to this compact, which identification is valid and currently in force, shall accept, process and pay medical assistance claims thereon as it would with any other medical assistance claims by eligible residents.\n\n(d) The federally-aided medical assistance provided by a party state pursuant to this compact shall be in accordance with subsections (a) to (c), inclusive, of this article. In addition, when a child who is covered by an adoption assistance agreement is living in another party state, payment or reimbursement for any medical services and benefits specified under the terms of the adoption assistance agreement, which are not available to the child under Title XIX medical assistance program of the residence state, shall be made by the adoption assistance state as required by its law. Any payments so provided shall be of the same kind and at the same rates as provided for children who are living in the adoption assistance state. However, where the payment rate authorized for a covered service under the medical assistance program of the adoption assistance state exceeds the rate authorized by the residence state for that service, the adoption assistance state shall not be required to pay the additional amounts for the services or benefits covered by the residence state.\n\n(e) A child referred to in subsection (a) of this article, whose residence is changed from one party state to another party state, shall be eligible for federally-aided medical assistance under the medical assistance program of the new state of residence.\n\nArticle VI. Compact Administration.\n\n(a) In accordance with its own laws and procedures, each state which is a party to this compact shall designate a compact administrator and such deputy compact administrators as it deems necessary. The compact administrator shall coordinate all activities under this compact within his or her state. The compact administrator shall also be the principal contact for officials and agencies within and without the state for the facilitation of interstate relations involving this compact and the protection of benefits and services provided pursuant thereto. In this capacity, the compact administrator shall be responsible for assisting child welfare agency personnel from other party states and adoptive families receiving adoption and medical assistance on an interstate basis.\n\n(b) Acting jointly, the compact administrators shall develop uniform forms and administrative procedures for the interstate monitoring and delivery of adoption and medical assistance benefits and services pursuant to this compact. The forms and procedures so developed may deal with such matters as:\n\n(1) Documentation of continuing adoption assistance eligibility;\n\n(2) Interstate payments and reimbursements; and\n\n(3) Any and all other matters arising pursuant to this compact.\n\n(c) (1) Some or all of the parties to this compact may enter into supplementary agreements for the provision of or payment for additional medical benefits and services, as provided in subsection (d) of Article V of this compact; for interstate service delivery, pursuant to subsection (d) of Article IV of this compact, or for matters related thereto. Such agreements shall not be inconsistent with this compact, nor shall they relieve the party states of any obligation to provide adoption and medical assistance in accordance with applicable state and federal law and the terms of this compact.\n\n(2) Administrative procedures or forms implementing the supplementary agreements referred to in subdivision (1) of this subsection may be developed by joint action of the compact administrators of those states which are party to such supplementary agreements.\n\n(d) It shall be the responsibility of the compact administrator to ascertain whether and to what extent additional legislation may be necessary in his or her own state to carry out the provisions of this article or Article IV of this compact or any supplementary agreements pursuant to this compact.\n\nArticle VII.

The executing authority in any party state shall also provide copies of this compact upon request.\n\n(c) Withdrawal from this compact shall be by written notice, sent by the authority which executed it, to the appropriate officials of all other party states, but no such notice shall take effect until one year after it is given, in accordance with the requirements of this subsection.\n\n(d) All adoption assistance agreements outstanding and to which a party state is a signatory at the time when its withdrawal from this compact takes effect shall continue to have the effects given to them pursuant to this compact until they expire or are terminated in accordance with their provisions. Until such expiration or termination, all beneficiaries of the agreements involved shall continue to have all the rights and obligations conferred or imposed by this compact, and the withdrawing state shall continue to administer this compact to the extent necessary to accord and implement fully the rights and protections preserved hereby.\n\nArticle VIII. Construction and Severability.\n\nThe provisions of this compact shall be liberally construed to effectuate the purposes thereof. The provisions of this compact shall be severable, and if any phrase, clause, sentence or provision of this compact is declared to be contrary to the Constitution of the United States or of any party state, or where the applicability thereof to any government, agency, person or circumstance is held invalid, the validity of the remainder of this compact and the applicability thereof to any government, agency, person or circumstance shall not be affected thereby. If this compact shall be held contrary to the constitution of any state party thereto, this compact shall remain in full force and effect as to the remaining states and in full force and effect as to the state affected as to all severable matters.\n\nSee Sec. 17a-118 re responsibility of Department of Children and Families for adoption assistance agreement and subsidy payment."

If, following such reduction or termination, such condition or related conditions reoccur, the adopting or adoptive parent or parents may reapply for such subsidy. Upon receipt of such application and determination that such condition or related conditions have reoccurred, the commissioner shall grant such subsidy provided the adoptive parent or parents are still legally responsible for the support of the child or the child is receiving support from the adoptive family. If the subsidy is to be reduced or terminated by said commissioner, notice of such proposed reduction or termination shall be given, in writing, to the adoptive parent or parents and such adoptive parent or parents shall, at least thirty days prior to the imposition of said reduction or termination, be provided a hearing by the department in accordance with the provisions of chapter 54. If such an appeal is taken, the subsidy shall continue without modification or termination until the final decision of the department. Eligibility for such subsidy may continue until the child's twenty-first birthday if the condition that caused the child to be certified as a special needs child or related conditions continue to exist or have reoccurred and the child continues to qualify as a dependent of the legal adoptive parent under the Internal Revenue Code. In no case shall the eligibility for such subsidy continue beyond the child's twenty-first birthday.\n\nSee Sec. 17a-118 re responsibility of Department of Children and Families for adoption assistance agreement and subsidy payment."

              "(b) The commissioner shall establish a program of subsidized guardianship for the benefit of children who have been in foster care for not less than six consecutive months, for whom neither reunification with a parent nor adoption is an appropriate permanency option, and who have been living with a caregiver. A caregiver may request a guardianship subsidy from the commissioner.",

For purposes of this subsection, “child's sibling” includes a stepbrother, stepsister, a half-brother or a half-sister.",

The subsidized guardianship program shall also provide a monthly subsidy on behalf of the child payable to the caregiver that is based on the circumstances of the caregiver and the needs of the child and shall not exceed the foster care maintenance payment that would have been paid on behalf of the child if the child had remained in licensed foster care.",

The commissioner, or the commissioner's designee, may require that the subsidized guardian submit any additional documentation that the commissioner or designee deems necessary for the purpose of determining whether such child is still living with and receiving support from the subsidized guardian.

The commissioner shall develop and implement a plan that: (1) Maximizes use of the subsidized guardianship program to decrease the number of children in the legal custody of the commissioner and to reduce the number of children who would otherwise be placed into nonrelative foster care when there is a caregiver willing to provide care; (2) maximizes federal reimbursement for the costs of the subsidized guardianship program, provided whatever federal maximization method is employed shall not result in the caregiver of a child being subject to work requirements as a condition of receipt of benefits for the child or the benefits restricted in time or scope other than as specified in subsection (c) of this section; and (3) ensures necessary transfers of funds between agencies and interagency coordination in program implementation.

If such an appeal is taken, the subsidy shall continue without modification until the final decision of the department."

Said director shall be an elector of the state with expertise and experience in the fields of developmental services and advocacy for the rights of the individuals specified in subsection (a) of this section and shall be exempt from the classified service.\n\n(c) The Governor shall appoint the director of the Office of the Developmental Services Ombudsperson from a list of candidates prepared and submitted to the Governor by the Council on Developmental Services, established by section 17a-270 . The Governor shall notify the council of the pending expiration of the term of an incumbent ombudsperson not less than ninety days prior to the final day of the ombudsperson's term in office. If a vacancy occurs in the position of ombudsperson, the Governor shall notify the council immediately of the vacancy. The council shall meet to consider qualified candidates for the position of ombudsperson and shall submit a list of not more than five candidates to the Governor ranked in order of preference, not more than sixty days after receiving notice from the Governor of the pending expiration of the ombudsperson's term or the occurrence of a vacancy. The Governor shall designate, not more than sixty days after receipt of the list of candidates from the council, one candidate from the list for the position of ombudsperson. If, after the list is submitted to the Governor by the council, any candidate withdraws from consideration, the Governor shall designate a candidate from those remaining on the list. If the Governor fails to designate a candidate within sixty days of receipt of the list from the council, the council shall refer the candidate with the highest ranking on the list to the General Assembly for confirmation. If the General Assembly is not in session at the time of the Governor's or council's designation of a candidate, the candidate shall serve as the acting ombudsperson until the General Assembly meets and confirms the candidate as ombudsperson. A candidate serving as acting ombudsperson shall be entitled to compensation and have all the powers, duties and privileges of the ombudsperson. An ombudsperson shall serve a term of four years, not including any time served as acting ombudsperson, and may be reappointed by the Governor or shall remain in the position until a successor is appointed pursuant to this subsection. Although an incumbent ombudsperson may be reappointed, the Governor shall also consider additional candidates from a list submitted by the council as provided in this section.\n\n(d) The director of the Office of the Developmental Services Ombudsperson shall report monthly to the Council on Developmental Services and, in accordance with the provisions of section 11-4a , annually to the joint standing committee of the General Assembly having cognizance of matters relating to public health."

The person whose consent is required shall be informed of the nature and consequences of the particular medical treatment or surgical procedure, the reasonable risks, benefits and purpose of such medical treatment or surgical procedure and any alternative medical treatment or surgical procedure which is available. The consent of any person or of any parent or legal representative of any person may be withdrawn at any time prior to the commencement of the medical treatment or surgical procedure. The regional or training school director having custody and control of a person living in a residential facility may authorize necessary medical treatment or surgical procedure for such person where, in the opinion of the person's attending physician, the medical treatment or surgical procedure is of an emergency nature and there is insufficient time to obtain the required written consent provided for in this section.

The provisions of this subsection shall not apply to individuals with a legally valid advance directive.",

No treatment plan or course of treatment for any person placed or treated under the direction of the commissioner shall include the use of an aversive device which has not been tested for safety and efficacy and approved by the federal Food and Drug Administration, except any treatment plan or course of treatment including the use of such devices that was initiated prior to October 1, 1993. No treatment plan or course of treatment prescribed for any person placed or treated under the direction of the commissioner shall include the use of aversive procedures except in accordance with recommendations from a regional human rights committee and any procedures established by the Commissioner of Developmental Services. For purposes of this subsection, “aversive procedure” means the contingent use of an event which may be unpleasant, noxious or otherwise cause discomfort to alter the occurrence of a specific behavior or to protect an individual from injuring himself or herself or others and may include the use of physical isolation and mechanical and physical restraint. Nothing in this subsection shall prohibit persons who are not placed or treated under the direction of the Commissioner of Developmental Services from independently pursuing and obtaining any treatment plan or course of treatment as may otherwise be authorized by law. The commissioner shall adopt regulations, in accordance with chapter 54, to carry out the provisions of this subsection.\n\n(c) The Commissioner of Developmental Services shall adopt regulations, in accordance with the provisions of chapter 54, with respect to each facility or institution under the jurisdiction of the commissioner, with regard to the following: (1) Prohibiting the use of corporal punishment; (2) when and by whom therapies may be used; (3) which therapies may be used; and (4) when a person may be placed in restraint or seclusion or when force may be used upon a person.\n\n(d) A copy of any order prescribing the use of therapy, restraint or seclusion in accordance with the regulations adopted under subsection (c) of this section shall be made a part of the person's permanent clinical record together with the reasons for each such order and made available in compliance with existing statutes relating to the right to know.\n\n(e) The Commissioner of Developmental Services shall ensure that each person placed or treated under the commissioner's direction in any public or private facility is afforded the following rights and privileges: (1) The right to prompt, sufficient and appropriate medical and dental treatment; (2) the right to communicate freely and privately with any person, including, but not limited to, an attorney or other legal representative of the person's choosing; (3) the right to reasonable access to a telephone, both to make and receive calls in private, unless such access is used in violation of any federal or state statute; (4) the right to send and receive unopened mail and to make reasonable requests for assistance in the preparation of correspondence; (5) the safety of each person's personal effects shall be assured including the provision of reasonably accessible individual storage space; (6) the right to be free from unnecessary or excessive physical restraint; (7) the right to voice grievances without interference; (8) the right to a nourishing and well-balanced diet; (9) the right to be employed outside a facility and to receive assistance in his or her efforts to secure suitable employment. The department shall encourage the employment of such persons and shall promote the training of such persons for gainful employment, and all benefits of such employment shall accrue solely to the person employed; (10) the right to have the complete record maintained by the Department of Developmental Services concerning such person released for review, inspection and copying to such person's attorney or other legal representative notwithstanding any provisions of subsection (g) of section 4-193 or section 4-194 ; and (11) the right to receive or purchase his or her own clothing and personal effects, including toilet articles, and the right to wear such clothing and use such personal effects except where determined to be dangerous to the health or safety of the individual or others.\n\n(f) The Commissioner of Developmental Services shall require the attending physician of any person placed or treated in a residential facility under the direction of the commissioner to obtain informed written consent from the following persons prior to authorizing any medical treatment or surgical procedure, excluding routine medical treatment which is necessary to maintain the general health of the person or to prevent the spread of any communicable disease: (1) The person if such person is eighteen years of age or over or is legally emancipated and competent to give such consent; (2) the parent of a person under eighteen years of age who is not legally emancipated; or (3) the legal representative of a person of any age who is adjudicated unable to make informed decisions about matters relating to such person's medical care. The person whose consent is required shall be informed of the nature and consequences of the particular medical treatment or surgical procedure, the reasonable risks, benefits and purpose of such medical treatment or surgical procedure and any alternative medical treatment or surgical procedure which is available. The consent of any person or of any parent or legal representative of any person may be withdrawn at any time prior to the commencement of the medical treatment or surgical procedure. The regional or training school director having custody and control of a person living in a residential facility may authorize necessary medical treatment or surgical procedure for such person where, in the opinion of the person's attending physician, the medical treatment or surgical procedure is of an emergency nature and there is insufficient time to obtain the required written consent provided for in this section. The attending physician shall prepare a report describing the nature of the emergency which necessitated such medical treatment or surgical procedure and shall file a copy of such report in the patient's record.\n\n(g) The commissioner's oversight and monitoring of the medical care of persons placed or treated under the direction of the commissioner does not include the authority to make treatment decisions, except in limited circumstances in accordance with statutory procedures. In the exercise of such oversight and monitoring responsibilities, the commissioner shall not impede or seek to impede a properly executed medical order to withhold cardiopulmonary resuscitation. For purposes of this subsection, “properly executed medical order to withhold cardiopulmonary resuscitation” (1) means (A) a written order by the attending physician or advanced practice registered nurse; (B) in consultation and with the consent of the patient or a person authorized by law; (C) when the attending physician or advanced practice registered nurse is of the opinion that the patient is in a terminal condition, as defined in section 19a-570 ; and (D) when such physician or advanced practice registered nurse has requested and obtained a second opinion from a Connecticut licensed physician or advanced practice registered nurse in the appropriate specialty that confirms the patient's terminal condition; and (2) includes the entry of such an order when the attending physician or advanced practice registered nurse (A) is of the opinion that the patient is in the final stage of a terminal condition but cannot state that the patient may be expected to expire during the next several days or weeks, or (B) in consultation with a physician qualified to make a neurological diagnosis, deems the patient to be permanently unconscious, provided the commissioner has reviewed the decision with the department's director of health and clinical services, or such director's designee, the legal representative of the patient and others whom the commissioner deems appropriate, and determines that the order is a medically acceptable decision. The provisions of this subsection shall not apply to individuals with a legally valid advance directive.\n\n(h) Any person applying for services from the Commissioner of Developmental Services or any person placed by a Probate Court under the direction of the Commissioner of Developmental Services, and such person's legal representative, shall be informed orally and in writing at the time of application or placement of the rights guaranteed by this section. A summary of such rights shall be posted conspicuously in the public areas of every public or private facility providing services to persons under the care of the Commissioner of Developmental Services."

If the clinical staff in possession of the requested record determines that disclosure would assist the accomplishment of the objectives of diagnosis, treatment or referral, the record may be disclosed, to the extent allowed under state and federal law, to the requesting clinical staff without patient consent. Records disclosed shall be limited to records maintained at department facilities or crisis intervention programs funded by the department. The Commissioner of Mental Health and Addiction Services shall adopt regulations in accordance with chapter 54 to administer the provisions of this subsection and to ensure maximum safeguards of patient confidentiality.\n\n(u) The commissioner shall adopt regulations to establish a fair hearing process which provides the right to appeal final determinations of the Department of Mental Health and Addiction Services or of its grantee agencies as determined by the commissioner regarding: The nature of denial, involuntary reduction or termination of services. Such hearings shall be conducted in accordance with the provisions of chapter 54, after a person has exhausted the department's established grievance procedure. Any matter which falls within the jurisdiction of the Psychiatric Security Review Board under sections 17a-580 to 17a-603 , inclusive, shall not be subject to the provisions of this section. Any person receiving services from a Department of Mental Health and Addiction Services facility or a grantee agency determined by the commissioner to be subject to this subsection and who is aggrieved by a violation of sections 17a-540 to 17a-549 , inclusive, may elect to either use the procedure specified in this subsection or file for remedies under section 17a-550 .\n\n(v) The commissioner may designate any employee of the department to sign any contract, agreement or settlement on behalf of the Department of Mental Health and Addiction Services.\n\n(w) Notwithstanding the provisions of section 17b-90 , chapter 899 and to the extent permitted by federal law, in order to monitor and improve the quality of targeted case management services provided by the Department of Mental Health and Addiction Services and funded by the Medicaid program, the Commissioner of Mental Health and Addiction Services may enter into a memorandum of understanding with the Commissioner of Social Services that allows for the sharing of information concerning admissions to short-term acute care general hospitals and receipt of inpatient services by clients of the Department of Mental Health and Addiction Services who reside and receive services in the community and who receive medical benefits under the Medicaid program.\n\nSee Sec. 17b-277a re duty to establish informational program for applicants to Healthy Start program.\n\nSee Sec. 17b-492c re authority of Commissioner of Mental Health and Addiction Services with respect to Medicare Part D program.\n\nSee Sec. 19a-6d re Tobacco Abuse Reduction and Health Plan.\n\nSee Secs. 20-14i to 20-14j, inclusive, re administration of medication in day and residential programs and facilities.\n\nSee Sec. 52-146f re consent of patient to disclosure of records."

The notice shall inform the respondent that he or she has a right to be present at the hearing; that he or she has a right to counsel; that he or she, if indigent, has a right to have counsel appointed to represent him or her; and that he or she has a right to cross-examine witnesses testifying at any hearing upon such application.",
              "(b) (1) If the court finds such respondent is indigent or otherwise unable to pay for counsel, the court shall appoint counsel for such respondent, unless such respondent refuses counsel and the court finds that the respondent understands the nature of his or her refusal. The court shall provide such respondent a reasonable opportunity to select his or her own counsel to be appointed by the court. If the respondent does not select counsel or if counsel selected by the respondent refuses to represent such respondent or is not available for such representation, the court shall appoint counsel for the respondent from a panel of attorneys admitted to practice in this state provided by the Probate Court Administrator in accordance with regulations promulgated by the Probate Court Administrator in accordance with section 45a-77 . The reasonable compensation of appointed counsel shall be established by, and paid from funds appropriated to, the Judicial Department, except that if funds have not been included in the budget of the Judicial Department for such purposes, such compensation shall be established by the Probate Court Administrator and paid from the Probate Court Administration Fund.",
              "(2) Prior to such hearing, such respondent or his or her counsel, in accordance with the provisions of sections 52-146d to 52-146i , inclusive, shall be afforded access to all records including, but not limited to, hospital records if such respondent is hospitalized, and shall be entitled to take notes from any of such records. If such respondent is hospitalized at the time of the hearing, the hospital shall make available at such hearing for use by such hospitalized respondent or his or her counsel all records in its possession relating to the condition of such hospitalized respondent. Notwithstanding the provisions of sections 52-146d to 52-146i , inclusive, and subject to the rules of evidence as provided in subsection (h) of this section, all such hospital records directly relating to the hospitalized respondent shall be admissible at the request of any party or the Probate Court in any proceeding relating to confinement to or release from a hospital for psychiatric disabilities.",
              "(c) (1) The court shall require the certificates, signed under penalty of false statement, of at least two impartial physicians selected by the court, one of whom shall be a practicing psychiatrist, and each of whom shall be licensed to practice medicine in the state of Connecticut and shall have been a practitioner of medicine for at least one year and shall not be connected with the hospital for psychiatric disabilities to which the application is being made, or related by blood or marriage to the applicant, or to the respondent. Such certificates shall indicate that the physicians have personally examined the respondent not more than ten days prior to such hearing. The court shall appoint such physicians from a list of physicians and psychiatrists provided by the Commissioner of Mental Health and Addiction Services and such appointments shall be made in accordance with regulations promulgated by the Probate Court Administrator in accordance with section 45a-77 . Each such physician shall make a report on a separate form provided for that purpose by the Probate Court Administrator and shall answer such questions as may be set forth on such form as fully and completely as reasonably possible. Such form shall include, but not be limited to, questions relating to the specific psychiatric disabilities alleged, whether or not the respondent is dangerous to himself or herself or others, whether or not such illness has resulted or will result in serious disruption of the respondent's mental and behavioral functioning, whether or not hospital treatment is both necessary and available, whether or not less restrictive placement is recommended and available and whether or not the respondent is incapable of understanding the need to accept the recommended treatment on a voluntary basis. Each such physician shall state upon the form the reasons for his or her opinions. Such respondent or his or her counsel shall have the right to present evidence and cross-examine witnesses who testify at any hearing on the application. If such respondent notifies the court not less than three days before the hearing that he or she wishes to cross-examine the examining physicians, the court shall order such physicians to appear.",
              "(2) The court shall cause a recording of the testimony of such hearing to be made, to be transcribed only in the event of an appeal from the decree rendered under this section. A copy of such transcript shall be furnished without charge to any appellant whom the Probate Court finds unable to pay for such copy. The cost of such transcript shall be paid from funds appropriated to the Judicial Department.",
              "(3) If the court finds by clear and convincing evidence that the respondent has psychiatric disabilities and is dangerous to himself or herself or others or gravely disabled, the court shall make an order for his or her commitment, considering whether or not a less restrictive placement is available, to a hospital for psychiatric disabilities to be named in such order, there to be confined for the period of the duration of such psychiatric disabilities or until he or she is discharged or converted to voluntary status pursuant to section 17a-506 in due course of law. Such court order shall further command some suitable person to convey such person to such hospital for psychiatric disabilities and deliver him or her, with a copy of such order and of such certificates, to the keeper thereof. In appointing a person to execute such order, the court shall give preference to a near relative or friend of the person with psychiatric disabilities, so far as the court deems it practicable and judicious. Notice of any action taken by the court shall be given to the respondent and his or her attorney, if any, in such manner as the court concludes would be appropriate under the circumstances.",

If as a result of such examination, the respondent is committed under section 17a-502 , transportation of the respondent to any such hospital, if such respondent is a female, shall be in accordance with the provisions of section 17a-505 . If the respondent is not committed under section 17a-502 , the respondent shall be released and the reports of such physicians shall be sent to the Probate Court to satisfy the requirement of examination by two physicians under subsection (c) of this section.",
              "(e) The respondent shall be given the opportunity to elect voluntary status under section 17a-506 at any time prior to adjudication of the application, subject to the following provisions: (1) In the event that a patient is in the hospital, the patient shall be informed by a member of the hospital staff within twenty-four hours prior to the time an application is filed with the court, that he or she may continue in the hospital on a voluntary basis under the provisions of section 17a-506 , and any application for involuntary commitment by the hospital shall include a statement that such voluntary status has been offered to the respondent and refused, and (2) in the event that a respondent is not hospitalized, the notice of hearing shall inform the respondent that the respondent has the right to enter the hospital on a voluntary basis under the provisions of section 17a-506 , and, if the respondent enters the hospital under section 17a-506 , the application for involuntary commitment shall be withdrawn. When any patient who has elected voluntary status following the filing of an application but prior to adjudication in any proceeding for involuntary commitment thereafter notifies the hospital that he or she wants to be released, a new application for involuntary commitment may be filed. If such new application is filed not later than forty-five days after the patient's election of voluntary status on a prior application, the application for involuntary commitment may, at the discretion of the judge, be heard on the merits, notwithstanding the patient's subsequent request to remain a voluntary patient under the provisions of section 17a-506 . Notwithstanding the provisions of sections 17a-29 , 17a-540 , 17a-543 , 17a-544 , subsection (f) of section 17a-547 and section 17a-548 , if a patient under section 17a-506 refuses to accept medication or treatment in accordance with the treatment plan prescribed by the attending physician and such patient is imminently dangerous to himself or others, an application for involuntary commitment may be filed for such patient in accordance with the provisions of this section.",
              "(f) The respondent shall be present at any hearing for his or her commitment under this section. If the respondent is medicated at that time, the hospital shall provide written notice to the court of such fact and of the common effects of such medication.",
              "(g) The hospital shall notify each patient at least annually that such patient has a right to a further hearing pursuant to this section. If the patient requests such hearing, it shall be held by the Probate Court for the district in which the hospital is located. Any such request shall be immediately filed with the appropriate court by the hospital. After such request is filed with the Probate Court, it shall proceed in the manner provided in subsections (a), (b), (c) and (f) of this section. In addition, the hospital shall furnish the Probate Court for the district in which the hospital is located on a monthly basis with a list of all patients confined in the hospital involuntarily without release for one year since the last annual review under this section of the patient's commitment or since the original commitment. The hospital shall include in such notification the type of review the patient last received. If the patient's last annual review had a hearing, the Probate Court shall, within fifteen business days thereafter, appoint an impartial physician who is a psychiatrist from the list provided by the Commissioner of Mental Health and Addiction Services as set forth in subsection (c) of this section and not connected with the hospital in which the patient is confined or related by blood or marriage to the original applicant or to the respondent, which physician shall see and examine each such patient within fifteen business days after such physician's appointment and make a report forthwith to such court of the condition of the patient on forms provided by the Probate Court Administrator. If the Probate Court concludes that the confinement of any such patient should be reviewed by such court for possible release of the patient, the court, on its own motion, shall proceed in the manner provided in subsections (a), (b), (c) and (f) of this section, except that the examining physician shall be considered one of the physicians required by subsection (c) of this section. If the patient's last annual review did not result in a hearing, and in any event at least every two years, the Probate Court shall, within fifteen business days, proceed with a hearing in the manner provided in subsections (a), (b), (c) and (f) of this section. All costs and expenses, including Probate Court entry fees provided by statute, in conjunction with the annual psychiatric review and the judicial review under this subsection, except costs for physicians appointed pursuant to this subsection, shall be established by, and paid from funds appropriated to, the Judicial Department, except that if funds have not been included in the budget of the Judicial Department for such costs and expenses, such payment shall be made from the Probate Court Administration Fund. Compensation of any physician appointed to conduct the annual psychiatric review, to examine a patient for any hearing held as a result of such annual review or for any other biennial hearing required pursuant to sections 17a-75 to 17a-83 , inclusive, 17a-450 to 17a-483 , inclusive, 17a-495 to 17a-528 , inclusive, 17a-540 to 17a-550 , inclusive, 17a-560 to 17a-575 , inclusive, and 17a-615 to 17a-618 , inclusive, shall be paid by the state from funds appropriated to the Department of Mental Health and Addiction Services in accordance with rates established by the Department of Mental Health and Addiction Services.",

The notice shall inform the respondent that he or she has a right to be present at the hearing; that he or she has a right to counsel; that he or she, if indigent, has a right to have counsel appointed to represent him or her; and that he or she has a right to cross-examine witnesses testifying at any hearing upon such application.\n\n(b) (1) If the court finds such respondent is indigent or otherwise unable to pay for counsel, the court shall appoint counsel for such respondent, unless such respondent refuses counsel and the court finds that the respondent understands the nature of his or her refusal. The court shall provide such respondent a reasonable opportunity to select his or her own counsel to be appointed by the court. If the respondent does not select counsel or if counsel selected by the respondent refuses to represent such respondent or is not available for such representation, the court shall appoint counsel for the respondent from a panel of attorneys admitted to practice in this state provided by the Probate Court Administrator in accordance with regulations promulgated by the Probate Court Administrator in accordance with section 45a-77 . The reasonable compensation of appointed counsel shall be established by, and paid from funds appropriated to, the Judicial Department, except that if funds have not been included in the budget of the Judicial Department for such purposes, such compensation shall be established by the Probate Court Administrator and paid from the Probate Court Administration Fund.\n\n(2) Prior to such hearing, such respondent or his or her counsel, in accordance with the provisions of sections 52-146d to 52-146i , inclusive, shall be afforded access to all records including, but not limited to, hospital records if such respondent is hospitalized, and shall be entitled to take notes from any of such records. If such respondent is hospitalized at the time of the hearing, the hospital shall make available at such hearing for use by such hospitalized respondent or his or her counsel all records in its possession relating to the condition of such hospitalized respondent. Notwithstanding the provisions of sections 52-146d to 52-146i , inclusive, and subject to the rules of evidence as provided in subsection (h) of this section, all such hospital records directly relating to the hospitalized respondent shall be admissible at the request of any party or the Probate Court in any proceeding relating to confinement to or release from a hospital for psychiatric disabilities.\n\n(c) (1) The court shall require the certificates, signed under penalty of false statement, of at least two impartial physicians selected by the court, one of whom shall be a practicing psychiatrist, and each of whom shall be licensed to practice medicine in the state of Connecticut and shall have been a practitioner of medicine for at least one year and shall not be connected with the hospital for psychiatric disabilities to which the application is being made, or related by blood or marriage to the applicant, or to the respondent. Such certificates shall indicate that the physicians have personally examined the respondent not more than ten days prior to such hearing. The court shall appoint such physicians from a list of physicians and psychiatrists provided by the Commissioner of Mental Health and Addiction Services and such appointments shall be made in accordance with regulations promulgated by the Probate Court Administrator in accordance with section 45a-77 . Each such physician shall make a report on a separate form provided for that purpose by the Probate Court Administrator and shall answer such questions as may be set forth on such form as fully and completely as reasonably possible. Such form shall include, but not be limited to, questions relating to the specific psychiatric disabilities alleged, whether or not the respondent is dangerous to himself or herself or others, whether or not such illness has resulted or will result in serious disruption of the respondent's mental and behavioral functioning, whether or not hospital treatment is both necessary and available, whether or not less restrictive placement is recommended and available and whether or not the respondent is incapable of understanding the need to accept the recommended treatment on a voluntary basis. Each such physician shall state upon the form the reasons for his or her opinions. Such respondent or his or her counsel shall have the right to present evidence and cross-examine witnesses who testify at any hearing on the application. If such respondent notifies the court not less than three days before the hearing that he or she wishes to cross-examine the examining physicians, the court shall order such physicians to appear.\n\n(2) The court shall cause a recording of the testimony of such hearing to be made, to be transcribed only in the event of an appeal from the decree rendered under this section. A copy of such transcript shall be furnished without charge to any appellant whom the Probate Court finds unable to pay for such copy. The cost of such transcript shall be paid from funds appropriated to the Judicial Department.\n\n(3) If the court finds by clear and convincing evidence that the respondent has psychiatric disabilities and is dangerous to himself or herself or others or gravely disabled, the court shall make an order for his or her commitment, considering whether or not a less restrictive placement is available, to a hospital for psychiatric disabilities to be named in such order, there to be confined for the period of the duration of such psychiatric disabilities or until he or she is discharged or converted to voluntary status pursuant to section 17a-506 in due course of law. Such court order shall further command some suitable person to convey such person to such hospital for psychiatric disabilities and deliver him or her, with a copy of such order and of such certificates, to the keeper thereof. In appointing a person to execute such order, the court shall give preference to a near relative or friend of the person with psychiatric disabilities, so far as the court deems it practicable and judicious. Notice of any action taken by the court shall be given to the respondent and his or her attorney, if any, in such manner as the court concludes would be appropriate under the circumstances.\n\n(d) If the respondent refuses to be examined by the court-appointed physicians as provided in subsection (c) of this section, the court may issue a warrant for the apprehension of the respondent and a police officer for the town in which such court is located or if there is no such police officer then the state police shall deliver the respondent to a general hospital where the respondent shall be examined by two physicians, one of whom shall be a practicing psychiatrist, in accordance with subsection (c) of this section. If as a result of such examination, the respondent is committed under section 17a-502 , transportation of the respondent to any such hospital, if such respondent is a female, shall be in accordance with the provisions of section 17a-505 . If the respondent is not committed under section 17a-502 , the respondent shall be released and the reports of such physicians shall be sent to the Probate Court to satisfy the requirement of examination by two physicians under subsection (c) of this section.\n\n(e) The respondent shall be given the opportunity to elect voluntary status under section 17a-506 at any time prior to adjudication of the application, subject to the following provisions: (1) In the event that a patient is in the hospital, the patient shall be informed by a member of the hospital staff within twenty-four hours prior to the time an application is filed with the court, that he or she may continue in the hospital on a voluntary basis under the provisions of section 17a-506 , and any application for involuntary commitment by the hospital shall include a statement that such voluntary status has been offered to the respondent and refused, and (2) in the event that a respondent is not hospitalized, the notice of hearing shall inform the respondent that the respondent has the right to enter the hospital on a voluntary basis under the provisions of section 17a-506 , and, if the respondent enters the hospital under section 17a-506 , the application for involuntary commitment shall be withdrawn. When any patient who has elected voluntary status following the filing of an application but prior to adjudication in any proceeding for involuntary commitment thereafter notifies the hospital that he or she wants to be released, a new application for involuntary commitment may be filed. If such new application is filed not later than forty-five days after the patient's election of voluntary status on a prior application, the application for involuntary commitment may, at the discretion of the judge, be heard on the merits, notwithstanding the patient's subsequent request to remain a voluntary patient under the provisions of section 17a-506 . Notwithstanding the provisions of sections 17a-29 , 17a-540 , 17a-543 , 17a-544 , subsection (f) of section 17a-547 and section 17a-548 , if a patient under section 17a-506 refuses to accept medication or treatment in accordance with the treatment plan prescribed by the attending physician and such patient is imminently dangerous to himself or others, an application for involuntary commitment may be filed for such patient in accordance with the provisions of this section.\n\n(f) The respondent shall be present at any hearing for his or her commitment under this section. If the respondent is medicated at that time, the hospital shall provide written notice to the court of such fact and of the common effects of such medication.\n\n(g) The hospital shall notify each patient at least annually that such patient has a right to a further hearing pursuant to this section. If the patient requests such hearing, it shall be held by the Probate Court for the district in which the hospital is located. Any such request shall be immediately filed with the appropriate court by the hospital. After such request is filed with the Probate Court, it shall proceed in the manner provided in subsections (a), (b), (c) and (f) of this section. In addition, the hospital shall furnish the Probate Court for the district in which the hospital is located on a monthly basis with a list of all patients confined in the hospital involuntarily without release for one year since the last annual review under this section of the patient's commitment or since the original commitment. The hospital shall include in such notification the type of review the patient last received. If the patient's last annual review had a hearing, the Probate Court shall, within fifteen business days thereafter, appoint an impartial physician who is a psychiatrist from the list provided by the Commissioner of Mental Health and Addiction Services as set forth in subsection (c) of this section and not connected with the hospital in which the patient is confined or related by blood or marriage to the original applicant or to the respondent, which physician shall see and examine each such patient within fifteen business days after such physician's appointment and make a report forthwith to such court of the condition of the patient on forms provided by the Probate Court Administrator. If the Probate Court concludes that the confinement of any such patient should be reviewed by such court for possible release of the patient, the court, on its own motion, shall proceed in the manner provided in subsections (a), (b), (c) and (f) of this section, except that the examining physician shall be considered one of the physicians required by subsection (c) of this section. If the patient's last annual review did not result in a hearing, and in any event at least every two years, the Probate Court shall, within fifteen business days, proceed with a hearing in the manner provided in subsections (a), (b), (c) and (f) of this section. All costs and expenses, including Probate Court entry fees provided by statute, in conjunction with the annual psychiatric review and the judicial review under this subsection, except costs for physicians appointed pursuant to this subsection, shall be established by, and paid from funds appropriated to, the Judicial Department, except that if funds have not been included in the budget of the Judicial Department for such costs and expenses, such payment shall be made from the Probate Court Administration Fund. Compensation of any physician appointed to conduct the annual psychiatric review, to examine a patient for any hearing held as a result of such annual review or for any other biennial hearing required pursuant to sections 17a-75 to 17a-83 , inclusive, 17a-450 to 17a-483 , inclusive, 17a-495 to 17a-528 , inclusive, 17a-540 to 17a-550 , inclusive, 17a-560 to 17a-575 , inclusive, and 17a-615 to 17a-618 , inclusive, shall be paid by the state from funds appropriated to the Department of Mental Health and Addiction Services in accordance with rates established by the Department of Mental Health and Addiction Services.\n\n(h) The rules of evidence applicable to civil matters in the Superior Court shall apply to hearings under this section.\n\nSee Sec. 17a-507 re admission to general hospital having psychiatric facilities."

If at the expiration of the fifteen days a written application for commitment of such person has not been filed, such person shall be discharged from the hospital. At the time of delivery of such person to such hospital, there shall be left, with the person in charge thereof, a certificate, signed by a physician licensed to practice medicine or surgery in Connecticut and dated not more than three days prior to its delivery to the person in charge of the hospital. Such certificate shall state the date of personal examination of the person to be confined, which shall be not more than three days prior to the date of signature of the certificate, shall state the findings of the physician relative to the physical and mental condition of the person and the history of the case, if known, and shall state that it is the opinion of the physician that the person examined has psychiatric disabilities and is dangerous to himself or herself or others or gravely disabled and is in need of immediate care and treatment in a hospital for psychiatric disabilities. Such physician shall state on such certificate the reasons for his or her opinion.\n\n(b) Any person admitted and detained under this section shall be examined by a physician specializing in psychiatry not later than forty-eight hours after admission as provided in section 17a-545 , except that any person admitted and detained under this section at a chronic disease hospital shall be so examined not later than thirty-six hours after admission. If such physician is of the opinion that the person does not meet the criteria for emergency detention and treatment, such person shall be immediately discharged. The physician shall enter the physician's findings in the patient's record.\n\n(c) Any person admitted and detained under this section shall be promptly informed by the admitting facility that such person has the right to consult an attorney, the right to a hearing under subsection (d) of this section, and that if such a hearing is requested or a probate application is filed, such person has the right to be represented by counsel, and that counsel will be provided at the state's expense if the person is unable to pay for such counsel. The reasonable compensation for counsel provided to persons unable to pay shall be established by, and paid from funds appropriated to, the Judicial Department, however, if funds have not been included in the budget of the Judicial Department for such purposes, such compensation shall be established by the Probate Court Administrator and paid from the Probate Court Administration Fund.\n\n(d) If any person detained under this section, or his or her representative, requests a hearing, in writing, such hearing shall be held within seventy-two hours of receipt of such request, excluding Saturdays, Sundays and holidays. At such hearing, the person shall have the right to be present, to cross-examine all witnesses testifying, and to be represented by counsel as provided in section 17a-498 . The hearing may be requested at any time prior to the initiation of proceedings under section 17a-498 . The hearing shall be held by the court of probate having jurisdiction for commitment as provided in section 17a-497 , and the hospital shall immediately notify such court of any request for a hearing by a person detained under this section. At the conclusion of the hearing, if the court finds that there is probable cause to conclude that the person is subject to involuntary confinement under this section, considering the condition of the respondent at the time of the admission and at the time of the hearing, and the effects of medication, if any, and the advisability of continued treatment based on testimony from the hospital staff, the court shall order that such person's detention continue for the remaining time provided for emergency certificates or until the completion of probate proceedings under section 17a-498 .\n\n(e) The person in charge of every private hospital for psychiatric disabilities in the state shall, on a quarterly basis, supply the Commissioner of Mental Health and Addiction Services, in writing with statistics that state for the preceding quarter, the number of admissions of type and the number of discharges for that facility. Said commissioner may adopt regulations to carry out the provisions of this subsection.\n\n(f) The superintendent or director of any hospital for psychiatric disabilities shall immediately discharge any patient admitted and detained under this section who is later found not to meet the standards for emergency detention and treatment.\n\n(g) Any person admitted and detained at any hospital for psychiatric disabilities under this section shall, upon admission to such hospital, furnish the name of his or her next of kin or close friend. The superintendent or director of such hospital shall notify such next of kin or close friend of the admission of such patient and the discharge of such patient, provided such patient consents, in writing, to such notification of his or her discharge.\n\n(h) No person, who a physician concludes has active suicidal or homicidal intent, may be admitted to or detained at a chronic disease hospital under an emergency certificate issued pursuant to this section, unless such chronic disease hospital is certified under Medicare as an acute care hospital with an inpatient prospective payment system excluded psychiatric unit."

All of the expenses in connection with an application filed under this section shall be paid by the applicant, unless the applicant is indigent or otherwise unable to pay such expenses, in which case such expenses shall be paid by the state from funds appropriated to the Department of Mental Health and Addiction Services, in accordance with rates established by the department, and attorney's fees shall be established by, and paid from funds appropriated to, the Judicial Department, except that if funds have not been included in the budget of the Judicial Department for such attorney's fees, such fees shall be established by the Probate Court Administrator and paid from the Probate Court Administration Fund, provided in no event shall the expenses be paid for any one applicant for more than two hearings in any one year, including the hearing provided for in subsection (g) of section 17a-498 . Such court may, for reasonable cause shown, order any person confined in a hospital for psychiatric disabilities to be removed to any other hospital for psychiatric disabilities in this state. If the officers, directors or trustees of a state hospital for psychiatric disabilities are notified by the superintendent of such hospital or other person in a managerial capacity that he or she has reason to believe that any person committed to such hospital by order of a Probate Court does not have psychiatric disabilities or is not a suitable subject to be confined in such hospital, or is appropriate for voluntary status, such officers, directors or trustees may discharge such person or convert the status of such person to voluntary status pursuant to section 17a-506 . The superintendent or other director of such hospital shall notify such person's next of kin or close friend of such person's discharge, provided such person consents in writing to such notification.\n\n(b) The rules of evidence applicable to civil matters in the Superior Court shall apply to hearings under this section.\n\nSee Sec. 17a-474 re release and transfer of inmates of humane institutions.\n\nSee Sec. 17a-523 re inquiry into whether person is wrongly confined."

The provisions of section 45a-649 concerning issuance of a citation and notice, personal service and representation by, appointment of, and compensation of an attorney shall apply to any petition filed under this subsection as if such patient were a respondent under section 45a-649 , except that (i) the court shall only be required to issue such citation and notice to the patient, the patient's attorney and any conservator appointed for the patient, and (ii) the court, in its discretion, may order notice as it directs to other persons having an interest in the patient and to such persons the patient requests to be notified. The Probate Court may appoint a special limited conservator with such specific authority pursuant to this subparagraph if the court finds by clear and convincing evidence that the patient is incapable of giving informed consent to medication for the treatment of the patient's psychiatric disabilities and such medication is necessary for the patient's treatment. The Probate Court may grant the special limited conservator specific authority to consent to the release of the patient's medical records to such facility if the court finds by clear and convincing evidence that the patient is unwilling or unable to release such records and such records are necessary to make decisions concerning the patient's treatment.\n\n(B) The special limited conservator shall meet with the patient and the physician, review the patient's written record and consider the risks and benefits from the medication, the likelihood and seriousness of adverse side effects, the preferences of the patient, the patient's religious views, and the prognosis with and without medication. After consideration of such information, the special limited conservator shall either consent to the patient receiving medication for the treatment of the patient's psychiatric disabilities or refuse to consent to the patient receiving such medication.\n\n(2) The authority of a special limited conservator to consent to the administration of medication under subdivision (1) of this subsection shall be effective for not more than one hundred twenty days. In the case of continuous hospitalization of the patient beyond such one hundred twenty days, if the head of the hospital and two qualified physicians determine that the patient continues to be incapable of giving informed consent to medication for the treatment of the patient's psychiatric disabilities and such medication is deemed to be necessary for the patient's treatment, the authority of the special limited conservator to consent to the administration of medication may be extended for a period not to exceed one hundred twenty days by order of the Probate Court without a hearing upon application by the head of the hospital. Prompt notice of the order shall be given to the patient, special limited conservator and facility.\n\n(3) The reasonable compensation of a special limited conservator appointed under this subsection shall be established by the Probate Court Administrator and paid from the Probate Court Administration Fund.\n\n(b) (1) If it is determined by the head of the hospital and two qualified physicians that (A) a patient who is a defendant placed in the custody of the Commissioner of Mental Health and Addiction Services pursuant to section 54-56d is capable of giving informed consent but refuses to consent to medication for treatment of the patient's psychiatric disabilities, (B) there is no less intrusive beneficial treatment, and (C) without medication, the psychiatric disabilities with which the patient has been diagnosed will continue unabated and place the patient or others in direct threat of harm, the facility in which the patient is placed may petition the probate court for the district in which such facility is located to authorize the administration to the patient of medication for the treatment of the patient's psychiatric disabilities, despite the refusal of the patient to consent to such medication. The provisions of section 45a-649 concerning issuance of a citation and notice, personal service and representation by, appointment of, and compensation of an attorney shall apply to any petition filed under this subsection as if such patient were a respondent under section 45a-649 , except that (i) the court shall only be required to issue such citation and notice to the patient, the patient's attorney and any conservator appointed for the patient, and (ii) the court, in its discretion, may order notice as it directs to other persons having an interest in the patient and to such persons the patient requests to be notified. The Probate Court may authorize the administration of medication to the patient if the court finds by clear and convincing evidence that (I) the patient is capable of giving informed consent but refuses to consent to medication for treatment of the patient's psychiatric disabilities, (II) there is no less intrusive beneficial treatment, and (III) without medication, the psychiatric disabilities with which the patient has been diagnosed will continue unabated and place the patient or others in direct threat of harm.\n\n(2) An order authorizing the administration of medication under subdivision (1) of this subsection shall be effective for not more than one hundred twenty days. In the case of continuous hospitalization of the patient beyond such one hundred twenty days, if the head of the hospital and two qualified physicians determine that (A) the patient continues to be capable of giving informed consent but refuses to consent to medication for treatment of the patient's psychiatric disabilities, (B) there is no less intrusive beneficial treatment, and (C) without medication, the psychiatric disabilities with which the patient has been diagnosed will continue unabated and place the patient or others in direct threat of harm, the order may be extended for a period not to exceed one hundred twenty days by order of the Probate Court without a hearing. Prompt notice of the order shall be given to the patient and facility.\n\n(c) Notwithstanding the provisions of subsections (a) and (b) of this section, if obtaining consent under this section would cause a medically harmful delay to a patient whose condition is of an extremely critical nature, as determined by the personal observation of a physician or the senior clinician on duty in the facility in which the patient is placed, the physician or senior clinician may order medication for treatment of the patient's psychiatric disabilities without consent.\n\n(d) Unless there is a serious risk of harm to the patient or others, based upon the patient's past history or current condition, nothing in this section authorizes any form of involuntary medical, psychological or psychiatric treatment of any patient who in the sincere practice of his or her religious beliefs is being treated by prayer alone in accordance with the principles and practices of a church or religious denomination by a duly accredited practitioner or ordained minister, priest or rabbi thereof.\n\n(e) Nothing in this section shall be construed to limit the application of sections 45a-644 to 45a-663 , inclusive, except as specifically provided in this section."

These rights shall be denied only if the superintendent, director or his or her authorized representative determines that it is medically harmful to the patient to exercise such rights. An explanation of such denial shall be placed in the patient's permanent clinical record.\n\n(b) In connection with any litigation related to hospitalization, or at any time following discharge from the facility, any patient or his or her attorney shall have the right, upon written request, to inspect all of such patient's hospital records, and to make copies thereof. Unless the request is made in connection with any litigation related to hospitalization, a mental health facility, as defined in subdivision (5) of section 52-146d , may refuse to disclose any portion of a patient's record which the mental health facility determines: (1) Would create a substantial risk that the patient would inflict life-threatening injury to self or to others or experience a severe deterioration in mental state; (2) would constitute an invasion of privacy of another person; or (3) would violate an assurance of confidentiality furnished to another person, provided only such portion of the record the disclosure of which would not constitute an invasion of privacy of another person or violate an assurance of confidentiality furnished to another person shall be disclosed. Any patient aggrieved by a facility's refusal to disclose under this subsection may petition the Superior Court for relief in the same manner as a patient proceeding under section 4-105 , except that in addition to notice and a hearing, the court may conduct an in camera review of the record. The court shall order disclosure of the record by such facility unless the court determines that the disclosure (A) would create a substantial risk that the patient would inflict life-threatening injury to self or to others or experience a severe deterioration in mental state, or (B) would constitute an invasion of privacy of another person, or (C) would violate an assurance of confidentiality furnished to another person, provided if the court orders disclosure of the record, only such portion of the record the disclosure of which would not constitute an invasion of privacy of another person or violate an assurance of confidentiality furnished to another person shall be disclosed.\n\n(c) A list of all in-hospital rights shall be prominently posted in each ward where mental health services are provided. Such list shall include, but not be limited to, the right to leave, as afforded by subsection (a) of section 17a-506 , the right to a hearing, as afforded by subsection (d) of section 17a-502 , and the right to file a complaint, as afforded by the hospital's complaint procedure.\n\n(d) Nothing in subsection (b) of this section shall limit a patient's right of access to his records under section 4-104 ."

Further, the party states find that the necessity of and desirability for furnishing such care and treatment bears no primary relation to the residence or citizenship of the patient but that, on the contrary, the controlling factors of community safety and humanitarianism require that facilities and services be made available for all who are in need of them. Consequently, it is the purpose of this compact and of the party states to provide the necessary legal basis for the institutionalization or other appropriate care and treatment of the mentally ill and mentally deficient under a system that recognizes the paramount importance of patient welfare and to establish the responsibilities of the party states in terms of such welfare.\n\nArticle II\n\nAs used in this compact:\n\n(a) “Sending state” shall mean a party state from which a patient is transported pursuant to the provisions of the compact or from which it is contemplated that a patient may be so sent.\n\n(b) “Receiving state” shall mean a party state to which a patient is transported pursuant to the provisions of the compact or to which it is contemplated that a patient may be so sent.\n\n(c) “Institution” shall mean any hospital or other facility maintained by a party state or political subdivision thereof for the care and treatment of mental illness or mental deficiency.\n\n(d) “Patient” shall mean any person subject to or eligible as determined by the laws of the sending state, for institutionalization or other care, treatment, or supervision pursuant to the provisions of this compact.\n\n(e) “Aftercare” shall mean care, treatment and services provided a patient, as defined herein, on convalescent status or conditional release.\n\n(f) “Mental illness” shall mean mental disease to such extent that a person so afflicted requires care and treatment for his own welfare, or the welfare of others, or of the community.\n\n(g) “Mental deficiency” shall mean mental deficiency as defined by appropriate clinical authorities to such extent that a person so afflicted is incapable of managing himself and his affairs, but shall not include mental illness as defined herein.\n\n(h) “State” shall mean any state, territory or possession of the United States, the District of Columbia, and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico.\n\nArticle III\n\n(a) Whenever a person physically present in any party state shall be in need of institutionalization by reason of mental illness or mental deficiency, he shall be eligible for care and treatment in an institution in that state irrespective of his residence, settlement or citizenship qualifications.\n\n(b) The provisions of paragraph (a) of this article to the contrary notwithstanding, any patient may be transferred to an institution in another state whenever there are factors based upon clinical determinations indicating that the care and treatment of said patient would be facilitated or improved thereby. Any such institutionalization may be for the entire period of care and treatment or for any portion or portions thereof. The factors referred to in this paragraph shall include the patient's full record with due regard for the location of the patient's family, character of the illness and probable duration thereof, and such other factors as shall be considered appropriate.\n\n(c) No state shall be obliged to receive any patient pursuant to the provisions of paragraph (b) of this article unless the sending state has given advance notice of its intention to send the patient; furnished all available medical and other pertinent records concerning the patient; given the qualified medical or other appropriate clinical authorities of the receiving state an opportunity to examine the patient if said authorities so wish; and unless the receiving state shall agree to accept the patient.\n\n(d) In the event that the laws of the receiving state establish a system of priorities for the admission of patients, an interstate patient under this compact shall receive the same priority as a local patient and shall be taken in the same order and at the same time that he would be taken if he were a local patient.\n\n(e) Pursuant to this compact, the determination as to the suitable place of institutionalization for a patient may be reviewed at any time and such interest of the patient.\n\nArticle IV\n\n(a) Whenever, pursuant to the laws of the state in which a patient is physically present, it shall be determined that the patient should receive aftercare or supervision, such care or supervision may be provided in a receiving state. If the medical or other appropriate clinical authorities having responsibility for the care and treatment of the patient in the sending state shall have reason to believe that aftercare in another state would be in the best interest of the patient and would not jeopardize the public safety, they shall request the appropriate authorities in the receiving state to investigate the desirability of affording the patient such aftercare in said receiving state, and such investigation shall be made with all reasonable speed. The request for investigation shall be accompanied by complete information concerning the patient's intended place of residence and the identity of the person in whose charge it is proposed to place the patient, the complete medical history of the patient, and such other documents as may be pertinent.\n\n(b) If the medical or other appropriate clinical authorities having responsibility for the care and treatment of the patient in the sending state and the appropriate authorities in the receiving state find that the best interest of the patient would be served thereby, and if the public safety would not be jeopardized thereby, the patient may receive aftercare or supervision in the receiving state.\n\n(c) In supervising, treating, or caring for a patient on aftercare pursuant to the terms of this article, a receiving state shall employ the same standards of visitation, examination, care and treatment that it employs for similar local patients.\n\nArticle V\n\nWhenever a dangerous or potentially dangerous patient escapes from an institution in any party state, that state shall promptly notify all appropriate authorities within and without the jurisdiction of the escape in a manner reasonably calculated to facilitate the speedy apprehension of the escapee. Immediately upon the apprehension and identification of any such dangerous or potentially dangerous patient, he shall be detained in the state where found pending disposition in accordance with law.\n\nArticle VI\n\nThe duly accredited officers of any state party to this compact, upon the establishment of their authority and the identity of the patient, shall be permitted to transport any patient being moved pursuant to this compact through any and all states party to this compact, without interference.\n\nArticle VII\n\n(a) No person shall be deemed a patient of more than one institution at any given time. Completion of transfer of any patient to an institution in a receiving state shall have the effect of making the person a patient of the institution in the receiving state.\n\n(b) The sending state shall pay all costs of and incidental to the transportation of any patient pursuant to this compact, but any two or more party states may, by making a specific agreement for that purpose, arrange for a different allocation of costs as among themselves.\n\n(c) No provision of this compact shall be construed to alter or affect any internal relationships among the departments, agencies and officers of and in the government of a party state, or between a party state and its subdivisions, as to the payment of costs, or responsibilities therefor.\n\n(d) Nothing in this compact shall be construed to prevent any party state or subdivision thereof from asserting any right against any person, agency or other entity in regard to costs for which such party state or subdivision thereof may be responsible pursuant to any provision of this compact.\n\n(e) Nothing in this compact shall be construed to invalidate any institutionalization, care or treatment of the mentally ill or mentally deficient, or any statutory authority pursuant to which such agreements may be made.\n\nArticle VIII\n\n(a) Nothing in this compact shall be construed to abridge, diminish, or in any way impair the rights, duties, and responsibilities of any patient's guardian on his own behalf or in respect of any patient for whom he may serve, except that where the transfer of any patient to another jurisdiction makes advisable the appointment of a supplemental or substitute guardian, any court of competent jurisdiction in the receiving state may make such supplemental or substitute appointment and the court which appointed the previous guardian shall upon being duly advised of the new appointment, and upon the satisfactory completion of such accounting and other acts as such court may by law require, relieve the previous guardian of power and responsibility to whatever extent shall be appropriate in the circumstances; provided, however, that in the case of any patient having settlement in the sending state, the court of competent jurisdiction in the sending state, which court in the State of Connecticut shall be the Superior Court, shall have sole discretion to relieve a guardian appointed by it or continue his power and responsibility, whichever it shall deem advisable. The court in the receiving state may, in its discretion, confirm or reappoint the person or persons previously serving as guardian in the sending state in lieu of making a supplemental or substitute appointment.\n\n(b) The term “guardian” as used in paragraph (a) of this article shall include any guardian, trustee, legal committee, conservator, or other person or agency however denominated who is charged by law with power to act for or responsibility for the person or property of a patient.\n\nArticle IX\n\n(a) No provision of this compact except Article V shall apply to any person institutionalized while under sentence in a penal or correctional institution or while subject to trial on a criminal charge, or whose institutionalization is due to the commission of an offense for which, in the absence of mental illness or mental deficiency, said person would be subject to incarceration in a penal or correctional institution.\n\n(b) To every extent possible, it shall be the policy of states party to this compact that no patient shall be placed or detained in any prison, jail or lockup, but such patient shall, with all expedition, be taken to a suitable institutional facility for mental illness or mental deficiency.\n\nArticle X\n\n(a) Each party state shall appoint a “compact administrator” who, on behalf of his state, shall act as general coordinator of activities under the compact in his state and who shall receive copies of all reports, correspondence, and other documents relating to any patient processed under the compact by his state either in the capacity of sending or receiving state. The compact administrator or his duly designated representative shall be the official with whom other party states shall deal in any matter relating to the compact or any patient processed thereunder.\n\n(b) The compact administrators of the respective party states shall have power to promulgate reasonable rules and regulations to carry out more effectively the terms and provisions of this compact.\n\nArticle XI\n\nThe duly constituted administrative authorities of any two or more party states may enter into supplementary agreements for the provision of any service or facility or for the maintenance of any institution on a joint or cooperative basis whenever the states concerned shall find that such agreements will improve services, facilities, or institutional care and treatment in the fields of mental illness or mental deficiency. No such supplementary agreement shall be construed so as to relieve any party state of any obligation which it otherwise would have under other provisions of this compact.\n\nArticle XII\n\nThis compact shall enter into full force and effect as to any state when enacted by it into law and such state shall thereafter be a party thereto with any and all states legally joining therein.\n\nArticle XIII\n\n(a) A state party to this compact may withdraw therefrom by enacting a statute repealing the same. Such withdrawal shall take effect one year after notice thereof has been communicated officially and in writing to the governors and compact administrators of all other party states. However, the withdrawal of any state shall not change the status of any patient who has been sent to said state or sent out of said state pursuant to the provisions of the compact.\n\n(b) Withdrawal from any agreement permitted by Article VII (b) as to costs or from any supplementary agreement made pursuant to Article XI shall be in accordance with the terms of such agreement.\n\nArticle XIV\n\nThis compact shall be liberally construed so as to effectuate the purposes thereof. The provisions of this compact shall be severable and if any phrase, clause, sentence or provision of this compact is declared to be contrary to the constitution of any party state or of the United States or the applicability thereof to any government, agency, person or circumstance is held invalid, the validity of the remainder of this compact and the applicability thereof to any government, agency, person or circumstance shall not be affected thereby. If this compact shall be held contrary to the constitution of any state party thereto, the compact shall remain in full force and effect as to the remaining states and in full force and effect as to the state affected as to all severable matters."

Any person, including the spouse, a relative or a conservator of a person sought to be committed, a physician issuing a certificate under subsection (b) of this section or the administrator of a treatment facility may make application to the Probate Court to commit a person to an inpatient treatment facility for treatment for alcohol dependency or drug dependency. The application shall be brought to the probate court for the district in which the respondent resides, or, if the respondent's residence is out of state or unknown, for the district in which he or she is at the time of filing the application. In any case in which the person is being treated in a facility, and an application is filed in accordance with the provisions of this section, jurisdiction shall be vested in the probate court for the district in which the facility where such person is a patient is located. If the respondent is confined to a facility, notwithstanding the provisions of section 45a-7 , the judge of probate for the district in which the application was filed shall hold the hearing on the application at the facility where such person is confined.",
              "(b) Contents of application and physician's certificate. Order for disclosure of medical information. The application shall allege that the person is an alcohol-dependent person or a drug-dependent person who is dangerous to himself or herself or dangerous to others when he or she is an intoxicated person or who is gravely disabled. The application shall contain a statement that the applicant has arranged for treatment in a treatment facility. A statement to that effect from such facility shall be attached to the application. At or before the hearing on the application, there shall be filed with the court a certificate of a licensed physician who has examined the person within two days before submission of the application. The physician's certificate shall set forth the physician's findings, including clinical observation or information, or the person's medical history, in support of the allegations of the application, and a finding of whether the person presently needs and is likely to benefit from treatment, and shall include a recommendation as to the type and length of treatment and inpatient facilities available for such treatment. A physician employed by the private treatment facility to which the person is to be committed is not eligible to be the certifying physician. An application filed by a person other than the certifying physician shall set forth the facts and information upon which the applicant bases his or her allegations and the names and addresses of all physicians. Upon the filing of an application under this section, the court may issue an order for the disclosure of the medical information required pursuant to this subsection.",
              "(c) Hearing date. Notice. Upon receipt of the application, the court shall assign a time for a hearing not later than seven business days after the date the application was filed. A copy of the application and physician's certificate and the notice of the hearing, shall be served, by a state marshal, constable or indifferent person not later than three business days before the hearing on the respondent, unless the respondent is in a facility, in which case such notice shall be by regular mail. Such notice shall inform such respondent that he or she has a right to be present at the hearing, that he or she has the right to counsel and, if indigent, to have counsel appointed to represent him or her, and that such respondent has a right to cross-examine witnesses testifying at any hearing upon that application. The court shall cause a recording of the testimony of such hearing to be made, to be transcribed only in the event of an appeal from the decree rendered pursuant to this section. A copy of such transcript shall be furnished without charge to any appellant whom the Court of Probate finds is unable to pay for the same. The cost of said transcript shall be paid from funds appropriated to the Judicial Department. The court shall cause notice of said hearing to be given by regular mail to the respondent's next of kin, a parent or legal guardian if the respondent is a minor, the administrator of the treatment facility if the respondent has been committed for emergency treatment pursuant to section 17a-684 , and the administrator of the treatment facility to which the respondent is to be admitted. The court may order such notice as it directs to other persons having an interest in the respondent. If the court finds such respondent is indigent or otherwise unable to pay for counsel, the court shall appoint counsel for such respondent, unless such respondent refuses counsel and the court finds that the respondent understands the nature of such refusal. The court shall appoint counsel for the respondent from a panel of attorneys admitted to practice in this state provided by the Probate Court Administrator in accordance with regulations promulgated by the Probate Court Administrator in accordance with section 45a-77 . The reasonable compensation of appointed counsel shall be established by, and paid from funds appropriated to, the Judicial Department. If funds have not been included in the budget of the Judicial Department for such purposes, such compensation shall be established by the Probate Court Administrator and paid from the Probate Court Administration Fund. Prior to such hearing such respondent, or the respondent's counsel, in accordance with the provisions of sections 52-146d to 52-146i , inclusive, shall be afforded access to all records, including without limitation, hospital records if such respondent is hospitalized, and shall be entitled to take notes therefrom. If such respondent is hospitalized at the time of the hearing, the hospital shall make available at such hearing for use by the respondent or the respondent's counsel all records in its possession relating to the condition of the respondent. Notwithstanding the provisions of sections 52-146d to 52-146i , inclusive, all such hospital records directly relating to the respondent shall be admissible at the request of any party or the Probate Court in any proceeding relating to the confinement to or release from a hospital or treatment facility. Nothing in this section shall prevent timely objections to the admissibility of evidence in accordance with the rules of civil procedure.",
              "(d) Commitment order. If, after hearing all relevant evidence, including the results of any diagnostic examination, the court finds, by clear and convincing evidence, that the respondent is an alcohol-dependent person or a drug-dependent person who is dangerous to himself or herself or dangerous to others when he or she is an intoxicated person or who is gravely disabled, it shall make an order of commitment to a treatment facility for inpatient treatment for a period of not less than thirty nor more than one hundred eighty days. The court may not order commitment of a respondent unless it determines that the treatment facility is able to provide adequate and appropriate treatment for such respondent and that the treatment is likely to be beneficial. In any proceeding pursuant to this subsection, the provisions of section 17a-686 shall apply.",
              "(e) Expiration of commitment period. A person committed under this section shall remain in the custody of the administrator of the treatment facility for inpatient treatment for the commitment period unless sooner discharged under the provisions of subsection (k) of this section by the administrator of the treatment facility. At the end of the commitment period, a person committed under this section shall be discharged automatically unless the administrator, before expiration of the period, obtains a court order for recommitment pursuant to the provisions of subsection (f) of this section for inpatient treatment. When the person is discharged, the administrator shall, if recommended by the medical officer of the facility, refer the person to an outpatient treatment facility for treatment pursuant to the provisions of subsection (j) of this section.",
              "(f) Application for recommitment. The administrator of an inpatient treatment facility, before expiration of the commitment period ordered in subsection (d) of this section, or the administrator of an outpatient treatment facility, before expiration of the outpatient treatment period set forth in subsection (j) of this section, may, on the advice of the medical officer of the facility, make application to the court for recommitment of the person to a treatment facility for inpatient treatment. An application for recommitment shall allege that the respondent is an alcohol-dependent person or a drug-dependent person who needs further inpatient treatment and is likely to benefit from such treatment, and, if the respondent is in an outpatient facility, that the respondent is not successfully participating in the outpatient program.",
              "(g) Recommitment hearing date. Notice. Upon the receipt of an application for recommitment under subsection (f) of this section, the court shall assign a time for hearing no later than ten business days after the date the application was filed.

The applicant shall be notified of the hearing date not later than three business days before the hearing.",
              "(h) Recommitment order. If after hearing all relevant evidence, including the results of any diagnostic examination, the court finds, by clear and convincing evidence, that the respondent is an alcohol-dependent person or a drug-dependent person who needs further inpatient treatment and who is likely to benefit from such treatment, and, if the respondent is in an outpatient treatment facility, that the respondent is not successfully participating in the outpatient program, it shall make an order of recommitment to an inpatient treatment facility for treatment for a period of not less than thirty nor more than one hundred eighty days. The court may not order recommitment of a respondent unless it determines that the treatment facility is able to provide adequate and appropriate treatment for such respondent and that the treatment is likely to be beneficial. The court shall not make more than one recommitment order immediately following an original commitment order under subsection (d) of this section nor more than one recommitment order from an outpatient treatment facility. In any proceeding pursuant to this subsection, the provisions of section 17a-686 shall apply.",
              "(i) Expiration of recommitment period. A person recommitted under subsection (h) of this section who has not been discharged before the end of the recommitment period shall be discharged automatically at the expiration of that period.

              "(j) Outpatient treatment after commitment or recommitment period. A person referred to an outpatient treatment facility pursuant to the provisions of subsection (e) or (i) of this section shall remain in outpatient treatment for a period of twelve months unless sooner discharged by the administrator of the treatment facility, on the advice of the medical officer of the facility, or unless, before expiration of the period of outpatient treatment, the administrator obtains a court order of recommitment for inpatient treatment as provided in subsection (h) of this section.",
              "(k) Discharge before expiration of commitment period. The administrator of a treatment facility, on the advice of the medical officer, shall discharge a person committed or recommitted for treatment at any time before the end of the period for which such person has been committed if the person is no longer an alcohol-dependent person or a drug-dependent person in need of further treatment, further treatment will not be likely to bring about significant improvement in the person's condition or treatment is no longer adequate or appropriate.",
              "(l) Application to terminate commitment. If a committed or recommitted person has not been discharged pursuant to subsection (k) of this section, any responsible person, including the committed or recommitted person, may make application to the Probate Court for termination of commitment or recommitment and discharge from the treatment facility. The application shall allege that the committed or recommitted person is no longer an alcohol-dependent person or a drug-dependent person in need of further treatment, that further treatment will not be likely to bring about significant improvement in the person's condition or that treatment is no longer adequate or appropriate. Upon receipt of any such application, such court shall assign a time, not later than ten business days thereafter, and a place for hearing such application, and shall cause reasonable notice thereof to be given to the applicant, the administrator of the treatment facility and any other person the court deems advisable. Such notice shall inform the applicant that he or she has the right to be present at the hearing and to present evidence at the hearing, that he or she has a right to counsel, that he or she, if indigent, has a right to have counsel appointed to represent him or her, and that such applicant has a right to cross-examine witnesses at any hearing on such application. The provisions of section 17a-686 shall apply. If, after hearing, the court determines that the grounds alleged in the application exist, it shall order termination of the commitment or recommitment and discharge of the committed or recommitted person, except that the court may not order the discharge of an alcohol-dependent person or drug-dependent person who the court determines is likely to become dangerous to himself or herself or dangerous to others when he is an intoxicated person.",
              "(m) Temporary leave from treatment facility. The administrator of a treatment facility to which a committed or recommitted person has been committed or recommitted may, under such restrictions or agreements as the administrator deems advisable and on the advice of the medical officer of the facility, permit the person to leave the treatment facility temporarily, in the charge of such person's guardian, conservator, relatives or friends, or by himself or herself.",
              "(n) Expenses. All the expenses in connection with an application filed under sections 17a-684 to 17a-686 , inclusive, shall be paid by the applicant, unless the applicant is indigent, in which case such expenses shall be paid by the state from funds appropriated to the Department of Mental Health and Addiction Services in accordance with rates established by said department, and attorney's fees shall be established by, and paid from funds appropriated to, the Judicial Department. If funds have not been included in the budget of the Judicial Department for such attorney's fees, such fees shall be established by the Probate Court Administrator and paid from the Probate Court Administration Fund, provided in no event shall the expenses under subsection (l) of this section be paid for any one applicant for more than two hearings per year."

Any person, including the spouse, a relative or a conservator of a person sought to be committed, a physician issuing a certificate under subsection (b) of this section or the administrator of a treatment facility may make application to the Probate Court to commit a person to an inpatient treatment facility for treatment for alcohol dependency or drug dependency. The application shall be brought to the probate court for the district in which the respondent resides, or, if the respondent's residence is out of state or unknown, for the district in which he or she is at the time of filing the application. In any case in which the person is being treated in a facility, and an application is filed in accordance with the provisions of this section, jurisdiction shall be vested in the probate court for the district in which the facility where such person is a patient is located. If the respondent is confined to a facility, notwithstanding the provisions of section 45a-7 , the judge of probate for the district in which the application was filed shall hold the hearing on the application at the facility where such person is confined.\n\n(b) Contents of application and physician's certificate. Order for disclosure of medical information. The application shall allege that the person is an alcohol-dependent person or a drug-dependent person who is dangerous to himself or herself or dangerous to others when he or she is an intoxicated person or who is gravely disabled. The application shall contain a statement that the applicant has arranged for treatment in a treatment facility. A statement to that effect from such facility shall be attached to the application. At or before the hearing on the application, there shall be filed with the court a certificate of a licensed physician who has examined the person within two days before submission of the application. The physician's certificate shall set forth the physician's findings, including clinical observation or information, or the person's medical history, in support of the allegations of the application, and a finding of whether the person presently needs and is likely to benefit from treatment, and shall include a recommendation as to the type and length of treatment and inpatient facilities available for such treatment. A physician employed by the private treatment facility to which the person is to be committed is not eligible to be the certifying physician. An application filed by a person other than the certifying physician shall set forth the facts and information upon which the applicant bases his or her allegations and the names and addresses of all physicians. Upon the filing of an application under this section, the court may issue an order for the disclosure of the medical information required pursuant to this subsection.\n\n(c) Hearing date. Notice. Upon receipt of the application, the court shall assign a time for a hearing not later than seven business days after the date the application was filed. A copy of the application and physician's certificate and the notice of the hearing, shall be served, by a state marshal, constable or indifferent person not later than three business days before the hearing on the respondent, unless the respondent is in a facility, in which case such notice shall be by regular mail. Such notice shall inform such respondent that he or she has a right to be present at the hearing, that he or she has the right to counsel and, if indigent, to have counsel appointed to represent him or her, and that such respondent has a right to cross-examine witnesses testifying at any hearing upon that application. The court shall cause a recording of the testimony of such hearing to be made, to be transcribed only in the event of an appeal from the decree rendered pursuant to this section. A copy of such transcript shall be furnished without charge to any appellant whom the Court of Probate finds is unable to pay for the same. The cost of said transcript shall be paid from funds appropriated to the Judicial Department. The court shall cause notice of said hearing to be given by regular mail to the respondent's next of kin, a parent or legal guardian if the respondent is a minor, the administrator of the treatment facility if the respondent has been committed for emergency treatment pursuant to section 17a-684 , and the administrator of the treatment facility to which the respondent is to be admitted. The court may order such notice as it directs to other persons having an interest in the respondent. If the court finds such respondent is indigent or otherwise unable to pay for counsel, the court shall appoint counsel for such respondent, unless such respondent refuses counsel and the court finds that the respondent understands the nature of such refusal. The court shall appoint counsel for the respondent from a panel of attorneys admitted to practice in this state provided by the Probate Court Administrator in accordance with regulations promulgated by the Probate Court Administrator in accordance with section 45a-77 . The reasonable compensation of appointed counsel shall be established by, and paid from funds appropriated to, the Judicial Department. If funds have not been included in the budget of the Judicial Department for such purposes, such compensation shall be established by the Probate Court Administrator and paid from the Probate Court Administration Fund. Prior to such hearing such respondent, or the respondent's counsel, in accordance with the provisions of sections 52-146d to 52-146i , inclusive, shall be afforded access to all records, including without limitation, hospital records if such respondent is hospitalized, and shall be entitled to take notes therefrom. If such respondent is hospitalized at the time of the hearing, the hospital shall make available at such hearing for use by the respondent or the respondent's counsel all records in its possession relating to the condition of the respondent. Notwithstanding the provisions of sections 52-146d to 52-146i , inclusive, all such hospital records directly relating to the respondent shall be admissible at the request of any party or the Probate Court in any proceeding relating to the confinement to or release from a hospital or treatment facility. Nothing in this section shall prevent timely objections to the admissibility of evidence in accordance with the rules of civil procedure.\n\n(d) Commitment order. If, after hearing all relevant evidence, including the results of any diagnostic examination, the court finds, by clear and convincing evidence, that the respondent is an alcohol-dependent person or a drug-dependent person who is dangerous to himself or herself or dangerous to others when he or she is an intoxicated person or who is gravely disabled, it shall make an order of commitment to a treatment facility for inpatient treatment for a period of not less than thirty nor more than one hundred eighty days. The court may not order commitment of a respondent unless it determines that the treatment facility is able to provide adequate and appropriate treatment for such respondent and that the treatment is likely to be beneficial. In any proceeding pursuant to this subsection, the provisions of section 17a-686 shall apply.\n\n(e) Expiration of commitment period. A person committed under this section shall remain in the custody of the administrator of the treatment facility for inpatient treatment for the commitment period unless sooner discharged under the provisions of subsection (k) of this section by the administrator of the treatment facility. At the end of the commitment period, a person committed under this section shall be discharged automatically unless the administrator, before expiration of the period, obtains a court order for recommitment pursuant to the provisions of subsection (f) of this section for inpatient treatment. When the person is discharged, the administrator shall, if recommended by the medical officer of the facility, refer the person to an outpatient treatment facility for treatment pursuant to the provisions of subsection (j) of this section.\n\n(f) Application for recommitment. The administrator of an inpatient treatment facility, before expiration of the commitment period ordered in subsection (d) of this section, or the administrator of an outpatient treatment facility, before expiration of the outpatient treatment period set forth in subsection (j) of this section, may, on the advice of the medical officer of the facility, make application to the court for recommitment of the person to a treatment facility for inpatient treatment. An application for recommitment shall allege that the respondent is an alcohol-dependent person or a drug-dependent person who needs further inpatient treatment and is likely to benefit from such treatment, and, if the respondent is in an outpatient facility, that the respondent is not successfully participating in the outpatient program.\n\n(g) Recommitment hearing date. Notice. Upon the receipt of an application for recommitment under subsection (f) of this section, the court shall assign a time for hearing no later than ten business days after the date the application was filed. A copy of the application and of the notice of the hearing, including the date fixed by the court, shall be sent by regular mail at least seven days before the hearing, to the respondent, the respondent's next of kin, the original applicant under subsection (a) of this section if different from the applicant for recommitment, the respondent's parents or legal guardian if the respondent is a minor, the administrator of the treatment facility to which the respondent is admitted or to be admitted and any other person the court believes advisable. The applicant shall be notified of the hearing date not later than three business days before the hearing.\n\n(h) Recommitment order. If after hearing all relevant evidence, including the results of any diagnostic examination, the court finds, by clear and convincing evidence, that the respondent is an alcohol-dependent person or a drug-dependent person who needs further inpatient treatment and who is likely to benefit from such treatment, and, if the respondent is in an outpatient treatment facility, that the respondent is not successfully participating in the outpatient program, it shall make an order of recommitment to an inpatient treatment facility for treatment for a period of not less than thirty nor more than one hundred eighty days. The court may not order recommitment of a respondent unless it determines that the treatment facility is able to provide adequate and appropriate treatment for such respondent and that the treatment is likely to be beneficial. The court shall not make more than one recommitment order immediately following an original commitment order under subsection (d) of this section nor more than one recommitment order from an outpatient treatment facility. In any proceeding pursuant to this subsection, the provisions of section 17a-686 shall apply.\n\n(i) Expiration of recommitment period. A person recommitted under subsection (h) of this section who has not been discharged before the end of the recommitment period shall be discharged automatically at the expiration of that period. When the recommitted person is discharged, the administrator of the treatment facility shall, if advised to do so by the medical officer of the facility, refer the person to an outpatient treatment facility for treatment pursuant to the provisions of subsection (j) of this section.\n\n(j) Outpatient treatment after commitment or recommitment period. A person referred to an outpatient treatment facility pursuant to the provisions of subsection (e) or (i) of this section shall remain in outpatient treatment for a period of twelve months unless sooner discharged by the administrator of the treatment facility, on the advice of the medical officer of the facility, or unless, before expiration of the period of outpatient treatment, the administrator obtains a court order of recommitment for inpatient treatment as provided in subsection (h) of this section.\n\n(k) Discharge before expiration of commitment period. The administrator of a treatment facility, on the advice of the medical officer, shall discharge a person committed or recommitted for treatment at any time before the end of the period for which such person has been committed if the person is no longer an alcohol-dependent person or a drug-dependent person in need of further treatment, further treatment will not be likely to bring about significant improvement in the person's condition or treatment is no longer adequate or appropriate.\n\n(l) Application to terminate commitment. If a committed or recommitted person has not been discharged pursuant to subsection (k) of this section, any responsible person, including the committed or recommitted person, may make application to the Probate Court for termination of commitment or recommitment and discharge from the treatment facility. The application shall allege that the committed or recommitted person is no longer an alcohol-dependent person or a drug-dependent person in need of further treatment, that further treatment will not be likely to bring about significant improvement in the person's condition or that treatment is no longer adequate or appropriate. Upon receipt of any such application, such court shall assign a time, not later than ten business days thereafter, and a place for hearing such application, and shall cause reasonable notice thereof to be given to the applicant, the administrator of the treatment facility and any other person the court deems advisable. Such notice shall inform the applicant that he or she has the right to be present at the hearing and to present evidence at the hearing, that he or she has a right to counsel, that he or she, if indigent, has a right to have counsel appointed to represent him or her, and that such applicant has a right to cross-examine witnesses at any hearing on such application. The provisions of section 17a-686 shall apply. If, after hearing, the court determines that the grounds alleged in the application exist, it shall order termination of the commitment or recommitment and discharge of the committed or recommitted person, except that the court may not order the discharge of an alcohol-dependent person or drug-dependent person who the court determines is likely to become dangerous to himself or herself or dangerous to others when he is an intoxicated person.\n\n(m) Temporary leave from treatment facility. The administrator of a treatment facility to which a committed or recommitted person has been committed or recommitted may, under such restrictions or agreements as the administrator deems advisable and on the advice of the medical officer of the facility, permit the person to leave the treatment facility temporarily, in the charge of such person's guardian, conservator, relatives or friends, or by himself or herself.\n\n(n) Expenses. All the expenses in connection with an application filed under sections 17a-684 to 17a-686 , inclusive, shall be paid by the applicant, unless the applicant is indigent, in which case such expenses shall be paid by the state from funds appropriated to the Department of Mental Health and Addiction Services in accordance with rates established by said department, and attorney's fees shall be established by, and paid from funds appropriated to, the Judicial Department. If funds have not been included in the budget of the Judicial Department for such attorney's fees, such fees shall be established by the Probate Court Administrator and paid from the Probate Court Administration Fund, provided in no event shall the expenses under subsection (l) of this section be paid for any one applicant for more than two hearings per year."

Upon the petition of any parent or guardian of a child who is blind or visually impaired, a local board of education may provide such instruction within the town or it may provide for such instruction by agreement with other towns as provided in subsection (d) of section 10-76d . All educational privileges prescribed in part V of chapter 164, not inconsistent with the provisions of this chapter, shall apply to the pupils covered by this subsection.\n\n(b) The Commissioner of Aging and Disability Services shall expend funds for the services made available pursuant to subsection (a) of this section from the educational aid for children who are blind or visually impaired account in accordance with the provisions of this subsection. The Commissioner of Aging and Disability Services may adopt, in accordance with the provisions of chapter 54, such regulations as the commissioner deems necessary to carry out the purpose and intent of this subsection.\n\n(1) The Commissioner of Aging and Disability Services shall provide, upon written request from any interested school district, the services of teachers who instruct students who are visually impaired, based on the levels established in the individualized education or service plan. The Commissioner of Aging and Disability Services shall also make available resources, including, but not limited to, the braille and large print library, to all teachers of public and nonpublic school children. The commissioner may also provide vision-related professional development and training to all school districts and cover the actual cost for paraeducators from school districts to participate in agency-sponsored braille training programs. The commissioner shall utilize education consultant positions, funded by moneys appropriated from the General Fund, to supplement new staffing that will be made available through the educational aid for children who are blind or visually impaired account, which shall be governed by formal written policies established by the commissioner.\n\n(2) The Commissioner of Aging and Disability Services may use funds appropriated to said account to provide specialized books, materials, equipment, supplies, adaptive technology services and devices, specialist examinations and aids, preschool programs and vision-related independent living services, excluding primary educational placement, for eligible children.\n\n(3) The Commissioner of Aging and Disability Services may, within available appropriations, employ certified teachers who instruct students who are visually impaired in sufficient numbers to meet the requests for services received from school districts. In responding to such requests, the commissioner shall utilize a formula for determining the number of teachers needed to serve the school districts, crediting six points for each child learning braille and one point for each other child, with one full-time certified teacher who instructs students who are visually impaired assigned for every twenty-five points credited. The commissioner shall exercise due diligence to employ the needed number of certified teachers who instruct students who are visually impaired, but shall not be liable for lack of resources. Funds appropriated to said account may also be utilized to employ additional staff in numbers sufficient to provide compensatory skills, evaluations and training to children who are blind or visually impaired, special assistants and other support staff necessary to ensure the efficient operation of service delivery. Not later than October first of each year, the Commissioner of Aging and Disability Services shall determine the number of teachers needed based on the formula provided in this subdivision. Based on such determination, the Commissioner of Aging and Disability Services shall estimate the funding needed to pay such teachers' salaries and related expenses.\n\n(4) In any fiscal year, when funds appropriated to cover the combined costs associated with providing the services set forth in subdivisions (2) and (3) of this subsection are projected to be insufficient, the Commissioner of Aging and Disability Services may collect revenue from all school districts that have requested such services on a per student pro rata basis, in the sums necessary to cover the projected portion of these services for which there are insufficient appropriations.\n\n(c) The Commissioner of Aging and Disability Services may provide for the instruction of adults who are blind in their homes, expending annually for this purpose such sums as the General Assembly may appropriate.\n\n(d) The Commissioner of Aging and Disability Services may expend up to ten thousand dollars per fiscal year per person twenty-one years of age or older who is both blind or visually impaired and deaf, in addition to any other expenditures for such person, for the purpose of providing community inclusion services through specialized public and private entities from which such person can benefit.
