With the exception of two public members, the members appointed by the Governor shall be appointed from nominees of the Commissioner of Emergency Services and Public Protection, the Commissioner of Mental Health and Addiction Services, the Connecticut State Association of Chiefs of Police, the Commissioner of Energy and Environmental Protection, The Connecticut State Rifle and Revolver Association, Inc., and Ye Connecticut Gun Guild, Inc., and each of said organizations shall be entitled to representation on the board.

On such appeal the board shall inquire into and determine the facts, de novo, and unless it finds that such a refusal, limitation or revocation, or such refusal or failure to supply an application, as the case may be, would be for just and proper cause, it shall order such permit or certificate to be issued, renewed or restored, or the limitation removed or modified, as the case may be. If the refusal was for failure to document compliance with local zoning requirements, under subsection (a) of section 29-28 , the board shall not issue a permit.\n\n(c) Any person aggrieved by the action of an issuing authority may file with the board a clear and concise statement of the facts on which such person relies for relief, and shall state the relief sought by the appellant. The receipt by the board of the appellant's statement shall initiate the appeals process, and no appeal may be rejected for mere lack of formality.

The failure, absent good cause shown, or refusal of the issuing authority to furnish such written statement, or to supply the appellant with an application, at least ten days prior to the hearing shall be cause for the board to grant the relief sought, forthwith and without further hearing. If the issuing authority shows good cause for its failure to furnish such written statement, the board shall continue the matter to the next scheduled meeting of the board, provided the issuing authority shall be allowed only one such continuance.\n\n(d) The board shall hold hearings at such times and places as it in its discretion reasonably determines to be required, but not less than once every ninety days, and shall give reasonable notice of the time and place of the hearing to the appellant and to the issuing authority.

Such person, firm or corporation shall ensure that all questions on the application are answered properly prior to releasing the pistol or revolver and shall retain the application, which shall be attached to the federal sale or transfer document, for at least twenty years or until such vendor goes out of business. Such application shall be available for inspection during normal business hours by law enforcement officials. No sale, delivery or other transfer of any pistol or revolver shall be made unless the person making the purchase or to whom the same is delivered or transferred is personally known to the person selling such pistol or revolver or making delivery or transfer thereof or provides evidence of his identity in the form of a motor vehicle operator's license, identity card issued pursuant to section 1-1h or valid passport. No sale, delivery or other transfer of any pistol or revolver shall be made until the person, firm or corporation making such transfer obtains an authorization number from the Commissioner of Emergency Services and Public Protection. Said commissioner shall perform the national instant criminal background check and make a reasonable effort to determine whether there is any reason that would prohibit such applicant from possessing a pistol or revolver as provided in section 53a-217c .

No pistol or revolver shall be loaded or contain therein any gunpowder or other explosive or any bullet, ball or shell when such pistol or revolver is sold, delivered or otherwise transferred.\n\n(e) Upon the sale, delivery or other transfer of any pistol or revolver, the person making the purchase or to whom the same is delivered or transferred shall sign a receipt for such pistol or revolver, which shall contain the name and address of such person, the date of sale, the caliber, make, model and manufacturer's number and a general description of such pistol or revolver, the identification number of such person's permit to carry pistols or revolvers, issued pursuant to subsection (b) of section 29-28 , permit to sell firearms at retail, issued pursuant to subsection (a) of said section, or eligibility certificate for a pistol or revolver, issued pursuant to section 29-36f , if any, and the authorization number designated for the transfer by the Department of Emergency Services and Public Protection.

The court shall not order suspension of prosecution unless the accused person has acknowledged that he understands the consequences of the suspension of prosecution. Any person for whom prosecution is suspended shall agree to the tolling of any statute of limitations with respect to such violation and to a waiver of his right to a speedy trial. Such person shall appear in court and shall be released to the supervision of the Court Support Services Division for such period, not exceeding two years, and under such conditions as the court shall order. If the person refuses to accept, or, having accepted, violates such conditions, the court shall terminate the suspension of prosecution and the case shall be brought to trial. If such person satisfactorily completes his period of probation, he may apply for dismissal of the charges against him and the court, on finding such satisfactory completion, shall dismiss such charges. If the person does not apply for dismissal of the charges against him after satisfactorily completing his period of probation, the court, upon receipt of a report submitted by the Court Support Services Division that the person satisfactorily completed his period of probation, may on its own motion make a finding of such satisfactory completion and dismiss such charges. Upon dismissal, all records of such charges shall be erased pursuant to section 54-142a . An order of the court denying a motion to dismiss the charges against a person who has completed his period of probation or terminating the participation of a defendant in such program shall be a final judgment for purposes of appeal.\n\n(j) Any person who violates any provision of this section shall be guilty of a class C felony for which two years of the sentence imposed may not be suspended or reduced by the court, and five thousand dollars of the fine imposed may not be remitted or reduced by the court unless the court states on the record its reasons for remitting or reducing such fine, except that any person who sells, delivers or otherwise transfers a pistol or revolver in violation of the provisions of this section knowing that such pistol or revolver is stolen or that the manufacturer's number or other mark of identification on such pistol or revolver has been altered, removed or obliterated, shall be guilty of a class B felony for which three years of the sentence imposed may not be suspended or reduced by the court, and ten thousand dollars of the fine imposed may not be remitted or reduced by the court unless the court states on the record its reasons for remitting or reducing such fine, and any pistol or revolver found in the possession of any person in violation of any provision of this section shall be forfeited."

Evidence presented at trial was insufficient to support conviction of carrying pistol without a license because state did not prove beyond a reasonable doubt that gun barrel was less than 12 inches in length. 48 CA 193. State's search of state and city database for evidence of permit to carry pistol was insufficient to meet state's burden of establishing that defendant lacked a valid permit to lawfully carry a pistol on date of incident because state failed to establish that defendant was a resident of the city or had a place of business within the city during the 60-day period immediately preceding the alleged conduct. 156 CA 175; judgment reversed in part, see 324 C. 782. Section is designed to prohibit the carrying of a pistol without a permit and not the mere possession of one; constructive possession of a pistol will not suffice to support a conviction under section; to establish that a defendant carried a pistol or revolver, the state must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that he bore a pistol or revolver upon his person while exercising dominion or control of it; because there is no temporal requirement in section, and no requirement that the pistol or revolver be moved from one place to another to prove that it was carried, a defendant can be shown to have carried a pistol or revolver upon his person, within the meaning of section, by evidence proving, inter alia, that he grasped or held it in his hands, arms or clothing or otherwise bore it upon his body for any period of time while maintaining dominion or control over it. 184 CA 332; judgment affirmed, see 335 C. 212."

For the purposes of this subsection, “antique firearm” means any firearm which was manufactured in or before 1898 and any replica of such firearm, provided such replica is not designed or redesigned for using rimfire or conventional centerfire fixed ammunition except rimfire or conventional centerfire fixed ammunition which is no longer manufactured in the United States and not readily available in the ordinary channel of commercial trade.\n\n(h) The provisions of subsections (c) to (g), inclusive, of this section shall not apply to the sale, delivery or transfer of (1) long guns to (A) the Department of Emergency Services and Public Protection, police departments, the Department of Correction, the Division of Criminal Justice, the Department of Motor Vehicles, the Department of Energy and Environmental Protection or the military or naval forces of this state or of the United States, (B) a sworn and duly certified member of an organized police department, the Division of State Police within the Department of Emergency Services and Public Protection or the Department of Correction, a chief inspector or inspector in the Division of Criminal Justice, a salaried inspector of motor vehicles designated by the Commissioner of Motor Vehicles, a conservation officer or special conservation officer appointed by the Commissioner of Energy and Environmental Protection pursuant to section 26-5 , or a constable who is certified by the Police Officer Standards and Training Council and appointed by the chief executive authority of a town, city or borough to perform criminal law enforcement duties, pursuant to a letter on the letterhead of such department, division, commissioner or authority authorizing the purchase and stating that the sworn member, inspector, officer or constable will use the long gun in the discharge of official duties, and that a records check indicates that the sworn member, inspector, officer or constable has not been convicted of a crime of family violence, for use by such sworn member, inspector, officer or constable in the discharge of such sworn member's, inspector's, officer's or constable's official duties or when off duty, (C) a member of the military or naval forces of this state or of the United States, or (D) a nuclear facility licensed by the United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission for the purpose of providing security services at such facility, or any contractor or subcontractor of such facility for the purpose of providing security services at such facility; (2) long guns to or between federally licensed firearm manufacturers, importers or dealers; (3) curios or relics, as defined in 27 CFR 478.11, to or between federally licensed firearm collectors; or (4) antique firearms, as defined in subsection (g) of this section.\n\n(i) If the court finds that a violation of this section is not of a serious nature and that the person charged with such violation (1) will probably not offend in the future, (2) has not previously been convicted of a violation of this section, and (3) has not previously had a prosecution under this section suspended pursuant to this subsection, it may order suspension of prosecution. The court shall not order suspension of prosecution unless the accused person has acknowledged that he understands the consequences of the suspension of prosecution. Any person for whom prosecution is suspended shall agree to the tolling of any statute of limitations with respect to such violation and to a waiver of his right to a speedy trial. Such person shall appear in court and shall be released to the supervision of the Court Support Services Division for such period, not exceeding two years, and under such conditions as the court shall order. If the person refuses to accept, or, having accepted, violates such conditions, the court shall terminate the suspension of prosecution and the case shall be brought to trial. If such person satisfactorily completes his period of probation, he may apply for dismissal of the charges against him and the court, on finding such satisfactory completion, shall dismiss such charges. If the person does not apply for dismissal of the charges against him after satisfactorily completing his period of probation, the court, upon receipt of a report submitted by the Court Support Services Division that the person satisfactorily completed his period of probation, may on its own motion make a finding of such satisfactory completion and dismiss such charges. Upon dismissal, all records of such charges shall be erased pursuant to section 54-142a . An order of the court denying a motion to dismiss the charges against a person who has completed his period of probation or terminating the participation of a defendant in such program shall be a final judgment for purposes of appeal.\n\n(j) Any person who violates any provision of this section shall be guilty of a class D felony, except that any person who sells, delivers or otherwise transfers a long gun in violation of the provisions of this section, knowing that such long gun is stolen or that the manufacturer's number or other mark of identification on such long gun has been altered, removed or obliterated, shall be guilty of a class B felony, and any long gun found in the possession of any person in violation of any provision of this section shall be forfeited."

No finding of probable cause may be found solely because the petitioner is subject to an existing risk protection order or warrant. If the law enforcement agency finds no probable cause, the agency shall so notify the court which shall cancel the hearing and terminate the order and warrant, if applicable. If the law enforcement agency finds probable cause, the agency shall notify the court of such finding and the hearing shall proceed as scheduled.

The judge hearing the matter may exclude from the room in which such hearing is held any person whose presence, in the court's opinion, is not necessary pursuant to subsection (b) of section 46b-122 . At such hearing, the state shall have the burden of proving all material facts by clear and convincing evidence. If, after such hearing, the court finds by clear and convincing evidence that the child poses a risk of imminent personal injury to another person, the court may order that the firearm or firearms or other deadly weapon or deadly weapons and any ammunition seized pursuant to the warrant issued under subsection (a) of this section continue to be held by the state until further order of the court.",

A copy of the warrant shall be served upon the child and the child's parent or guardian named in the warrant not later than three days before the hearing scheduled pursuant to subsection (e) of this section, together with a notice informing the child and the child's parent or guardian that such child has the right to a hearing and the right to be represented by counsel at the hearing. If the child and the child's parent or guardian are unable to afford counsel, counsel shall be appointed on behalf of the child if determined indigent and eligible in accordance with the provisions of chapter 887 for the purposes of proceedings pursuant to this section in the juvenile court.\n\n(d) The municipal or state police agency that executed the warrant shall file a copy of the application for the warrant and all affidavits upon which the warrant is based with the clerk of the juvenile court serving the town where the child resides and with the assistant state's attorney's office for such juvenile court not later than the next business day following the execution of the warrant. The clerk of the juvenile court shall not disclose any information pertaining to the application for the warrant or any affidavits upon which the warrant is based. The warrant shall be executed and returned with reasonable promptness consistent with due process of law and shall be accompanied by a written inventory of all firearms and other deadly weapons and ammunition seized.\n\n(e) Not later than fourteen days after the issuance of a warrant under this section, the juvenile court serving the town where the child named in the risk warrant resides shall hold a hearing to determine whether the firearm or firearms or other deadly weapon or deadly weapons and ammunition should be returned to the rightful owner of any such firearm, deadly weapon or ammunition, or, if the state should continue to hold any such firearm, deadly weapon or ammunition. The judge hearing the matter may exclude from the room in which such hearing is held any person whose presence, in the court's opinion, is not necessary pursuant to subsection (b) of section 46b-122 . At such hearing, the state shall have the burden of proving all material facts by clear and convincing evidence. If, after such hearing, the court finds by clear and convincing evidence that the child poses a risk of imminent personal injury to another person, the court may order that the firearm or firearms or other deadly weapon or deadly weapons and any ammunition seized pursuant to the warrant issued under subsection (a) of this section continue to be held by the state until further order of the court.\n\n(f) If the court finds that the state has failed to prove by clear and convincing evidence that the child poses a risk of imminent personal injury to another person and that the child possesses one or more firearms or deadly weapons, the court shall order the firearm or firearms or other deadly weapon or deadly weapons and any ammunition seized to be returned as soon as is practicable to the rightful owner of any such firearm, deadly weapon or ammunition, provided such owner is otherwise legally eligible to possess such items.\n\n(g) For the purposes of this section, “ammunition”, “family or household member” and “medical professional” have the same meanings as provided in subsection (j) of section 29-38c and “deadly weapon” has the same meaning as provided in section 53a-3 ."

Such form may require the disclosure of any information necessary for the commissioner to determine whether the instructor's suitability to serve as an instructor has changed since the issuance of the prior approval. The term of such renewed approval shall not exceed two years.\n\n(c) Not later than two years after successful completion of the training required pursuant to subsection (b) of this section, or the waiver of such training, the applicant may submit an application for a license as a security officer on forms furnished by the commissioner and, under oath, shall give the applicant's name, address, date and place of birth, employment for the previous five years, experience in the position applied for, including military training and weapons qualifications, any convictions for violations of the law and such other information as the commissioner may require, by regulation, to properly investigate the character, competency and integrity of the applicant. The commissioner shall require any applicant for a license, or for renewal of a license, under this section to submit to state and national criminal history records checks conducted in accordance with section 29-17a , provided an applicant for renewal of a license shall not be charged any fee pursuant to subsection (c) of section 29-11 for such records checks. Each applicant shall submit with the application (1) two sets of his or her fingerprints on forms specified and furnished by the commissioner, provided an applicant for renewal of a license need not submit such sets of fingerprints, (2) two full-face photographs, two inches wide by two inches high, taken not earlier than six months prior to the date of application, and (3) a one-hundred-dollar licensing fee or licensing renewal fee, made payable to the state.

Upon being satisfied of the suitability of the applicant for licensure, the commissioner may license the applicant as a security officer. Such license shall be renewed every five years. The commissioner shall send a notice of the expiration date of such license to the holder of such license, by first class mail or electronic mail, not less than ninety days before such expiration, and shall include with such notice an application for renewal. The holder of such license may elect to receive such notice by first class mail or electronic mail. The security officer license shall be valid for a period of ninety days after its expiration date unless the license has been revoked or is under suspension pursuant to section 29-161v . An application for renewal filed with the commissioner after the expiration date shall be accompanied by a late fee of twenty-five dollars. The commissioner shall not renew any license that has been expired for more than ninety days.\n\n(d) Upon the security officer's successful completion of training and licensing by the commissioner, or immediately upon hiring a licensed security officer, the security service employing such security officer shall apply to register such security officer with the commissioner on forms provided by the commissioner. Such application shall be accompanied by payment of a forty-dollar application fee payable to the state. The Division of State Police within the Department of Emergency Services and Public Protection shall keep on file the completed registration form and all related material. An identification card with the name, date of birth, address, full-face photograph, physical descriptors and signature of the applicant shall be issued to the security officer, and shall be carried by the security officer at all times while performing the duties associated with the security officer's employment.

The applicant shall not perform such duties at a public or private preschool, elementary or secondary school or at a facility licensed and used exclusively as a child care center, as described in subdivision (1) of subsection (a) of section 19a-77 . The applicant shall cease to perform such duties pursuant to this subsection when the commissioner grants or denies the pending application for a security license under this section.\n\n(i) Any person, firm or corporation that violates any provision of subsection (b), (d), (e), (g) or (h) of this section shall be fined seventy-five dollars for each offense. Each distinct violation of this section shall be a separate offense and, in the case of a continuing violation, each day thereof shall be deemed a separate offense."

No fee shall be required of the state or any agency of the state. All fees collected by the commissioner under authority of this chapter shall be transferred by the commissioner to the State Treasurer for deposit in the General Fund. If the report of inspection by the Department of Administrative Services inspector or special inspector indicates that any boiler meets the requirements of this chapter and the boiler regulations, an operating certificate shall be issued by the commissioner to the owner or user. Such certificate shall state the pressure and other conditions under which such boiler may be lawfully operated. An operating certificate shall be valid for a period of not more than twelve months from the date of internal inspection, in the case of power boilers inspected pursuant to subdivision (1) of section 29-237 , except that the certificate shall be valid for a period of not more than two months beyond the period set by the Commissioner of Administrative Services in accordance with section 29-237 . An operating certificate shall be valid for a period of not more than eighteen months from the date of internal inspection in the case of power boilers inspected pursuant to subdivision (2) of section 29-237 . Operating certificates shall be valid for twenty-four months in the case of low pressure steam or vapor heating boilers, hot water heating boilers, hot water supply boilers and hot water heaters approved by a nationally recognized testing agency. If a boiler inspected by a state boiler inspector or special inspector commissioned by said commissioner is found to conform with the requirements of this chapter and the boiler regulations, an operating certificate shall be issued by said commissioner to the owner or user upon the receipt of the insuring company's report or the state boiler inspector's report. Said commissioner may order reinspection if reasonable doubt exists regarding any inspection. Such certificate shall state the pressure and other conditions under which such boiler may be lawfully operated and shall be valid not more than the period indicated in this section and shall be renewed each year in the case of power boilers inspected pursuant to subdivision (1) of section 29-237 , every eighteen months in the case of power boilers inspected pursuant to subdivision (2) of section 29-237 , and biennially in the case of hot water heating or hot water supply boilers and hot water heaters. An operating certificate shall be immediately invalid if the boiler is relocated or altered, unless such relocation or alteration has been approved in accordance with this chapter or the boiler code and regulations. No boiler shall be operated unless a valid operating certificate is displayed under glass in a conspicuous place in the room in which such boiler is located. If the boiler is not located within the building, the certificate shall be posted in a location convenient to the boiler inspected. In the case of a portable boiler such certificate shall be kept in a metal container to be fastened to the boiler or kept in a tool box accompanying the boiler."

No such display shall be handled or fired by any person until such person has been granted a certificate of competency by the Commissioner of Emergency Services and Public Protection, in respect to which a fee of two hundred dollars shall be payable to the State Treasurer when issued and which may be renewed every three years upon payment of a fee of one hundred ninety dollars payable to the State Treasurer, provided such certificate may be suspended or revoked by said commissioner at any time for cause. Such certificate of competency shall attest to the fact that such operator is competent to fire a display. Such display shall be of such a character and so located, discharged or fired as in the opinion of the chiefs of the police and fire departments or such selectman, after proper inspection, will not be hazardous to property or endanger any person or persons. In an aerial bomb, no salute, report or maroon may be used that is composed of a formula of chlorate of potash, sulphur, black needle antimony and dark aluminum. Formulas that may be used in a salute, report or maroon are as follows: (A) Perchlorate of potash, black needle antimony and dark aluminum, and (B) perchlorate of potash, dark aluminum and sulphur. No high explosive such as dynamite, fulminate of mercury or other stimulator for detonating shall be used in any aerial bomb or other pyrotechnics. Application for permits shall be made in writing at least fifteen days prior to the date of display, on such notice as the Commissioner of Emergency Services and Public Protection by regulation prescribes, on forms furnished by the commissioner, and a fee of one hundred dollars shall be payable to the State Treasurer with each such application. After such permit has been granted, sales, possession, use and distribution of fireworks for such display shall be lawful for that purpose only. No permit granted hereunder shall be transferable. Any permit issued under the provisions of this section may be suspended or revoked by the Commissioner of Emergency Services and Public Protection or the local fire marshal for violation by the permittee of any provision of the general statutes, any regulation or any ordinance relating to fireworks.\n\n(c) The Commissioner of Emergency Services and Public Protection may grant variations or exemptions from, or approve equivalent or alternate compliance with, particular provisions of any regulation issued under the provisions of subsection (b) of this section where strict compliance with such provisions would entail practical difficulty or unnecessary hardship or is otherwise adjudged unwarranted, provided any such variation, exemption, approved equivalent or alternate compliance shall, in the opinion of the commissioner, secure the public safety and shall be made in writing.\n\n(d) Any person, firm or corporation violating the provisions of this section shall be guilty of a class C misdemeanor, except that (1) any person, firm or corporation violating the provisions of subsection (a) of this section by offering for sale, exposing for sale or selling at retail or possessing with intent to sell any fireworks with a value exceeding ten thousand dollars shall be guilty of a class A misdemeanor, and (2) any person, firm or corporation violating any provision of subsection (b) of this section or any regulation adopted thereunder shall be guilty of a class A misdemeanor, except if death or injury results from any such violation, such person, firm or corporation shall be guilty of a class C felony."

The State Fire Marshal shall update the directory as necessary in order to correct mistakes and to add or remove a holder or cigarette to keep the directory current and in conformity with the requirements of sections 29-416 to 29-421 , inclusive.\n\n(b) The State Fire Marshal shall not include or retain in such directory the cigarette of any holder if the holder: (1) Has failed to provide the required certification, (2) has failed to provide copies of reports, as required by subsection (d) of section 29-418 , and more than sixty days have elapsed since the holder received the written request therefor, or (3) has provided a certification that the State Fire Marshal determines is not in compliance with the provisions of section 29-419 , unless such violation has been remedied to the satisfaction of the State Fire Marshal.\n\n(c) Any holder aggrieved by a determination by the State Fire Marshal not to include a cigarette in the directory maintained pursuant to this section or to remove such cigarette from the directory may apply, not later than thirty days after such determination, to the superior court for the judicial district of Hartford, which court may grant appropriate relief.\n\n(d) If the State Fire Marshal determines that a holder of a cigarette manufacturer's license has violated a provision of this section or section 29-419 , the Attorney General, upon referral from the State Fire Marshal, may bring a civil action in the superior court for the judicial district of Hartford to recover a civil penalty of not more than ten thousand dollars per violation and such injunctive and equitable relief as the court deems appropriate."
