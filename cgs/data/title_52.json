Our chancery practice differs from that of England. 23 C. 555. Court may render such judgment, legal or equitable, as the case requires. 49 C. 447; 99 C. 216. Does not enlarge equity powers of Superior Court on probate appeals. 53 C. 35. Two suits must not be brought where one is as effectual. 59 C. 503. Deed may be reformed and damages awarded for breach of covenants contained in the deed as reformed. 60 C. 170. Equitable estoppel may be claimed in action at law; 66 C. 156; 77 C. 185; so equitable counterclaims. 81 C. 246. Asking both legal and equitable relief. 68 C. 204; 72 C. 554; 77 C. 214; 80 C. 685; 83 C. 109; 85 C. 159; 100 C. 718. “Court” means the tribunal itself as established to administer public justice, not the judge as opposed to the jury. 68 C. 286. Equitable defenses are available on an appeal from a justice. 69 C. 30. The practice act has disregarded the technical formalities of common-law pleading and has followed in the main the practice in equity. 72 C. 199; 81 C. 402. With the enactment of the practice act, pleading, as a system of technical form, substantially disappeared. 73 C. 5. Policy of statute. 75 C. 243.

Application to suit for damages for fraudulent conveyance and also claim for reconveyance in one complaint. 100 C. 717. Creates no new substantive rights; equitable defense must state good cause of action under established equity rules. 103 C. 299. But no longer necessary in equitable action to allege no adequate remedy at law. 105 C. 84. Where equities are strongly in favor of appellee, an error in procedure will not be ground for granting a new trial unless an inflexible rule compels it. 109 C. 299. For more than a century, jurisdiction in matters of equity was retained and exercised by the General Assembly. 3 Dal. 386; 23 C. 430. Receiver may file cross complaint against claimant; remedy at law to exclude equity jurisdiction must be as complete and beneficial as relief in equity. 117 C. 445. Where court has jurisdiction over subject matter, fact that judgment granting equitable relief prayed for might be erroneous does not deprive court of jurisdiction so as to make judgment void. 132 C. 128. Equity has full jurisdiction of suit for an accounting and settlement of partnership affairs. 147 C. 160.

However, no subpoena may compel the production of matters which are privileged or otherwise protected by law from discovery.",

If objection is made, the party at whose request the subpoena was issued shall not be entitled to inspect and copy the disputed materials except pursuant to an order of the court in which the cause is pending. The party who requested the subpoena may, if objection has been made, move upon notice to the deponent for an order at any time before or during the taking of the deposition.",

Service of the objection shall be made by United States mail, certified or registered, postage prepaid, return receipt requested, without the use of a state marshal or other officer. Such written objection shall be accompanied by an affidavit of costs setting forth the estimated or actual costs of compliance with such subpoena, including, but not limited to, the person's attorney's fees or the costs to such person of electronic discovery. If a person makes such written objection, the party who requested issuance of the subpoena (i) shall not be entitled to compel such person's appearance or receive, copy or inspect the books, papers, documents or tangible things, except pursuant to an order of the Superior Court, and (ii) may, upon notice to such person, file a motion with the Superior Court for an order to compel such person's appearance or production, copying or inspection of such materials in accordance with the terms of such subpoena. When ruling on such motion to compel, the Superior Court shall make a finding as to whether the subpoena subjects the person to undue or unreasonable burden or expense prior to entering any order to compel such person's appearance or the production, copying or inspection of such materials. If the Superior Court finds that the subpoena issued to the person subjects such person to undue or unreasonable burden or expense, any order to compel such person's appearance or production, copying or inspection of such materials shall protect the person from undue or unreasonable burden or expense resulting from compliance with such subpoena and, except in the case of a subpoena commanding the production, copying or inspection of medical records, may include, but not be limited to, the reimbursement of such person's reasonable costs of compliance, as set forth in the affidavit of costs.",

However, no subpoena may compel the production of matters which are privileged or otherwise protected by law from discovery.\n\n(c) Any person to whom a subpoena commanding production of books, papers, documents or tangible things has been directed may, within fifteen days after the service thereof or on or before the time specified in the subpoena for compliance if such time is less than fifteen days after service, serve upon the issuing authority designated in the subpoena written objection to inspection or copying of any or all of the designated materials. If objection is made, the party at whose request the subpoena was issued shall not be entitled to inspect and copy the disputed materials except pursuant to an order of the court in which the cause is pending. The party who requested the subpoena may, if objection has been made, move upon notice to the deponent for an order at any time before or during the taking of the deposition.\n\n(d) The court in which the cause is pending may, upon motion made promptly and in any event at or before the time for compliance specified in a subpoena authorized by subsection (b) of this section, (1) quash or modify the subpoena if it is unreasonable and oppressive or if it seeks the production of materials not subject to production under the provisions of subsection (b) of this section, or (2) condition denial of the motion upon the advancement by the party who requested the subpoena of the reasonable cost of producing the materials which he is seeking.\n\n(e) If any person to whom a lawful subpoena is issued under any provision of this section fails without just excuse to comply with any of its terms, the court before which the cause is pending, or any judge thereof, may issue a capias and cause him to be brought before such court or judge, as the case may be, and, if the person subpoenaed refuses to comply with said subpoena, such court or judge may commit him to jail until he signifies his willingness to comply with it.\n\n(f) (1) Deposition of witnesses living in this state may be taken in like manner to be used as evidence in a civil action or probate proceeding pending in any court of the United States or of any other state of the United States or of any foreign country, on application to the court in which such civil action or probate proceeding is pending of any party to such civil action or probate proceeding. The Superior Court shall have jurisdiction to quash or modify, or to enforce compliance with, a subpoena issued for the taking of a deposition pursuant to this subsection.\n\n(2) Any person to whom a subpoena has been directed in a civil action or probate proceeding, other than a party to such civil action or probate court proceeding, pending in any court of any other state of the United States or of any foreign country, which subpoena commands (A) the person's appearance at a deposition, or (B) the production, copying or inspection of books, papers, documents or tangible things may, within fifteen days after the service thereof or on or before the time specified in the subpoena for compliance if such time is less than fifteen days after service, serve upon the party who requested issuance of the subpoena written objection to appearing or producing, copying or permitting the inspection of such books, papers, documents or tangible things on the ground that the subpoena will cause such person undue or unreasonable burden or expense. Service of the objection shall be made by United States mail, certified or registered, postage prepaid, return receipt requested, without the use of a state marshal or other officer. Such written objection shall be accompanied by an affidavit of costs setting forth the estimated or actual costs of compliance with such subpoena, including, but not limited to, the person's attorney's fees or the costs to such person of electronic discovery. If a person makes such written objection, the party who requested issuance of the subpoena (i) shall not be entitled to compel such person's appearance or receive, copy or inspect the books, papers, documents or tangible things, except pursuant to an order of the Superior Court, and (ii) may, upon notice to such person, file a motion with the Superior Court for an order to compel such person's appearance or production, copying or inspection of such materials in accordance with the terms of such subpoena. When ruling on such motion to compel, the Superior Court shall make a finding as to whether the subpoena subjects the person to undue or unreasonable burden or expense prior to entering any order to compel such person's appearance or the production, copying or inspection of such materials. If the Superior Court finds that the subpoena issued to the person subjects such person to undue or unreasonable burden or expense, any order to compel such person's appearance or production, copying or inspection of such materials shall protect the person from undue or unreasonable burden or expense resulting from compliance with such subpoena and, except in the case of a subpoena commanding the production, copying or inspection of medical records, may include, but not be limited to, the reimbursement of such person's reasonable costs of compliance, as set forth in the affidavit of costs.\n\n(3) The provisions of subdivision (2) of this subsection shall not apply to a civil action filed to recover damages resulting from personal injury or wrongful death in which it is alleged that such injury or death resulted from the professional malpractice of a health care provider or health care institution.\n\nSee Sec. 52-161b re issuance of subpoena to crime victim by pro se litigant."

To show the existence of such good faith, the claimant or the claimant's attorney, and any apportionment complainant or the apportionment complainant's attorney, shall obtain a written and signed opinion of a similar health care provider, as defined in section 52-184c , which similar health care provider shall be selected pursuant to the provisions of said section, that there appears to be evidence of medical negligence and includes a detailed basis for the formation of such opinion. Such written opinion shall not be subject to discovery by any party except for questioning the validity of the certificate. The claimant or the claimant's attorney, and any apportionment complainant or apportionment complainant's attorney, shall retain the original written opinion and shall attach a copy of such written opinion, with the name and signature of the similar health care provider expunged, to such certificate. The similar health care provider who provides such written opinion shall not, without a showing of malice, be personally liable for any damages to the defendant health care provider by reason of having provided such written opinion. In addition to such written opinion, the court may consider other factors with regard to the existence of good faith. If the court determines, after the completion of discovery, that such certificate was not made in good faith and that no justiciable issue was presented against a health care provider that fully cooperated in providing informal discovery, the court upon motion or upon its own initiative shall impose upon the person who signed such certificate or a represented party, or both, an appropriate sanction which may include an order to pay to the other party or parties the amount of the reasonable expenses incurred because of the filing of the pleading, motion or other paper, including a reasonable attorney's fee. The court may also submit the matter to the appropriate authority for disciplinary review of the attorney if the claimant's attorney or the apportionment complainant's attorney submitted the certificate.\n\n(b) Upon petition to the clerk of any superior court or any federal district court to recover damages resulting from personal injury or wrongful death, an automatic ninety-day extension of the statute of limitations shall be granted to allow the reasonable inquiry required by subsection (a) of this section. This period shall be in addition to other tolling periods.\n\n(c) The failure to obtain and file the written opinion required by subsection (a) of this section shall be grounds for the dismissal of the action."

At the first mediation session, the judge, senior judge or judge trial referee conducting the mediation session shall determine whether the action can be resolved at such mediation session, or, if the action cannot be resolved at that mediation session, whether the parties agree to participate in further mediation.

(a) by deleting the provision allowing a plaintiff to file a new offer of judgment after rejection and to continue to file offers up until trial, and amended Subsec.

(b) by providing that interest is to be computed on and added to the “amount so recovered” rather than the “verdict”; P.A. 92-110 amended Subsec.

Statute permits plaintiff to offer only one offer of judgment as to each defendant. 249 C. 339. Since intent of statute is to promote settlement and preserve judicial resources, contractual policy limitations on damages have no effect on section and its mandatory punitive provisions cannot be avoided. 256 C. 667. Relevant figure for determining whether to award interest under statute is amount of the jury verdict, not amount of the postapportionment judgment rendered pursuant to Sec. 31-293. 264 C. 314. Under 2005 revision, the legislative grant of authority to courts under section to award offer of judgment interest after a trial reasonably cannot be construed to mean “after a settlement” even if the parties agree to treat settlement as a verdict and judgment in plaintiff's favor for purposes of section. 294 C. 719. Amendment to section in 2007 evidences legislature's understanding that an amendment was necessary to bring condemnation appeals within the ambit of section, and prior to 2007, legislature did not intend for section to be applicable to condemnation appeals. Id., 803. Substitution of plaintiff under Sec. 52-109 did not render previously filed offers of judgment invalid and unenforceable, rather, the seemingly divergent principle of this section, which is punitive in nature, and Sec. 52-109, which is highly remedial, must be reconciled and leads to conclusion that substitution of plaintiff validated the offers of judgment such that interest began to accrue as of date of substitution. 297 C. 105."

The court upheld award of judgment interest in accordance with 1999 revision of section and rejected defendant's argument that defendant's conditional acceptance of plaintiff's offer of judgment is an exception permitted under statute, since such conditional acceptance was a counteroffer and defendant's interpretation ignores the punitive aspect of section. 111 CA 287.

For the purposes of this section, such plaintiff includes a counterclaim plaintiff under section 8-132 . The plaintiff shall give notice of the offer of compromise to the defendant's attorney or, if the defendant is not represented by an attorney, to the defendant himself or herself. Within thirty days after being notified of the filing of the offer of compromise and prior to the rendering of a verdict by the jury or an award by the court, the defendant or the defendant's attorney may file with the clerk of the court a written acceptance of the offer of compromise agreeing to settle the claim underlying the action for the sum certain specified in the plaintiff's offer of compromise. Upon such filing and the receipt by the plaintiff of such sum certain, the plaintiff shall file a withdrawal of the action with the clerk and the clerk shall record the withdrawal of the action against the defendant accordingly. If the offer of compromise is not accepted within thirty days and prior to the rendering of a verdict by the jury or an award by the court, the offer of compromise shall be considered rejected and not subject to acceptance unless refiled.

If the court ascertains from the record that the plaintiff has recovered an amount equal to or greater than the sum certain specified in the plaintiff's offer of compromise, the court shall add to the amount so recovered eight per cent annual interest on said amount, except in the case of a counterclaim plaintiff under section 8-132 , the court shall add to the amount so recovered eight per cent annual interest on the difference between the amount so recovered and the sum certain specified in the counterclaim plaintiff's offer of compromise. The interest shall be computed from the date the complaint in the civil action or application under section 8-132 was filed with the court if the offer of compromise was filed not later than eighteen months from the filing of such complaint or application. If such offer was filed later than eighteen months from the date of filing of the complaint or application, the interest shall be computed from the date the offer of compromise was filed.

Section limits trial court's general authority to grant relief from a judgment, but does not limit its personal jurisdiction over the parties. 249 C. 94. Defendant did not prevail on its claim that, in the absence of a finding of contempt, court lacked jurisdiction to enter postjudgment orders after expiration of the 4-month statutory period for opening a judgment; court's continuing jurisdiction to enter orders in vindication of a prior judgment is grounded in its inherent powers and not its contempt powers and exercise of that jurisdiction in this case not barred by availability of appellate remedies. 260 C. 232. Trial court's clarification of injunctive order 7 months after original order and modification was proper because court had continuing jurisdiction due to nature of injunctive order and internal inconsistencies in prior order. 275 C. 420.

Plain language suggests that when a party files a motion to reargue, which would, if granted, alter substantive rights and duties of the parties, the 4-month limitation is measured from the court's decision on the motion to reargue, as opposed to the initial judgment; because plaintiff filed her motion to set aside summary judgment within 4 months of the trial court's denial of her motion to reargue, the motion to set aside was timely under section. 305 C. 654.

Judgment against defendant that was contrary to law shocks the judicial conscience and violates principles of equity, and court's denial of motion to open judgment, although filed more than 4 months after rendition of judgment, perpetuated the injustice. 59 CA 351. Discussion of “otherwise provided by law” provision; failure to file renewed motion to open judgment within 4-month limitation period. 69 CA 349. Because trial court did not make an express finding of mutual mistake, it lacked authority to open the judgment beyond the 4-month period. 78 CA 734.

A judgment rendered may be opened after 4-month limitation if it is shown that judgment was obtained because of mutual mistake. 109 CA 33. As a result of the trial court's original order to “remove” cement blocks being open to different interpretations, it was appropriate for plaintiff to invoke the trial court's continuing jurisdiction to interpret and to effectuate the order with respect to the cement blocks, and that court properly clarified rather than modified the original order. 111 CA 436. Court had authority to open judgment more than 4 months after its entry because plaintiff had by his actions waived right to raise claim under section. 120 CA 459. Trial court permissibly opened judgment and issued corrected memoranda of decision within 4-month time frame permitted by section, and such correction did not support claim that court failed to issue decision within 120 days under Sec. 51-183b. 125 CA 207. Section does not abrogate court's common-law authority to open a judgment beyond the 4-month limitation upon a showing that the judgment was obtained by fraud, duress or mutual mistake; common-law reasons for opening a judgment seek to preserve fairness and equity. 146 CA 214. Trial court had authority to open summary judgment under section, and such motion was not the equivalent of a motion for a new trial or a motion to reargue. 150 CA 842. Section applicable to restoration of a withdrawn case. 154 CA 605. Court had authority to open judgment of dismissal pursuant to this section, rather than Sec. 52-212, where judgment of dismissal was rendered in response to failure of plaintiff's counsel to attend dormancy status conference; section does not require a supporting affidavit. 161 CA 594. Section does not preclude court from granting plaintiff's motion to correct a technical defect in a party's name pursuant to Sec. 52-123 filed beyond four months. 180 CA 461. Four month period for filing motion to open was not tolled by filing of prior appeal and said period had run when motion to open was filed. 180 CA 818.

A fact not contradicted does not necessarily become an undisputed fact which is required to be added to the finding. Id., 349.

Id., 391. Although trial court is given much latitude in discussing the evidence in a charge, an incorrect statement of a material and important fact which is apt to mislead the jury constitutes error. Id., 459. Plaintiff filed no requests to charge; it does not appear that any exception was made to the charge as given; had he any doubt about the jury's understanding, a proper request to charge would have alerted the court to the need for instruction and would have assured an adequate record for review. 149 C. 743. Charge to jury on Uniform Narcotic Drug Act; jury should have been instructed to indicate in their verdict whether the possession was for self-administration or possession for sale; jury could have found defendant not guilty of possession for sale because of entrapment, but guilty of possession for self-administration. 150 C. 1. Since there was no evidence that any of the vehicles involved in the collision had inadequate or defective brakes, the charge should not have submitted the issue to the jury; since other omitted matter was essential to a proper and complete consideration and decision of the case, the failure to charge on it, after a request to do so, constituted error. Id., 158. Where more than one conclusion is reasonably possible, judge cannot direct a verdict. Id., 623. Judge's failure to repeat all of his charge on claims of negligence may have misled jury into overlooking plaintiff's claim of supervening negligence of defendant as proximate cause of his injuries; this omission in supplemental charge was error and judgment for defendant was reversed. 157 C. 194. Failure of court to charge jury by relating law to pleadings and evidence in case was reversible error. 158 C. 75. Cited. 196 C. 53."

Statute as amended by public act 82-406, S. 3 held constitutional. 196 C. 53. Statute codifies proper procedure with regard to out-of-court settlements of joint tortfeasors. 196 C. 341. Cited. 203 C. 607; 206 C. 16; 208 C. 82; 211 C. 67; 212 C. 509; 219 C. 314; 223 C. 786; 229 C. 716; 230 C. 795; 231 C. 500; 234 C. 660; 239 C. 144. Section provides a directive to trial court that if defendant rejects the additur, trial court must set aside verdict and order a new trial, because initial verdict was necessarily inadequate as a matter of law; there is no irreconcilable conflict between Secs. 52-228b and 52-216a mandating that one be accepted and the other abandoned. 246 C. 170. Trial court should examine the evidence to decide whether jury reasonably could have found that plaintiff had failed in his proof of the issue; that decision should be made, not on the assumption that jury made a mistake, but, rather, on the supposition that jury did exactly what it intended to do. 252 C. 174. Statute inapplicable to an action brought pursuant to defective highway statute in which municipality is the sole tortfeasor because express language of statute applies solely to actions in which there are, or could be, joint tortfeasors. 258 C. 574. Under section, a trial court may, in exercise of its discretion, reduce a jury award to account for pretrial settlement payments; however, before doing so, the court first must determine that the settlement payments, when added to the jury award, render that award excessive as a matter of law, a threshold that is met only when the total amount received so far exceeds what is fair and reasonable as to be unconscionable. 284 C. 645. Because section merely codified the pre-existing common law standards, there is no reason to conclude that the legislature intended to modify the established abuse of discretion standard of review. 331 C. 777."

NOTWITHSTANDING THAT THE LEGISLATIVE INTENT IN ENACTING THAT FEE SCHEDULE WAS TO CONFER A BENEFIT ON A CLAIMANT LIKE MYSELF, I KNOWINGLY AND VOLUNTARILY WAIVE THAT FEE SCHEDULE IN THIS CLAIM OR CIVIL ACTION.”, and (4) is signed and acknowledged by the claimant before a notary public or other person authorized to take acknowledgments.\n\n(f) If a claimant waives the percentage limitations of subsection (b) of this section pursuant to this section, in no event shall (1) the total fee under the contingency fee agreement exceed thirty-three and one-third per cent of the damages awarded and received by the claimant or of the settlement amount received by the claimant, and (2) the claimant be required to repay any costs that the attorney incurred in investigating and prosecuting the claim or civil action if there is no recovery.\n\n(g) No fee shall be payable to any attorney who seeks a fee that exceeds the percentage limitations of subsection (b) of this section unless the claimant has waived such limitations pursuant to this section and the contingency fee agreement complies with the requirements of subsection (e) of this section.\n\n(h) For the purposes of this section, “damages awarded and received” means in a civil action in which final judgment is entered, that amount of the judgment or amended judgment entered by the court that is received by the claimant; “settlement amount received” means in a claim or civil action in which no final judgment is entered, the amount received by the claimant pursuant to a settlement agreement; and “fee” shall not include disbursements or costs incurred in connection with the prosecution or settlement of the claim or civil action, other than ordinary office overhead and expense."

Each such officer or person shall also receive the fee set by the Department of Administrative Services for state employees for each mile of travel, to be computed from the place where such officer or person received the process to the place of service, and thence in the case of civil process to the place of return. If more than one process is served on one person at one time by any such officer or person, the total cost of travel for the service shall be the same as for the service of one process only, except, if an officer or person is requested by the court or required by law to effectuate in-hand personal service, or for service pursuant to subsection (h) of section 46b-15 , such officer or person shall receive the fee set by the Department of Administrative Services for state employees for each mile of travel of each round trip traveled while attempting to effectuate in-hand personal service, to be computed from the place where the process was received to the place of attempted service, and if multiple trips to effectuate service are made, back to the place where process was received and then to the place of the subsequent attempt at service, and thence in the case of civil process to the place of return provided the officer or person shall state in the return of service that in-hand personal service was requested or required, or that in-hand service was made pursuant to subsection (h) of section 46b-15 , and that multiple trips were necessary to effectuate in-hand personal service.

The officer or person requesting the receipt of such fees for attempted round trip travel may only receive such fees from the Judicial Department when ordered by the court or by law to effectuate in-hand personal service and only when such in-hand personal service is effectuated, when in-hand personal service of process is made pursuant to subsection (h) of section 46b-15 , or subsection (d) of section 46b-16a . Such payment from the Judicial Department of attempted round trip travel for in-hand service of process may be limited to three round trips, provided nothing in this section shall limit payment of a greater amount from the Judicial Department to an officer or person serving process.

Party may appeal, though not in fact aggrieved. 60 C. 427; 97 C. 519; 101 C. 735. Right depends on possibility of, rather than actual, grievance. 69 C. 715; 122 C. 464; 130 C. 499. New trial should not be sought where only small amount involved. 79 C. 104; 88 C. 50. Meaning of “action”. 79 C. 47. One who cannot share in fund in any event cannot appeal from decision as to its distribution. 82 C. 320. Legislature may make decision of trial judge final, as in matter of election as to sale of liquors. 83 C. 330; 88 C. 141. Remedy where appeal not proper is motion to erase. 96 C. 718; 108 C. 307; 109 C. 51. Judgment for one defendant and against the other final as to former, though latter appeals. 97 C. 223. Cited. 114 C. 584. Decision setting aside verdict is not a final judgment; formerly appealable under a separate statute. 115 C. 680. Formerly, appeal from decision on motion to set aside verdict could not be combined with appeal from judgment. 119 C. 312; Id., 400. Appellee to avail himself of claimed error should file cross-appeal; bill of exceptions does not take place of appeal. 122 C. 465. Cited. 126 C. 591, 604; 128 C. 478; 130 C. 282; Id., 472. Trustee may appeal in representative capacity from judgment which will result in destruction of trust. Id., 494. Now possible to take single appeal both from ruling on motion to set verdict aside and from judgment. Id., 559. Appeal from judgment of nonsuit held improper and appeal dismissed; dismissal does not conclude substantive rights of plaintiff. 145 C. 99. Cited. Id., 130. Where motion to set aside a verdict is denied, judgment is rendered upon the verdict and the appeal is from that judgment. Id., 401. Failure to appeal from such judgment is defect of form and does not void appeal. Id, 586. Failure of plaintiff to file timely motion to dismiss considered waiver of defendants' defective appeal. 146 C. 282. If no motion to dismiss appeal from denial of motion is filed within 10 days of appeal, defect may be deemed waived. 147 C. 109. Failure to make timely objection, whether through mistake of law, inattention or design, to errors occurring in the course of a trial may disqualify issue as a basis of appeal. Id., 296. Appeal bond obligated defendant to one plaintiff only, held, on timely motion of other plaintiff, that appeal was defective as to such plaintiff. Id., 722. The Liquor Control Commission represents the public interest in such matters as the issuance, renewal, revocation and suspension of liquor permits; when action of commission with respect to such a matter is reversed by a court, commission is a party aggrieved by the decision of the court and, as such, may appeal to the Supreme Court. 150 C. 68. City employer in workers' compensation case seeking to intervene in employee's negligence action against physician satisfies the test for appellate jurisdiction. 253 C. 429. Appellate jurisdiction is limited to final judgments of trial court. 263 C. 39. Where state appeals criminal defendant's motion for a new trial after guilty verdict had been rendered, court concluded that section applies to criminal cases and authorizes such an appeal upon the granting of motion to set aside the verdict but not upon the granting of motion for a new trial. 265 C. 658."

A judgment may be final as to one party alone; 66 C. 37; 97 C. 223; or as to one part of controversy alone. 69 C. 714. A judgment rendered on a directed verdict is a final judgment. 104 C. 451. Judgment entered when party refuses to plead further after demurrer is overruled, is final. 124 C. 342. After judgment rendered on one cause of action, denial of plaintiff's motion for trial on another cause of action, in same complaint, is final judgment. 126 C. 690. Judgment dismissing action for want of jurisdiction is final. 133 C. 249. To constitute a final judgment, the rights of the parties must be concluded by the ruling so that further proceedings cannot affect them; order of reference to a state referee and refusal of court to grant motion to revoke, both final judgments from which an appeal may be taken. 146 C. 55. An order staying proceedings is not a final order and therefore not appealable; denial of motion to expunge a counterclaim held not an appealable judgment. 148 C. 218. In criminal case, appeal from “the verdict rendered ... and the sentence of the court”, while not taken from final judgment in strict accordance with statute, was treated as one from final judgment since imposition of sentence is judgment of court. 149 C. 489."

Failure to take appeal within time fixed should be attacked by plea, not motion; Id., 377; 89 C. 667; 104 C. 353; 107 C. 367; so taking appeal to wrong term; 83 C. 134; form in such case; 85 C. 618; but plea is not proper way to secure erasure of assignment of error. 83 C. 466. Answer to plea cannot deny facts of record. 83 C. 316. When motion to erase case from docket proper; 74 C. 729; 104 C. 353; as for misdescription of court; 79 C. 710; or where appeal is taken from judgment not final; 82 C. 517; or want of jurisdiction is apparent; 79 C. 46; or judgment conforms to advice of court previously given. 71 C. 589. Effect of denial of motion to erase; 84 C. 268; determination does not carry costs. 82 C. 483. Motion to dismiss for delay in having record printed. 83 C. 128.

Motion to erase part of record not to be encouraged. 83 C. 243. Dismissal of case in ignorance of fact known to parties which would uphold appeal. 82 C. 208. Motion lies to strike from record special finding of facts where question arises on demurrer; 93 C. 160; so to strike out appeal in summary process action; 95 C. 69; or one attempted to be taken from judgment not final. 96 C. 719; 109 C. 50. No appeal lies from overruling of accused's challenge to array when he thereupon proceeds to trial without a jury. 105 C. 337. A motion to open and vacate a judgment during the term at which it was rendered is addressed to the court's discretion, and the action of the court will not be disturbed unless it is a clear abuse of its discretion; motion to revoke an order of reference to a state referee is the legal equivalent of a motion to open a judgment. 147 C. 13. On an appeal by defendant from the denial of a motion for judgment non obstante veredicto, plaintiff is required to set forth, in an appendix, the evidence which he claims warrants the rendition of a verdict in his favor. Id., 18. Jurisdiction of appeal court in reviewing denial of a motion to set aside a verdict as excessive. Id., 171. When a pleader wishes to admit or deny only a portion of a paragraph, he must recite that portion; request to add certain paragraphs to draft finding must be accompanied by a record of the relevant evidence. Id., 305. Motion to vacate a decree justified only where there was total absence of jurisdiction. Id., 482. The same principles are to be applied in reviewing court's action in failing to set aside a verdict and in denying a motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict. 148 C. 419. In setting aside a verdict, court ordered a new trial rather than directing a verdict, for it would not have been an abuse of discretion for the trial court to have denied a motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict and to have ordered a new trial. Id., 426."

Informality of appeal under new law disregarded; 64 C. 462; 72 C. 403; so where error is clear; 85 C. 679; and court overlooked minor error of procedure. 92 C. 7. Where facts found were written on margin of request for finding, court regarded them. 66 C. 56. Court passed on question irregularly presented where error was apparent and public interest involved; 67 C. 222; so where question was one of practice frequently arising; 67 C. 278; so where interpleader fairly presented questions, though it was perhaps not properly brought; 84 C. 364; 85 C. 573; 88 C. 157; 89 C. 332; so suit to construe deed of trust; 84 C. 497; so where finding was made in jury case and no one objected; 86 C. 281; so where case fully argued, court overlooked failure to close issue; 87 C. 614; so in assigning error, where no objection made. 81 C. 656. In murder case, court overlooked defects of record to pass on real issues. 93 C. 343. Where case is tried upon a certain theory, court will adopt that theory. 85 C. 147; 86 C. 361; Id., 551; 107 C. 571, 580. Where question was assigned and argued as question of law, court so treated it. 65 C. 118. So it confined itself to question assumed by parties to be the only one at issue. 70 C. 489. So it followed agreement of counsel that it might regard pleadings as broad enough to cover facts found. 70 C. 540. Court regarded demurrer on same theory as had parties and trial court; 91 C. 514; 96 C. 543; 107 C. 119; and adopted parties' construction of pleadings. 94 C. 213; 96 C. 401. Court regarded demurrer to answer in light of facts stated in reply; 91 C. 354; and demurrer to complaint in light of finding. 92 C. 646. Court stated first impression on defective appeal where both parties desired decision. 71 C. 462. It accepts issues as framed on pleadings. 83 C. 666. It decided matters as interpleader though no judgment to interplead appeared, where parties so treated it. 84 C. 209. Where both parties overlooked statute, court ordered reargument; 73 C. 519; 72 C. 157; and in another case found error because of its terms. 92 C. 551. Minor grounds of demurrer, curable by amendment, disregarded to pass on main issue; 65 C. 326; so minor points which might be raised. 66 C. 134. An issue prominent and likely to be again presented considered, though another point was decisive; 66 C. 315; 81 C. 655; 82 C. 5; 93 C. 377; but an issue not likely to rise again and which might cause embarrassment was disregarded in such a case. 68 C. 71. Decision should be limited to rights of those who are parties. 69 C. 10. Where demurrer to answer presents fundamental question, demurrer to complaint may be overlooked. 79 C. 470. Court refused to discuss questions of evidence not material to decision where no new trial ordered; 81 C. 622; and so an issue, where new trial ordered on another ground. 82 C. 280. Where same questions arise on finding and ruling on demurrer, only former regarded. 82 C. 298; 85 C. 50; Id., 67. Where two appeals taken and decision of one is conclusive, court may pass on other, to determine costs, etc. 85 C. 271. It will not pass on question not properly presented where to do so would prevent party raising question of constitutionality in U.S. court. 84 C. 606. Court heard case involving salary of its own members where parties waived disqualification. 78 C. 536. Where public interest is involved, court may remand case for further finding. Id., 250. On appeal from demurrer, facts later appearing may be consulted; 74 C. 689; 83 C. 554; 87 C. 341; Id., 403, see 83 C. 634; so on appeal from plea in abatement. 76 C. 414. Where cross complaint was defective in substance, court disregarded technical faults. 81 C. 164. Court will strive to uphold judgment entered on stipulation. 67 C. 70. Question decided on bill of exceptions not open for reargument on appeal. 77 C. 667. Where there is no rule established, the court adopts the one most likely to do justice. 82 C. 571. Deeds are to be upheld; rights are to be upheld, not forfeited. 83 C. 231. Effect of prior opinion as to correctness of charge where point in question not brought up. Id., 324. Court will not speculate as to motives of pleader. 80 C. 552. On appeal after hearing in damages, complaint taken as true unless found untrue. 74 C. 382. Court is cautious in drawing inference from finding outside scope of trial court's inquiry. 77 C. 291. Where answer relies on date in complaint, court treats it as true date. Id., 528. Judgment on verdict directed not readily reversed. 78 C. 99; 82 C. 396. Court will take judicial notice; 67 C. 316; 69 C. 390; 73 C. 719; 81 C. 152; Id., 229; 83 C. 134; custom of lower courts; 84 C. 458; fact appearing on its records in another case. 91 C. 101. Courts must apply statutes of foreign state correctly, though trial court did not. 81 C. 164. If neither brief mentions assignment of error, court disregards it. 83 C. 417; 92 C. 579; 94 C. 521; 95 C. 378; 97 C. 308. Where committee's report failed to include subordinate facts, court regarded them under stipulation. 95 C. 538. Where both parties took appeal and one stated his desire to withdraw his, if it would require new trial–which it would–court regarded questions it presented as academic. 93 C. 413. Where judgment rendered against two parties, when successful appeal by one does not affect judgment against other. 104 C. 111. Finding of issues generally for plaintiff but judgment given on one count only; that count will alone be considered on defendant's appeal; otherwise if defendant prejudiced by such finding. Id., 259. Judgment for defendant in bastardy action held a bar to action by complainant's father for seduction. Id., 592. Court may waive defect in pleading where trial court and both parties treated pleadings as proper. 105 C. 478. Proper procedure in appeal by state in a criminal case reviewed. 106 C. 115. In suit for declaratory judgment, court is not limited by issues joined or claims of counsel; court will itself give appropriate judgment. 107 C. 661. In absence of a finding by the court, legal conclusions upon which the judgment is based must be ascertained from the memorandum. 146 C. 1. Court cannot act on assumed rulings of the court that are not discoverable on the record. Id., 10. Court may resort to the memorandum of decision for aid in interpreting uncertainties in the finding. Id., 42. Award of damages will not be set aside if it does not offend the sense of justice and compel conclusion that jury was influenced by partiality, prejudice or mistake. Id., 344. Assignments of error not pursued in brief are treated as abandoned. Id., 360. If sole question on appeal is the sufficiency of evidence to sustain the conviction, no finding of facts is necessary since conviction can only be tested by the evidence. Id., 693, 705; 147 C. 90. If appellant fails to present all evidence necessary for proper consideration of an appeal, it becomes the duty of appellee to do so. Id., 7. Courts should not interfere with the reasonable regulations and orders of police departments when made for the purpose of maintaining discipline. Id., 113. Request to add certain paragraphs to draft finding must be accompanied by a record of the relevant evidence. Id., 305. Distinction drawn between evidence inadmissible as hearsay and evidence admissible as spontaneous utterances. Id., 337. A stipulation obviates the necessity of presenting evidence to establish the facts stipulated but it does not preclude the court from drawing proper inferences from those facts. Id., 426. Assessment of damages will not be disturbed unless the sum awarded is shown to be plainly excessive, particularly where the amount was determined by the court in a trial without a jury. Id., 540; 148 C. 557. If inapplicable statute is submitted to the jury, the materiality of the error must be determined on the whole record before the court. 147 C. 638. In reviewing a charge to the jury, the court should look at it as a whole and at its probable effect upon the jury in guiding them to a correct verdict. Id., 644; 148 C. 130. Conclusions must be tested by the subordinate facts in the findings. 147 C. 677. Directed verdicts are not favored. Id., 699, 704. Statement in finding that exhibits are made a part of the findings for use in the Supreme Court, without printing the exhibits in the record, held not to constitute a finding as a fact of the material contained in such exhibits. Id., 720. No material corrections in finding can be made on appeal if an appendix of the necessary evidence is not filed with the brief. 148 C. 21. Court refused to review alleged error in rulings on evidence because party had not followed procedure set out in Sec. 648 of Practice Book. Id., 27. In order to avail himself of the rule that grounds upon which evidence is claimed to be inadmissible must be stated, a party must state the grounds for his claim of admissibility; a finding in a jury trial is merely a narrative of the facts claimed to have been proved by each side, made for the purpose of fairly presenting any claimed errors in the charge or rulings of the court. Id., 208. Corrections in a finding can be made if the trial court has refused to find a material fact which was an admitted or undisputed fact; information afforded by deeds and map introduced in evidence held to constitute such material fact; the fact that the trial court assigned an incorrect reason for its decision would not require a reversal of the judgment if it was correct for another reason. Id., 299. When appellant assigns as error, and makes the claim in his brief, that a material fact was found without evidence, and does not print the relevant evidence, the burden of printing evidence to show that no error was committed is placed on appellee; if appellee fails to print such evidence, then the questioned finding must be stricken; where admissibility of evidence depends upon a preliminary question of fact, to be determined by the court, its decision is not to be reversed unless there is clear and manifest error. Id., 398. Where court sustained a demurrer on grounds other than those claimed by defendant, the ruling may be upheld if a proper conclusion was reached. Id., 430. Court dismissed appeal as the question presented was then academic. Id., 456. An obviously erroneous award of damages can be corrected to conform to the finding of the trial court. Id., 504. Cited. 149 C. 576. Court does not examine transcript of testimony in search of evidence which supports a requested finding trial court refused to make; brief must be supported by appendix. 151 C. 204. Power to remand case for new trial where error is found is unqualified. 179 C. 372. Cited. 185 C. 527."

Question which trial court does not find it necessary to rule upon disregarded. Id., 118. Refusal to direct verdict is not error. Id., 454. An erroneous conclusion from subordinate facts is an error of law. 96 C. 275. Where demurrer of one defendant to complaint is sustained, but case goes on and verdict is finally directed for it, appeal from verdict does not bring up ruling on demurrer. Id., 497. In passing on demurrer, court not restricted to grounds considered by trial court. Id., 542. So, where trial court inadvertently sustains demurrer to original complaint when amended complaint has been filed. 102 C. 128. When pleading to which a demurrer has been sustained is voluntarily replaced by another pleading on which issue is joined and a trial had, there is no right of appeal from decision on demurrer. 99 C. 67. Error held harmful where material evidence excluded on an erroneous ground and, on appeal, it could not be determined that the evidence was inadmissible for the purpose for which it was offered. 146 C. 42. There must be evidence to support a finding of fact; conclusions are tested by the finding and not by the evidence. Id., 90. Cross-examination to show motive, interest, bias or prejudice held to have been unduly restricted by court. 147 C. 40. For a new trial because of an erroneous ruling on evidence, the ruling must be both erroneous and harmful. Id., 76. Test for reasonableness of court's action in directing a verdict. Id., 398. If inapplicable statute is submitted to the jury, the materiality of the error must be determined on the whole record before the court. Id., 638.

Id., 321. Considerations involved in a review of a motion to set aside a verdict on the ground that it was excessive. Id., 432. Court refused to review ruling on evidence since no ground for objection was stated. Id., 566.

Standards used by court in reviewing a charge to the jury. Id., 125. Court refused to review a disputed ruling on evidence since party did not state the grounds on which he claimed the evidence to be admissible; substantial evidence defined. Id., 135. Where a demurrer is overruled and the case goes to final judgment, the ruling on the demurrer may be claimed as error, since an erroneous ruling on a demurrer is a proper subject of review. Id., 153. Standard for reviewing action of a court in denying a motion to set aside a verdict. Id., 167. Party not entitled to a review of the correctness of a charge if he did not submit a proper request to charge. Id., 266. The same principles are to be applied in reviewing court's action in failing to set aside a verdict and in denying a motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict. Id., 419. In setting aside a verdict, court ordered new trial rather than directing a verdict, for it would not have been an abuse of discretion for the trial court to have denied a motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict and to have ordered a new trial. Id., 426."

Id., 566. When evidence is excluded upon a mere general objection and the offering party at no time assigns any ground in support of the claim of admissibility, the Supreme Court lacks a basis for reviewing court's ruling re admissibility. Id., 625. Court's finding omitted a ruling on evidence which was relied on as a ground of error; held that because of the nature of the ruling, a new trial was necessary. Id., 641. Where finding contained inconsistencies and was partially based on erroneous view of the law, case remanded for new trial. 148 C. 223. The fact that a trial court assigned an incorrect reason for its decision would not require a reversal of the judgment if it was correct for another reason. Id., 299. Where the admissibility of evidence depends upon a preliminary question of fact, to be determined by the court, its decision is not to be reversed unless there is clear and manifest error. Id., 398.

(1) On application of a judgment creditor or a judgment creditor's attorney, stating that a judgment remains unsatisfied and the amount due thereon, and subject to the expiration of any stay of enforcement and expiration of any right of appeal, the clerk of the court in which the money judgment was rendered shall issue an execution pursuant to this section against the nonexempt personal property of the judgment debtor other than debts due from a banking institution or earnings. The application shall be accompanied by a fee of one hundred five dollars payable to the clerk of the court for the administrative costs of complying with the provisions of this section which fee may be recoverable by the judgment creditor as a taxable cost of the action. In the case of a consumer judgment, the application shall indicate whether, pursuant to an installment payment order under subsection (b) of section 52-356d , the court has entered a stay of execution and, if such a stay was entered, shall contain a statement of the judgment creditor or the judgment creditor's attorney as to the debtor's default on payments. In the case of a judgment arising out of services provided at a hospital, no application shall be made until the court has (A) issued an order for installment payments in accordance with section 52-356d , (B) made a finding that the debtor has defaulted on payments under the order, and (C) lifted the mandatory stay issued under section 52-356d . The court shall make a determination concerning noncompliance or default, and decide whether to modify the installment payment plan, continue the installment payment plan, or lift the stay.

The property execution shall notify any person served therewith that the judgment debtor's nonexempt personal property is subject to levy, seizure and sale by the levying officer pursuant to the execution and, if the judgment debtor is a natural person, shall be accompanied by a notice of judgment debtor rights as prescribed by section 52-361b and a notice to any third person of the manner, as prescribed by subdivision (4) of this subsection, for complying with the execution.",

On receipt of such papers, the third person shall forthwith mail a copy thereof postage prepaid to the judgment debtor at the last-known address of record with the third person and shall withhold delivery of the property or payment of the debt due to the levying officer or any other person for twenty days. On expiration of the twenty days, the third person shall forthwith deliver the property or pay the debt to the levying officer provided (i) if an exemption claim has been filed in accordance with subsection (d) of section 52-361b , the property shall continue to be withheld subject to determination of the claim, and (ii) if a debt is not yet payable, payment shall be made when the debt matures if within four months after issuance of the execution.",

              "(6) If the levying officer cannot remove any property on which he seeks to levy without the danger of injury thereto, he may levy on and take possession of the property by posting on or adjacent to the property a conspicuous notice of the levy.",
              "(7) Subject to the provisions of section 52-328 , if the property to be executed against is already subject to an attachment, garnishment or judgment lien of the judgment creditor as security for that judgment, the priority of the execution shall hold from the date of perfecting of the attachment, garnishment or other lien. A sale pursuant to the execution forecloses any interest acquired as a result of the attachment, garnishment or judgment lien.",
              "(8) If the judgment debtor has left the state prior to service of the execution or if he cannot otherwise be found with reasonable effort at his last-known address in this state, the levying officer shall proceed with the levy after (A) making demand for payment at such last-known address and on any agent or attorney of the judgment debtor of record with the clerk of the Superior Court, and (B) making a reasonable effort to ascertain and provide notice of the execution at any forwarding address.",

The sale shall be held at such time and place and in such manner as is commercially reasonable. The sale shall be subject to, and shall not affect, any secured interests, including any such liens, that are senior in right to the execution. No sale may be made to any levying officer, or to his agent or associate. The property shall be present and within view of those attending the sale unless otherwise ordered by the court.",
              "(2) Notice of the time and place of sale and of the name and address of the levying officer shall be (A) sent by first class mail, postage prepaid, to the judgment debtor and to each holder of a lien or other secured interest in the property at their last-known addresses and (B) posted in the office of the town clerk in the town where the property is to be sold. On application of the judgment debtor or any other party in interest, the court may order further notice to be given, by publication or otherwise.",
              "(3) Notice shall be given at least twenty days prior to the date of sale unless the property is perishable or threatens to decline speedily in value. If the property is perishable or threatens to decline speedily in value, the court, on application of any party or of the levying officer, may, ex parte, order shorter notice.",
              "(c) Advertisement of sale. In addition to the notice of sale required by this section, the judgment creditor or levying officer may advertise in the legal or classified advertising section of any publication and recover any reasonable costs therefor. The judgment debtor may advertise the sale at his own expense.",
              "(d) Distribution of sale proceeds. All amounts received from the sale, and all other money received, shall be distributed subject to the supervision of the court according to the following priorities: (1) To all reasonable and necessary costs of sale; (2) to other legal costs of levy including the levying officer's fees of fifteen per cent of the amount realized; (3) to payment of the judgment creditor pursuant to the judgment under which the sale was held or the money received; (4) to payment of any subordinate secured parties or lienors who make a written demand to the levying officer prior to the sale, according to their respective interests, and to any other judgment creditors presenting an execution to the levying officer, in the order of presentation; and (5) to payment to the judgment debtor.",
              "(e) Statement of officer's fees. Prior to return of a satisfied or partially satisfied execution, a levying officer shall sign and give the judgment debtor, on demand and without fee, an itemized statement of his fees. On his failure to comply with this provision, the levying officer shall forfeit to the judgment debtor three times the amount of his fees.",
              "(f) Record of satisfaction. On return of an execution, the clerk of the court shall note on the record of the judgment whether, or to what extent, the judgment was satisfied.",

            "text": "(a) Procedure. Levying officer's responsibilities. (1) On application of a judgment creditor or a judgment creditor's attorney, stating that a judgment remains unsatisfied and the amount due thereon, and subject to the expiration of any stay of enforcement and expiration of any right of appeal, the clerk of the court in which the money judgment was rendered shall issue an execution pursuant to this section against the nonexempt personal property of the judgment debtor other than debts due from a banking institution or earnings. The application shall be accompanied by a fee of one hundred five dollars payable to the clerk of the court for the administrative costs of complying with the provisions of this section which fee may be recoverable by the judgment creditor as a taxable cost of the action. In the case of a consumer judgment, the application shall indicate whether, pursuant to an installment payment order under subsection (b) of section 52-356d , the court has entered a stay of execution and, if such a stay was entered, shall contain a statement of the judgment creditor or the judgment creditor's attorney as to the debtor's default on payments. In the case of a judgment arising out of services provided at a hospital, no application shall be made until the court has (A) issued an order for installment payments in accordance with section 52-356d , (B) made a finding that the debtor has defaulted on payments under the order, and (C) lifted the mandatory stay issued under section 52-356d . The court shall make a determination concerning noncompliance or default, and decide whether to modify the installment payment plan, continue the installment payment plan, or lift the stay. The execution shall be directed to any levying officer.\n\n(2) The property execution shall require a proper levying officer to enforce the money judgment and shall state the names and last-known addresses of the judgment creditor and judgment debtor, the court in which and the date on which the money judgment was rendered, the original amount of the money judgment and the amount due thereon, and any information which the judgment creditor considers necessary or appropriate to identify the judgment debtor. The property execution shall notify any person served therewith that the judgment debtor's nonexempt personal property is subject to levy, seizure and sale by the levying officer pursuant to the execution and, if the judgment debtor is a natural person, shall be accompanied by a notice of judgment debtor rights as prescribed by section 52-361b and a notice to any third person of the manner, as prescribed by subdivision (4) of this subsection, for complying with the execution.\n\n(3) A property execution shall be returned to court within four months after issuance. The untimely return of a property execution more than four months after issuance shall not of itself invalidate any otherwise valid levy made during the four-month period.\n\n(4) The levying officer shall personally serve a copy of the execution on the judgment debtor and make demand for payment by the judgment debtor of all sums due under the money judgment. On failure of the judgment debtor to make immediate payment, the levying officer shall levy on nonexempt personal property of the judgment debtor, other than debts due from a banking institution or earnings, sufficient to satisfy the judgment, as follows:\n\n(A) If such nonexempt personal property is in the possession of the judgment debtor, the levying officer shall take such property into his possession as is accessible without breach of the peace;\n\n(B) With respect to a judgment debtor who is not a natural person, if such personal property, including any debt owed, is in the possession of a third person, the levying officer shall serve that person with a copy of the execution and that person shall forthwith deliver the property or pay the amount of the debt due or payable to the levying officer, provided, if the debt is not yet payable, payment shall be made when the debt matures if within four months after issuance of the execution;\n\n(C) With respect to a judgment debtor who is a natural person, if such personal property, including any debt owed, is in the possession of a third person, the levying officer shall serve that person with two copies of the execution, required notices and claim forms. On receipt of such papers, the third person shall forthwith mail a copy thereof postage prepaid to the judgment debtor at the last-known address of record with the third person and shall withhold delivery of the property or payment of the debt due to the levying officer or any other person for twenty days. On expiration of the twenty days, the third person shall forthwith deliver the property or pay the debt to the levying officer provided (i) if an exemption claim has been filed in accordance with subsection (d) of section 52-361b , the property shall continue to be withheld subject to determination of the claim, and (ii) if a debt is not yet payable, payment shall be made when the debt matures if within four months after issuance of the execution.\n\n(5) Levy under this section on property held by, or a debt due from, a third person shall bar an action for such property against the third person provided the third person acted in compliance with the execution.\n\n(6) If the levying officer cannot remove any property on which he seeks to levy without the danger of injury thereto, he may levy on and take possession of the property by posting on or adjacent to the property a conspicuous notice of the levy.\n\n(7) Subject to the provisions of section 52-328 , if the property to be executed against is already subject to an attachment, garnishment or judgment lien of the judgment creditor as security for that judgment, the priority of the execution shall hold from the date of perfecting of the attachment, garnishment or other lien. A sale pursuant to the execution forecloses any interest acquired as a result of the attachment, garnishment or judgment lien.\n\n(8) If the judgment debtor has left the state prior to service of the execution or if he cannot otherwise be found with reasonable effort at his last-known address in this state, the levying officer shall proceed with the levy after (A) making demand for payment at such last-known address and on any agent or attorney of the judgment debtor of record with the clerk of the Superior Court, and (B) making a reasonable effort to ascertain and provide notice of the execution at any forwarding address.\n\n(b) Sale. (1) The judgment debtor's interest in personal property levied on pursuant to an execution, other than any money so obtained, shall be sold by the levying officer, or by an indifferent person deputed to act on his behalf, or by such other levying officer as the court in which the money judgment was rendered directs, in accordance with subdivisions (2) and (3) of this subsection. The sale shall be held at such time and place and in such manner as is commercially reasonable. The sale shall be subject to, and shall not affect, any secured interests, including any such liens, that are senior in right to the execution. No sale may be made to any levying officer, or to his agent or associate. The property shall be present and within view of those attending the sale unless otherwise ordered by the court.\n\n(2) Notice of the time and place of sale and of the name and address of the levying officer shall be (A) sent by first class mail, postage prepaid, to the judgment debtor and to each holder of a lien or other secured interest in the property at their last-known addresses and (B) posted in the office of the town clerk in the town where the property is to be sold. On application of the judgment debtor or any other party in interest, the court may order further notice to be given, by publication or otherwise.\n\n(3) Notice shall be given at least twenty days prior to the date of sale unless the property is perishable or threatens to decline speedily in value. If the property is perishable or threatens to decline speedily in value, the court, on application of any party or of the levying officer, may, ex parte, order shorter notice.\n\n(c) Advertisement of sale. In addition to the notice of sale required by this section, the judgment creditor or levying officer may advertise in the legal or classified advertising section of any publication and recover any reasonable costs therefor. The judgment debtor may advertise the sale at his own expense.\n\n(d) Distribution of sale proceeds. All amounts received from the sale, and all other money received, shall be distributed subject to the supervision of the court according to the following priorities: (1) To all reasonable and necessary costs of sale; (2) to other legal costs of levy including the levying officer's fees of fifteen per cent of the amount realized; (3) to payment of the judgment creditor pursuant to the judgment under which the sale was held or the money received; (4) to payment of any subordinate secured parties or lienors who make a written demand to the levying officer prior to the sale, according to their respective interests, and to any other judgment creditors presenting an execution to the levying officer, in the order of presentation; and (5) to payment to the judgment debtor.\n\n(e) Statement of officer's fees. Prior to return of a satisfied or partially satisfied execution, a levying officer shall sign and give the judgment debtor, on demand and without fee, an itemized statement of his fees. On his failure to comply with this provision, the levying officer shall forfeit to the judgment debtor three times the amount of his fees.\n\n(f) Record of satisfaction. On return of an execution, the clerk of the court shall note on the record of the judgment whether, or to what extent, the judgment was satisfied.\n\n(g) Completion of levy. Any levy commenced prior to the expiration of the levying officer's term of office may be completed notwithstanding the expiration of that term."

The court shall order the withholding to be effective immediately or may, for cause or pursuant to an agreement by the parties, order a contingent withholding to be effective only on accrual of a delinquency in an amount greater than or equal to thirty days' obligation. Any finding that there is cause not to order withholding to be effective immediately shall be based on at least (1) a written determination that, and explanation by the court or family support magistrate of why, implementing immediate income withholding would not be in the best interests of the child, and (2) proof of timely payment of previously ordered support in cases involving the modification of such support. Before the court or family support magistrate enters an order for withholding which is effective immediately against an obligor who is before the court or a family support magistrate, it shall inform the obligor of the minimum amount of income which is exempt from withholding under state and federal law, of such obligor's right to claim any applicable state or federal exemptions with respect thereto and of such obligor's right to offer any evidence as to why a withholding order effective immediately should not enter.

              "(c) (1) If an obligor is delinquent on support payments on any prior order of support in an amount greater than or equal to thirty days' obligation, whether or not such order is subject to a contingent income withholding, such obligor shall become subject to withholding and the dependent shall cause a delinquency notice to be served on such obligor. The delinquency notice shall include a claim form and be in clear and simple language informing the obligor that (A) such obligor is delinquent under the support order in a specified amount and any additional amounts accruing until the effective date of the withholding order, (B) a withholding order has become effective against such obligor's income, (C) such obligor has fifteen days to request a hearing before the court or family support magistrate, and at such hearing such obligor may contest the claimed delinquency and the imposition of the income withholding, seek modification of the withholding order, and claim any lawful exemption with respect to such obligor's income, (D) such obligor has a right to seek modification of the support order by a proper motion filed with the court or family support magistrate, (E) eighty-five per cent of the first one hundred forty-five dollars of disposable income per week are exempt, and (F) the amount of the withholding order may not exceed the maximum percentage of disposable income which may be withheld pursuant to Section 1673 of Title 15 of the United States Code, together with a statement of such obligor's right to claim any other applicable state or federal exemptions with respect thereto. The claim form shall contain a checklist identifying the most common defenses and exemptions such that the obligor may check any which apply to the obligor and a space where the obligor may briefly explain the claim or request a modification of or raise a defense to the support order.",
              "(2) An obligor shall become subject to withholding to enforce a prior order of support upon the request of the dependent regardless of any delinquency, and whether or not such order is subject to a contingent income withholding. In such cases, the dependent shall cause a notice to be served on such obligor which notice shall comply in all respects with the delinquency notice required under subdivision (1) of this subsection except that such notice shall not be required to allege a delinquency.",
              "(d) An obligor may claim a defense based upon mistake of fact, may claim an exemption in accordance with subsection (e) of this section with respect to the withholding order, or may file by motion a modification or defense to the support order being enforced by the withholding, by delivering a signed claim form, or other written notice or motion, with the address of the obligor thereon, indicating the nature of the claim or grounds of the motion, to the clerk of the Superior Court or the assistant clerk of the Family Support Magistrate Division within fifteen days of receipt of notice. On receipt of the claim or motion, the clerk shall promptly enter the appearance of the obligor, schedule the matter for a hearing, send a file-stamped copy of the claim or motion to the person or agency of the state to whom the support order is payable and notify all parties of the hearing date set. The court or family support magistrate shall promptly hear and determine the claim or motion and notify the obligor within forty-five days from the date of the notice required under subsection (c) of this section of its determination. Unless the obligor successfully shows cause why the withholding order should not continue in effect, the court or family support magistrate shall order that the outstanding withholding order continue in effect against the nonexempt income of the obligor to the extent provided under subsection (e) of this section. The order shall be a final judgment for purposes of appeal. The effect of the withholding order shall not be stayed on appeal except by order of the court or a family support magistrate.",
              "(e) A withholding order shall issue in the amount necessary to enforce a support order against only such nonexempt income of the obligor as exceeds the greater of (1) eighty-five per cent of the first one hundred forty-five dollars per week of disposable income, or (2) the amount exempt under Section 1673 of Title 15 of the United States Code, or against any lesser amount which the court or family support magistrate deems equitable. Subject to subsection (d) of section 46b-88 , the withholding order shall secure payment of past and future amounts due under the support order and an additional amount computed in accordance with the child support guidelines established in accordance with section 46b-215a , to be applied toward liquidation of any arrearage accrued under such order, unless contested by the obligor after a notice has been served pursuant to subsection (c) of this section, in which case the court or family support magistrate may determine the amount to be applied toward the liquidation of the arrearage found to have accrued under prior order of the court or family support magistrate. In no event shall such additional amount be applied if there is an existing arrearage order from the court or family support magistrate in a IV-D support case, as defined in subdivision (13) of subsection (b) of section 46b-231 . Any investigator or other authorized employee of the Office of Child Support Services within the Department of Social Services, or any officer of Support Enforcement Services of the Superior Court, may issue a withholding order entered by the Superior Court or a family support magistrate pursuant to subsection (b) of this section, and shall issue a withholding order pursuant to this subsection when the obligor becomes subject to withholding under subsection (c) of this section. On service of the order of withholding on an existing or any future employer or other payer of income, and until the support order is fully satisfied or modified, the order of withholding is a continuing lien and levy on the obligor's income as it becomes due.",
              "(f) Commencing no later than the first pay period in the case of an employer, or the date of periodic payment in the case of a payer of income other than an employer, that occurs after fourteen days following the date of service of an order for withholding and within seven business days of the date the obligor is paid thereafter, an employer or other payer of income shall pay sums withheld pursuant to the withholding order to the state disbursement unit, as required by subsection (p) of this section. The employer or other payer of income (1) shall specify the dates on which each withholding occurred and the amount withheld for each obligor on each such date, and (2) may combine all withheld amounts into a single payment to the state disbursement unit with the portion thereof which is attributable to each individual obligor being separately designated. If an employer or other payer of income fails to withhold from income due an obligor pursuant to an order for withholding or fails to make those payments, such employer or other payer of income is liable to such person for the full amount of income not withheld since receipt of proper notice in an action therefor, and the amount secured in the action shall be applied by such person toward the arrearage owed by the obligor. Such employer or other payer of income shall be subject to a finding of contempt by the court or family support magistrate for failure to honor such order for withholding, provided service of the order is made in accordance with section 52-57 or by certified mail, return receipt requested.",
              "(g) All orders for withholding issued pursuant to this section shall take precedence over any execution issued pursuant to section 52-361 of the general statutes revised to 1983, or section 52-361a . Two or more orders for withholding may be levied concurrently under this section, but if the total levy in any week exceeds the maximum permitted under this section, all sums due shall be allocated by the state disbursement unit in proportion to the amount of such orders, giving priority in such allocation to current support.",
              "(h) Service of any process under this section, including any notice, may be made in accordance with section 52-57 , or by certified mail, return receipt requested. If service is made on behalf of the state, it may be made by an authorized employee of Support Enforcement Services, by an investigator or other officer of the Office of Child Support Services within the Department of Social Services, by an investigator of the Department of Administrative Services or by the Attorney General.

              "(k) The employer shall notify promptly the dependent or Support Enforcement Services as directed when the obligor terminates employment, makes a claim for workers' compensation benefits or makes a claim for unemployment compensation benefits and shall provide the obligor's last-known address and the name and address of the obligor's new employer, if known. When the obligor makes a claim for workers' compensation benefits, the employer shall include a copy of any order for withholding received by the employer for the obligor with the employer's first report of occupational illness or injury to the employer's workers' compensation benefits carrier, and such benefits carrier shall withhold funds pursuant to the withholding order and pay any sums withheld as required by subsection (f) of this section.",
              "(l) When an obligor who is subject to withholding under this section is identified as a newly hired employee pursuant to subsection (d) of section 31-2c , the state agency enforcing the obligor's child support order shall, within two business days after the date information regarding such employee is entered into the state directory of new hires, issue a withholding order to the employer of the employee in accordance with subsection (e) of this section.",

The court shall order the withholding to be effective immediately or may, for cause or pursuant to an agreement by the parties, order a contingent withholding to be effective only on accrual of a delinquency in an amount greater than or equal to thirty days' obligation. Any finding that there is cause not to order withholding to be effective immediately shall be based on at least (1) a written determination that, and explanation by the court or family support magistrate of why, implementing immediate income withholding would not be in the best interests of the child, and (2) proof of timely payment of previously ordered support in cases involving the modification of such support. Before the court or family support magistrate enters an order for withholding which is effective immediately against an obligor who is before the court or a family support magistrate, it shall inform the obligor of the minimum amount of income which is exempt from withholding under state and federal law, of such obligor's right to claim any applicable state or federal exemptions with respect thereto and of such obligor's right to offer any evidence as to why a withholding order effective immediately should not enter. If the court or family support magistrate enters an order for withholding to be effective immediately against a nonappearing obligor, notice shall be served subsequently upon the obligor in accordance with section 52-57 or sent by certified mail, return receipt requested, to the obligor's last-known address, informing such obligor: (A) That a support order has been entered to be enforced by an income withholding order, (B) that an income withholding order has been entered effective immediately as part of the support order, (C) of the minimum amount of income exempt from withholding under state and federal law and of such obligor's right at the hearing on the support order to claim any other applicable state or federal exemptions with respect thereto, (D) of such obligor's right to a hearing, upon motion to the court, to offer any evidence as to why the withholding order effective immediately should not continue in effect, (E) of the amount of income received by such obligor which formed the basis for the support order against such obligor, and (F) of such obligor's right to move to modify the support order if such obligor's income has changed substantially or if the support order substantially deviates from the child support guidelines established pursuant to section 46b-215a .\n\n(c) (1) If an obligor is delinquent on support payments on any prior order of support in an amount greater than or equal to thirty days' obligation, whether or not such order is subject to a contingent income withholding, such obligor shall become subject to withholding and the dependent shall cause a delinquency notice to be served on such obligor. The delinquency notice shall include a claim form and be in clear and simple language informing the obligor that (A) such obligor is delinquent under the support order in a specified amount and any additional amounts accruing until the effective date of the withholding order, (B) a withholding order has become effective against such obligor's income, (C) such obligor has fifteen days to request a hearing before the court or family support magistrate, and at such hearing such obligor may contest the claimed delinquency and the imposition of the income withholding, seek modification of the withholding order, and claim any lawful exemption with respect to such obligor's income, (D) such obligor has a right to seek modification of the support order by a proper motion filed with the court or family support magistrate, (E) eighty-five per cent of the first one hundred forty-five dollars of disposable income per week are exempt, and (F) the amount of the withholding order may not exceed the maximum percentage of disposable income which may be withheld pursuant to Section 1673 of Title 15 of the United States Code, together with a statement of such obligor's right to claim any other applicable state or federal exemptions with respect thereto.

In such cases, the dependent shall cause a notice to be served on such obligor which notice shall comply in all respects with the delinquency notice required under subdivision (1) of this subsection except that such notice shall not be required to allege a delinquency.\n\n(d) An obligor may claim a defense based upon mistake of fact, may claim an exemption in accordance with subsection (e) of this section with respect to the withholding order, or may file by motion a modification or defense to the support order being enforced by the withholding, by delivering a signed claim form, or other written notice or motion, with the address of the obligor thereon, indicating the nature of the claim or grounds of the motion, to the clerk of the Superior Court or the assistant clerk of the Family Support Magistrate Division within fifteen days of receipt of notice. On receipt of the claim or motion, the clerk shall promptly enter the appearance of the obligor, schedule the matter for a hearing, send a file-stamped copy of the claim or motion to the person or agency of the state to whom the support order is payable and notify all parties of the hearing date set. The court or family support magistrate shall promptly hear and determine the claim or motion and notify the obligor within forty-five days from the date of the notice required under subsection (c) of this section of its determination. Unless the obligor successfully shows cause why the withholding order should not continue in effect, the court or family support magistrate shall order that the outstanding withholding order continue in effect against the nonexempt income of the obligor to the extent provided under subsection (e) of this section. The order shall be a final judgment for purposes of appeal. The effect of the withholding order shall not be stayed on appeal except by order of the court or a family support magistrate.\n\n(e) A withholding order shall issue in the amount necessary to enforce a support order against only such nonexempt income of the obligor as exceeds the greater of (1) eighty-five per cent of the first one hundred forty-five dollars per week of disposable income, or (2) the amount exempt under Section 1673 of Title 15 of the United States Code, or against any lesser amount which the court or family support magistrate deems equitable. Subject to subsection (d) of section 46b-88 , the withholding order shall secure payment of past and future amounts due under the support order and an additional amount computed in accordance with the child support guidelines established in accordance with section 46b-215a , to be applied toward liquidation of any arrearage accrued under such order, unless contested by the obligor after a notice has been served pursuant to subsection (c) of this section, in which case the court or family support magistrate may determine the amount to be applied toward the liquidation of the arrearage found to have accrued under prior order of the court or family support magistrate. In no event shall such additional amount be applied if there is an existing arrearage order from the court or family support magistrate in a IV-D support case, as defined in subdivision (13) of subsection (b) of section 46b-231 . Any investigator or other authorized employee of the Office of Child Support Services within the Department of Social Services, or any officer of Support Enforcement Services of the Superior Court, may issue a withholding order entered by the Superior Court or a family support magistrate pursuant to subsection (b) of this section, and shall issue a withholding order pursuant to this subsection when the obligor becomes subject to withholding under subsection (c) of this section. On service of the order of withholding on an existing or any future employer or other payer of income, and until the support order is fully satisfied or modified, the order of withholding is a continuing lien and levy on the obligor's income as it becomes due.\n\n(f) Commencing no later than the first pay period in the case of an employer, or the date of periodic payment in the case of a payer of income other than an employer, that occurs after fourteen days following the date of service of an order for withholding and within seven business days of the date the obligor is paid thereafter, an employer or other payer of income shall pay sums withheld pursuant to the withholding order to the state disbursement unit, as required by subsection (p) of this section. The employer or other payer of income (1) shall specify the dates on which each withholding occurred and the amount withheld for each obligor on each such date, and (2) may combine all withheld amounts into a single payment to the state disbursement unit with the portion thereof which is attributable to each individual obligor being separately designated. If an employer or other payer of income fails to withhold from income due an obligor pursuant to an order for withholding or fails to make those payments, such employer or other payer of income is liable to such person for the full amount of income not withheld since receipt of proper notice in an action therefor, and the amount secured in the action shall be applied by such person toward the arrearage owed by the obligor. Such employer or other payer of income shall be subject to a finding of contempt by the court or family support magistrate for failure to honor such order for withholding, provided service of the order is made in accordance with section 52-57 or by certified mail, return receipt requested.\n\n(g) All orders for withholding issued pursuant to this section shall take precedence over any execution issued pursuant to section 52-361 of the general statutes revised to 1983, or section 52-361a . Two or more orders for withholding may be levied concurrently under this section, but if the total levy in any week exceeds the maximum permitted under this section, all sums due shall be allocated by the state disbursement unit in proportion to the amount of such orders, giving priority in such allocation to current support.\n\n(h) Service of any process under this section, including any notice, may be made in accordance with section 52-57 , or by certified mail, return receipt requested. If service is made on behalf of the state, it may be made by an authorized employee of Support Enforcement Services, by an investigator or other officer of the Office of Child Support Services within the Department of Social Services, by an investigator of the Department of Administrative Services or by the Attorney General. Service of income withholding orders by Support Enforcement Services or by an investigator or other officer of said office upon an employer under this section may be made in accordance with section 52-57 , by certified mail, return receipt requested, by first class mail or electronically, provided the employer agrees to accept service made electronically.\n\n(i) An applicant for employment or an employee subject to an order for withholding issued pursuant to this section shall have the same protection from discipline, suspension or discharge by an employer as provided in section 52-361a .\n\n(j) There shall be a fine of not more than one thousand dollars imposed on any employer who discharges from employment, refuses to employ, takes disciplinary action against or discriminates against an employee subject to an order for withholding issued pursuant to this section because of the existence of such order for withholding and the obligations or additional obligations which it imposes upon the employer.\n\n(k) The employer shall notify promptly the dependent or Support Enforcement Services as directed when the obligor terminates employment, makes a claim for workers' compensation benefits or makes a claim for unemployment compensation benefits and shall provide the obligor's last-known address and the name and address of the obligor's new employer, if known. When the obligor makes a claim for workers' compensation benefits, the employer shall include a copy of any order for withholding received by the employer for the obligor with the employer's first report of occupational illness or injury to the employer's workers' compensation benefits carrier, and such benefits carrier shall withhold funds pursuant to the withholding order and pay any sums withheld as required by subsection (f) of this section.\n\n(l) When an obligor who is subject to withholding under this section is identified as a newly hired employee pursuant to subsection (d) of section 31-2c , the state agency enforcing the obligor's child support order shall, within two business days after the date information regarding such employee is entered into the state directory of new hires, issue a withholding order to the employer of the employee in accordance with subsection (e) of this section.\n\n(m) The provisions of this section shall be in addition to and not in lieu of any other remedy available at law to enforce or punish for failure to obey a support order.\n\n(n) When a support order is issued in another state and the obligor has income subject to withholding derived in this state, such income shall be subject to withholding in accordance with the provisions of this section, upon registration of the support order in accordance with subdivision (1) of this subsection or as provided in subdivision (2) of this subsection.\n\n(1) An income withholding order issued in another state and registered in this state shall be subject to the procedures for registration, choice of law, notice to the nonregistering party, contest and confirmation of such order in sections 46b-370 to 46b-380 , inclusive.\n\n(2) An income withholding order issued in another state and received directly by an employer in this state shall be subject to the procedures in sections 46b-358 to 46b-364 , inclusive. Such employer shall, in addition to following the procedures in said sections, immediately provide to the obligor a copy of the notice and claim form provided by the Department of Social Services pursuant to subparagraph (A) of this subdivision.\n\n(A) The Department of Social Services shall make available to all employers in this state a standard notice and claim form, written in clear and simple language, which shall include (i) notice that money will be withheld from the employee's wages for child support and health insurance; (ii) notice of the amount of disposable earnings that are exempt from the income withholding order; (iii) notice that the amount of the income withholding order may not exceed the maximum permitted by federal law under 15 USC 1673, together with a statement of the obligor's right to claim any other applicable state or federal exemptions; (iv) notice of the right to object to the validity or enforcement of such income withholding order in a court in this state and of the right to seek modification of the underlying support order in the court of continuing exclusive jurisdiction; (v) notice of the right to seek the assistance of the Office of Child Support Services of the Department of Social Services and the toll-free telephone number at which the office can be contacted; and (vi) a claim form which shall include (I) a list of the most common defenses and exemptions to such income withholding order in a manner which allows the obligor to check any of the defenses and exemptions which apply; (II) a space where the obligor may briefly explain the obligor's claim or defense; (III) a space where the obligor may initiate a request for services to modify the support order, and the address of the Office of Child Support Services of the Department of Social Services to which such request may be sent; (IV) a space for the obligor to provide the obligor's address and the name of the town in which the obligor principally conducts the obligor's work for the employer; (V) a space for the obligor to sign the obligor's name; (VI) the address of Support Enforcement Services to which the claim form is to be sent in order to contest the validity or enforcement of the income withholding order; and (VII) space for the employer to state the date upon which the form was actually delivered to the obligor.\n\n(B) An obligor may contest the validity or enforcement of an income withholding order issued in another state and received directly by an employer in this state by following the procedures in section 46b-363 or by mailing to Support Enforcement Services the claim form delivered to the obligor pursuant to this subdivision. Such form shall be signed by the obligor and contain the obligor's address. A copy of the income withholding order shall be included.\n\n(C) Upon receipt of a claim form contesting the validity or enforcement of an income withholding order, Support Enforcement Services shall: (i) Give notice of the contest to (I) the support enforcement agency providing services to the obligee; (II) each employer that has directly received an income withholding order relating to the obligor; (III) the person designated to receive payments in the income withholding order; and (IV) if the obligee's address is known, the obligee; (ii) file the claim form and a copy of the income withholding order on behalf of the obligor with the Family Support Magistrate Division; and (iii) notify the person or agency that sent the income withholding order to file not less than ten days before the scheduled hearing (I) two copies, including one certified copy of the underlying support order, including any modification of such order; and (II) a sworn statement showing the amount of any arrearage together with the last court determination of an arrearage and an accounting of the arrearage since such determination.\n\n(D) Upon receipt of a claim form filed by Support Enforcement Services on behalf of the obligor in accordance with subparagraph (C) of this subdivision, the clerk shall promptly enter the appearance of the obligor, schedule a hearing, and give notice of the hearing to the obligor, Support Enforcement Services, the party initiating the income withholding order, and, if the obligee's address is known, the obligee. The family support magistrate shall promptly hear and determine the claim and enter the family support magistrate's determination within forty-five days from the date of the filing of the claim form. The family support magistrate shall utilize the procedures set forth in sections 46b-342 to 46b-344 , inclusive, to obtain additional evidence and information as needed for a prompt determination on the claim. If the person or agency that sent the income withholding order fails to file the documents described in subparagraph (C) (iii) of this subdivision or fails to comply with a reasonable request for information or documents made under section 46b-343 or 46b-344 , the family support magistrate may (i) continue the hearing for a period of not more than an additional forty-five days and direct Support Enforcement Services to provide such notice as may be appropriate; (ii) order a temporary or partial stay of income withholding for a period not to exceed forty-five days; or (iii) sustain the obligor's objection to the validity or enforcement of the income withholding order and enjoin the employer from complying with such order. In addition to any notice given by the clerk, upon entry of the decision of the family support magistrate on the claim, Support Enforcement Services shall give notice of the decision to each employer that has directly received an income withholding order related to the obligor, the party initiating the income withholding order, the obligor and, if the obligee's address is known, the obligee.\n\n(E) If the claim form requests services to modify the support order, the Office of Child Support Services shall assist the obligor to file a motion for modification with the appropriate tribunal of the state of continuing, exclusive jurisdiction in accordance with the law of that jurisdiction. The receipt of the request for modification shall constitute a request for Title IV-D services, but the office may require the making of a formal application. Such assistance shall include, but is not limited to, providing the obligor with information about how such a motion is filed, contacting the state of continuing, exclusive jurisdiction on behalf of the obligor to obtain appropriate forms, and transmitting such forms and applicable information to the appropriate tribunal in such state.\n\n(F) Venue for contested claims under this section shall be the Family Support Magistrate Division of the Superior Court in the judicial district in which the obligor resides, provided (i) if the obligor does not reside in this state, venue shall be in the judicial district of the employer who is subject to the income withholding order, and (ii) if there is an existing action concerning support of the child or children who are the subject of the income withholding order, the claim shall be filed in that action.\n\n(o) An employer who withholds the income of an obligor pursuant to a withholding order issued under subsection (e), (l) or (n) of this section that is regular on its face shall not be subject to civil liability to any individual or agency for conduct in compliance with such order.\n\n(p) All withholding orders issued under this section shall be payable to the state disbursement unit established and maintained by the Commissioner of Social Services in accordance with subsection (j) of section 17b-179 . The state disbursement unit shall ensure distribution of all money collected under this section to the dependent, the state and the support enforcement agencies of other states, as their interests may appear, within two business days. Each dependent who is not receiving child support enforcement services, as defined in subsection (b) of section 46b-231 , shall be notified upon the issuance of a withholding order pursuant to this section, that such services are offered free of charge by the State of Connecticut upon application to the Office of Child Support Services within the Department of Social Services.\n\n(q) The judges of the Superior Court may adopt any rules they deem necessary to implement the provisions of this section and sections 46b-69a , 46b-575 and 52-361a and such judges, or their designee, shall prescribe any forms required to implement such provisions.\n\nSee Sec. 46b-69a re executions and earning assignments available in actions for dissolution of marriage, annulment and legal separation."

              "(a) Whenever an order of the Superior Court or a family support magistrate for support of a minor child or children is issued and such payments have been ordered to be made to the state acting by and through the IV-D agency and the person against whom such support order was issued owes past-due support in the amount of five hundred dollars or more, the state shall have a lien on any property, real or personal, in which such person has an interest to enforce payment of such past-due support. The lien for past-due child support shall be secured by the IV-D agency pursuant to procedures contained in the general statutes applicable to the type of property to be secured. After securing the lien, the IV-D agency shall provide such person with notice of the lien and an opportunity for a hearing before a hearing officer of the Department of Social Services pursuant to section 17b-60 to contest the lien. The IV-D agency shall file a release of such lien if a hearing officer determines that the conditions for the existence of a lien are not satisfied. Any such lien on real property may, at any time during which the obligor owes the amount of past-due child support secured by such lien, be foreclosed in an action brought in a court of competent jurisdiction by the Commissioner of Social Services in a title IV-D case or by the person to whom the child support is due. A lien for past-due support arising in any other state shall be given full faith and credit by this state provided such other state has complied with its procedural rules relating to recording or serving of liens.",
              "(b) On October 1, 1991, and monthly thereafter, the Department of Social Services shall compile a list of all obligors who owe overdue support in the amount of one thousand dollars or more accruing after the entry of an initial court order establishing a child support obligation. Any overdue support in an amount of one thousand dollars or more shall be subject to the reporting provisions of this section. The state shall report to any participating consumer reporting agency, as defined in 15 USC 1681a(f), information regarding the amount of such overdue support owed by an obligor if the amount of such overdue support is one thousand dollars or more, on a computer tape in a format acceptable to the consumer reporting agency. Such information shall be reported by the department only after notice has been sent by the department to such obligor of the proposed action, and such obligor is given an opportunity for a hearing before a hearing officer of the department to contest the amount of the alleged arrearage. Any such notice sent to such obligor shall contain a telephone number and address of the Department of Social Services and shall contain the following language in bold type: “If you are no longer in arrears or have received this notice in error, please contact the department at the following address or telephone number.” On a monthly basis, the Department of Social Services shall provide to each consumer reporting agency informed of the original arrearage of an obligor updated information concerning any such obligor and the status of payments, including a list of obligors who no longer owe overdue support, in such acceptable computer format. The department shall designate one or more persons in the department to receive telephone or other requests from an obligor or a consumer reporting agency regarding verification of information supplied to a consumer reporting agency. The department shall respond to any such request within five working days of its receipt. Upon satisfactory verification that an obligor is no longer in arrears, the department shall send a statement to such obligor, and such statement shall constitute proof to a creditor that such obligor is no longer in arrears as of the date of the statement. A participating consumer reporting agency which receives such updated information from the department that an obligor no longer owes any overdue support shall record such information within thirty days of receipt of such notification unless the information was in a format which was unusable by the agency or contained an error which prevented the agency from matching the updated information to previously supplied data. Any consumer reporting agency which negligently or wilfully fails to use reasonable efforts to comply with any requirement imposed under this subsection with respect to an obligor shall be liable to such obligor in an amount equal to the sum of (1) any actual damages sustained by the obligor as a result of such failure, and (2) a reasonable attorney's fee as determined by the court.",
              "(c) When any person redeems a winning lottery ticket worth five thousand dollars or more at the central office of the Connecticut Lottery Corporation, the Connecticut Lottery Corporation shall check the name and other identifying information of such person against a list of obligors supplied by the Commissioner of Social Services. If such person is included on the list of obligors, the Connecticut Lottery Corporation shall request confirmation from the Commissioner of Social Services that such person is in fact an obligor, and upon notification by the Commissioner of Social Services that money is due from any such person as a result of a claim for support which has been assigned to the state pursuant to section 17b-77 , or is to be paid to the state acting by and through the IV-D agency, the Connecticut Lottery Corporation shall withhold from any lottery winnings payable to such person under the provisions of chapter 226 or chapter 229a the amount of such claim for support owed to an individual for any portion of support which has not been assigned to the state and then the amount of such claim for support owed to the state, provided the Connecticut Lottery Corporation shall notify such person that (1) lottery winnings have been withheld as a result of the amount due for such support, and (2) such person has the right to a hearing before a hearing officer designated by the Commissioner of Social Services if such person contests the amount of the alleged claim for support. The Connecticut Lottery Corporation shall pay any such person in accordance with any decisions of the hearing officer or the court upon appeal of the hearing officer's decision.",

Upon receipt of such notice, such agency, officer, person, institution or entity shall withhold delivery or distribution of any such property, benefits, amounts, assets or funds until receipt of further notice from the IV-D agency.",

The IV-D agency shall further notify the agency, officer, person, institution or entity to whom notice was sent pursuant to subsection (d) of this section as follows: (1) Upon expiration of the time for requesting a hearing specified in section 17b-60 , to make payment to the state from any such property, benefits, amounts, assets or funds withheld in accordance with subsection (d) of this section provided, in the case of retirement funds, such payment shall only be made in accordance with a withholding order issued under section 52-362 when the obligor is entitled to receive retirement benefits from such fund; (2) upon payment of such overdue support by such obligor, to release or distribute, as appropriate, such property, benefits, amounts, assets or funds to such obligor; or (3) upon issuance of a decision by the hearing officer or the court upon appeal of such officer's decision, to take such other action as may be ordered by such officer or such court, and such agency, officer, person, institution or entity shall forthwith comply with such notice received from the IV-D agency.",

The lien for past-due child support shall be secured by the IV-D agency pursuant to procedures contained in the general statutes applicable to the type of property to be secured. After securing the lien, the IV-D agency shall provide such person with notice of the lien and an opportunity for a hearing before a hearing officer of the Department of Social Services pursuant to section 17b-60 to contest the lien. The IV-D agency shall file a release of such lien if a hearing officer determines that the conditions for the existence of a lien are not satisfied. Any such lien on real property may, at any time during which the obligor owes the amount of past-due child support secured by such lien, be foreclosed in an action brought in a court of competent jurisdiction by the Commissioner of Social Services in a title IV-D case or by the person to whom the child support is due. A lien for past-due support arising in any other state shall be given full faith and credit by this state provided such other state has complied with its procedural rules relating to recording or serving of liens.\n\n(b) On October 1, 1991, and monthly thereafter, the Department of Social Services shall compile a list of all obligors who owe overdue support in the amount of one thousand dollars or more accruing after the entry of an initial court order establishing a child support obligation. Any overdue support in an amount of one thousand dollars or more shall be subject to the reporting provisions of this section. The state shall report to any participating consumer reporting agency, as defined in 15 USC 1681a(f), information regarding the amount of such overdue support owed by an obligor if the amount of such overdue support is one thousand dollars or more, on a computer tape in a format acceptable to the consumer reporting agency. Such information shall be reported by the department only after notice has been sent by the department to such obligor of the proposed action, and such obligor is given an opportunity for a hearing before a hearing officer of the department to contest the amount of the alleged arrearage. Any such notice sent to such obligor shall contain a telephone number and address of the Department of Social Services and shall contain the following language in bold type: “If you are no longer in arrears or have received this notice in error, please contact the department at the following address or telephone number.” On a monthly basis, the Department of Social Services shall provide to each consumer reporting agency informed of the original arrearage of an obligor updated information concerning any such obligor and the status of payments, including a list of obligors who no longer owe overdue support, in such acceptable computer format. The department shall designate one or more persons in the department to receive telephone or other requests from an obligor or a consumer reporting agency regarding verification of information supplied to a consumer reporting agency. The department shall respond to any such request within five working days of its receipt. Upon satisfactory verification that an obligor is no longer in arrears, the department shall send a statement to such obligor, and such statement shall constitute proof to a creditor that such obligor is no longer in arrears as of the date of the statement. A participating consumer reporting agency which receives such updated information from the department that an obligor no longer owes any overdue support shall record such information within thirty days of receipt of such notification unless the information was in a format which was unusable by the agency or contained an error which prevented the agency from matching the updated information to previously supplied data. Any consumer reporting agency which negligently or wilfully fails to use reasonable efforts to comply with any requirement imposed under this subsection with respect to an obligor shall be liable to such obligor in an amount equal to the sum of (1) any actual damages sustained by the obligor as a result of such failure, and (2) a reasonable attorney's fee as determined by the court.\n\n(c) When any person redeems a winning lottery ticket worth five thousand dollars or more at the central office of the Connecticut Lottery Corporation, the Connecticut Lottery Corporation shall check the name and other identifying information of such person against a list of obligors supplied by the Commissioner of Social Services. If such person is included on the list of obligors, the Connecticut Lottery Corporation shall request confirmation from the Commissioner of Social Services that such person is in fact an obligor, and upon notification by the Commissioner of Social Services that money is due from any such person as a result of a claim for support which has been assigned to the state pursuant to section 17b-77 , or is to be paid to the state acting by and through the IV-D agency, the Connecticut Lottery Corporation shall withhold from any lottery winnings payable to such person under the provisions of chapter 226 or chapter 229a the amount of such claim for support owed to an individual for any portion of support which has not been assigned to the state and then the amount of such claim for support owed to the state, provided the Connecticut Lottery Corporation shall notify such person that (1) lottery winnings have been withheld as a result of the amount due for such support, and (2) such person has the right to a hearing before a hearing officer designated by the Commissioner of Social Services if such person contests the amount of the alleged claim for support. The Connecticut Lottery Corporation shall pay any such person in accordance with any decisions of the hearing officer or the court upon appeal of the hearing officer's decision.\n\n(d) Whenever an order of the Superior Court or a family support magistrate of this state, or an order of another state that has been registered in this state, for support of a minor child or children is issued and such payments have been ordered through the IV-D agency, and the obligor against whom such support order was issued owes overdue support under such order in the amount of five hundred dollars or more, the IV-D agency, as defined in subdivision (12) of subsection (b) of section 46b-231 , or Support Enforcement Services of the Superior Court may notify (1) any state or local agency or officer with authority (A) to hold assets or property for such obligor including, but not limited to, any property unclaimed or presumed abandoned under part III of chapter 32, or (B) to distribute benefits to such obligor including, but not limited to, unemployment compensation and workers' compensation, (2) any person having or expecting to have custody or control of or authority to distribute any amounts due such obligor under any judgment or settlement, (3) any financial institution holding assets of such obligor, and (4) any public or private entity administering a public or private retirement fund in which such obligor has an interest that such obligor owes overdue support in a IV-D support case. Upon receipt of such notice, such agency, officer, person, institution or entity shall withhold delivery or distribution of any such property, benefits, amounts, assets or funds until receipt of further notice from the IV-D agency.\n\n(e) In IV-D cases in which a notice is sent pursuant to subsection (d) of this section, the IV-D agency shall notify the obligor that such property, benefits, amounts, assets or funds have been withheld as a result of overdue support in a IV-D support case in accordance with an order of the Superior Court or family support magistrate of this state, or an order of another state that has been registered in this state. The IV-D agency shall further notify the agency, officer, person, institution or entity to whom notice was sent pursuant to subsection (d) of this section as follows: (1) Upon expiration of the time for requesting a hearing specified in section 17b-60 , to make payment to the state from any such property, benefits, amounts, assets or funds withheld in accordance with subsection (d) of this section provided, in the case of retirement funds, such payment shall only be made in accordance with a withholding order issued under section 52-362 when the obligor is entitled to receive retirement benefits from such fund; (2) upon payment of such overdue support by such obligor, to release or distribute, as appropriate, such property, benefits, amounts, assets or funds to such obligor; or (3) upon issuance of a decision by the hearing officer or the court upon appeal of such officer's decision, to take such other action as may be ordered by such officer or such court, and such agency, officer, person, institution or entity shall forthwith comply with such notice received from the IV-D agency.\n\n(f) Support collected pursuant to this section shall be distributed as required by Title IV-D of the Social Security Act.\n\n(g) The Commissioner of Social Services shall adopt regulations, in accordance with chapter 54, setting forth procedures providing for adequate notice of (1) the right to a hearing before a hearing officer, and (2) procedures for a fair hearing for any person alleged by the commissioner to owe past-due or overdue child support to the state, or to an individual when the payments have been ordered payable to the state acting by and through the IV-D agency, if the commissioner has filed a lien on the property of such person or claimed an offset against money payable by the state to enforce a claim for payment of such past-due or overdue support, or intends to seize any benefits, amounts, assets or funds withheld in accordance with subsection (d) of this section or report such overdue support to a consumer credit agency."

              "(b) (1) Execution may be granted pursuant to this section against any debts due from any financial institution to a judgment debtor which is not an individual. If execution is desired against any such debt, the plaintiff requesting the execution shall make application to the clerk of the court. The application shall be accompanied by a fee of one hundred five dollars payable to the clerk of the court for the administrative costs of complying with the provisions of this section which fee may be recoverable by the judgment creditor as a taxable cost of the action.

The serving officer shall not serve more than one financial institution execution per judgment debtor at a time, including copies thereof. After service of an execution on one financial institution, the serving officer shall not serve the same execution or a copy thereof upon another financial institution until receiving confirmation from the preceding financial institution that the judgment debtor had insufficient funds at the preceding financial institution available for collection to satisfy the execution. The financial institution shall provide the serving officer a response to the service of such execution in accordance with subdivision (2) of this subsection.",
              "(2) Not later than the seventh business day after the service of an execution upon a financial institution, the financial institution shall send to the serving officer by first class mail, postage prepaid, (A) if the financial institution has removed funds from the judgment debtor's account pursuant to the execution and this section, a notice stating the amount of funds removed from the judgment debtor's account and referencing the docket number, if provided by the judgment creditor on the execution form, or (B) if the judgment debtor is not indebted to the financial institution or if the financial institution has not removed funds from the judgment debtor's account pursuant to the execution and this section, a complete set of all the documents served on the financial institution by the serving officer, including the cover page of the serving officer, with endorsements from other financial institutions, as the case may be, and the original true and attested copy of the execution served on the financial institution. The response of the financial institution pursuant to subparagraph (B) of this subdivision shall include a notation on the serving officer's cover page, or at the financial institution's option, on a separate document prepared by the financial institution, to the effect that the judgment debtor does not have an account with the financial institution or that no funds were removed from the account, provided that such separate document be affixed to, or enclosed contiguous to the financial intuition's return of a particular execution to the serving officer pursuant to this subsection.

Such financial institution shall act upon such execution according to section 42a-4-303 before its midnight deadline, as defined in section 42a-4-104 . Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to affect any other rights or obligations of the financial institution with regard to funds in the judgment debtor's account.",

The clerk shall forthwith send file-stamped copies of the written claim to the judgment creditor, the judgment debtor and the financial institution upon which such execution was served with a notice stating that the disputed funds are being held until a court order is entered regarding the disposition of the funds. The judgment creditor shall thereafter send a copy of such written claim to the serving officer.",

              "(h) If no written claim for determination of interests in property is made pursuant to subsection (e) of this section, the financial institution shall, upon demand, forthwith pay the serving officer the amount removed from the judgment debtor's account, and the serving officer shall thereupon pay such sum, less such serving officer's fees, to the judgment creditor, except to the extent otherwise ordered by a court.",
              "(i) If a written claim for determination of interests in property is made pursuant to subsection (e) of this section, the clerk of the court, after a judgment or order is entered pursuant to section 52-356c , shall forthwith send a copy of such judgment or order to the financial institution. Such judgment or order shall be deemed to be a final judgment for the purposes of appeal. No appeal shall be taken except within seven days of the rendering of the judgment or order. The judgment or order of the court may be implemented during such seven-day period, unless stayed by the court.",
              "(j) If records or testimony are subpoenaed from a financial institution in connection with a hearing conducted pursuant to section 52-356c on a written claim for determination of interests in property made pursuant to subsection (e) of this section, the reasonable costs and expenses of the financial institution in complying with the subpoena shall be recoverable by the financial institution from the party requiring such records or testimony, provided the financial institution shall be under no obligation to attempt to obtain records or documentation relating to the account executed against that are held by any other financial institution. The records of a financial institution as to the dates and amounts of deposits into an account in the financial institution shall, if certified as true and accurate by an officer of the financial institution, be admissible as evidence without the presence of the officer in any hearing conducted pursuant to section 52-356c to determine the legitimacy of a claim of an interest in property made under subsection (e) of this section.",
              "(k) If such financial institution fails or refuses to pay over to such serving officer the amount of such debt, not exceeding the amount due on such execution, such financial institution shall be liable in an action therefor to the judgment creditor named in such execution, and the amount so recovered by such judgment creditor shall be applied toward the payment of the amount due on such execution.",
              "(l) Except as provided in subsection (k) of this section, no financial institution or any officer, director or employee of such financial institution shall be liable to any person with respect to any act done or omitted in good faith or through the commission of a bona fide error that occurred despite reasonable procedures maintained by the financial institution to prevent such errors in complying with the provisions of this section.",

Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to affect any other rights or obligations of the financial institution with regard to funds in the judgment debtor's account.\n\n(d) If the deposit account is subject to a security interest of a secured party, other than the financial institution upon which such execution is served and upon which such demand is made, pursuant to a control agreement between the financial institution and such secured party under article 9 of title 42a, and if any funds are removed from the judgment debtor's account pursuant to subsection (c) of this section, the financial institution shall forthwith mail a copy of the execution when received from the serving officer, postage prepaid, to the judgment debtor and to such other secured party at the last-known address of such parties with respect to the affected accounts on the records of the financial institution. The financial institution shall hold the amount removed from the judgment debtor's account pursuant to subsection (c) of this section for twenty days from the date of the mailing to the judgment debtor and such other secured party, and during such period shall not pay the serving officer.\n\n(e) To prevent the financial institution from paying the serving officer, as provided in subsection (h) of this section, such other secured party shall give notice of its prior perfected security interest in such deposit account, by delivering to the clerk of the court that issued the execution a written claim for determination of interests in property pursuant to section 52-356c and by delivering a copy of such claim to the financial institution upon which such execution is served.\n\n(f) Upon receipt of a written claim for determination of interests in property made pursuant to subsection (e) of this section, the clerk of the court shall enter the appearance of the secured party with the address set forth in the written claim.

The records of a financial institution as to the dates and amounts of deposits into an account in the financial institution shall, if certified as true and accurate by an officer of the financial institution, be admissible as evidence without the presence of the officer in any hearing conducted pursuant to section 52-356c to determine the legitimacy of a claim of an interest in property made under subsection (e) of this section.\n\n(k) If such financial institution fails or refuses to pay over to such serving officer the amount of such debt, not exceeding the amount due on such execution, such financial institution shall be liable in an action therefor to the judgment creditor named in such execution, and the amount so recovered by such judgment creditor shall be applied toward the payment of the amount due on such execution.\n\n(l) Except as provided in subsection (k) of this section, no financial institution or any officer, director or employee of such financial institution shall be liable to any person with respect to any act done or omitted in good faith or through the commission of a bona fide error that occurred despite reasonable procedures maintained by the financial institution to prevent such errors in complying with the provisions of this section.\n\n(m) Nothing in this section shall in any way restrict the rights and remedies otherwise available to a judgment debtor or to any such secured party at law or in equity."

              "(a) Exempt debts. Execution may be granted pursuant to this section against any debts due from any financial institution to a judgment debtor who is an individual, except to the extent such debts are protected from execution by sections 52-352a , 52-352b , 52-352c of the general statutes, revision of 1958, revised to 1983, 52-354 of the general statutes, revision of 1958, revised to 1983, 52-361 of the general statutes, revision of 1958, revised to 1983 and section 52-361a , as well as by any other laws or regulations of this state or of the United States which exempt such debts from execution.",
              "(b) Issuance and service of execution. (1) If execution is desired against any such debt, the plaintiff requesting the execution shall make application to the clerk of the court. The application shall be accompanied by a fee of one hundred five dollars payable to the clerk of the court for the administrative costs of complying with the provisions of this section, which fee may be recoverable by the judgment creditor as a taxable cost of the action. In a IV-D case, the request for execution shall be accompanied by an affidavit signed by the serving officer attesting to an overdue support amount of five hundred dollars or more which accrued after the entry of an initial family support judgment. If the papers are in order, the clerk shall issue such execution containing a direction that the officer serving such execution shall, within seven days from the receipt by the serving officer of such execution, make demand (A) upon the main office of any financial institution having its main office within the county of the serving officer, (B) if such main office is not within the serving officer's county and such financial institution has one or more branch offices within such county, upon an employee of such a branch office, such employee and branch office having been designated by the financial institution in accordance with regulations adopted by the Banking Commissioner, in accordance with chapter 54, or (C) only upon demand of a financial institution which does not have any main office or branch office in this state, by certified mail, return receipt requested, for payment of any such nonexempt debt due to the judgment debtor and, after having made such demand, shall serve a true and attested copy of the execution, together with the affidavit and exemption claim form prescribed by subsection (k) of this section, with the serving officer's actions endorsed thereon, with the financial institution upon whom such demand is made. When service is made by the serving officer by certified mail pursuant to subparagraph (C) of this subdivision, the officer may collect the actual postage costs incurred, in addition to the serving officer's fee, from the amount removed from the judgment debtor's account, if any, pursuant to subsection (h) of this section. The serving officer shall not serve more than one financial institution execution per judgment debtor at a time, including copies thereof. After service of an execution on one financial institution, the serving officer shall not serve the same execution or a copy thereof upon another financial institution until receiving confirmation from the preceding financial institution that the judgment debtor had insufficient funds at the preceding financial institution available for collection to satisfy the execution, provided any such additional service is made not later than forty-five days from the receipt by the serving officer of such execution. The financial institution shall provide the serving officer a response to the service of such execution in accordance with subdivision (2) of this subsection. After service of an execution on a financial institution, the serving officer shall not subsequently serve the same execution or a copy thereof upon such financial institution if an electronic direct deposit that is readily identifiable as exempt from execution was made to the judgment debtor's account during the look-back period, as described in subsection (c) of this section. If no such deposit was made, the serving officer may subsequently serve the same execution or a copy thereof upon such institution, provided such execution has not expired or otherwise become unenforceable.",
              "(2) Not later than the seventh business day after the service of an execution upon a financial institution, the financial institution shall send to the serving officer by first class mail, postage prepaid, (A) if the financial institution has removed funds from the judgment debtor's account pursuant to the execution and this section, a notice stating the amount of funds removed from the judgment debtor's account and referencing the docket number, if provided by the judgment creditor on the execution form, or (B) if the judgment debtor is not indebted to the financial institution or if the financial institution has not removed funds from the judgment debtor's account pursuant to the execution and this section, a complete set of all the documents served on the financial institution by the serving officer, including the cover page of the serving officer, with endorsements from other financial institutions, as the case may be, the original true and attested copy of the execution served on the financial institution, and the affidavit and exemption claim form prescribed by subsection (k) of this section. The response of the financial institution pursuant to subparagraph (B) of this subdivision shall include a notation on the serving officer's cover page, or at the financial institution's option, on a separate document prepared by the financial institution, to the effect that the judgment debtor does not have an account with the financial institution or that no funds were removed from the account, provided that such separate document shall be affixed to, or enclosed contiguous to the financial institution's return of a particular execution to the serving officer pursuant to this subsection. The financial institution shall maintain reasonable procedures to prevent the resubmission of a response provided to the serving officer pursuant to subparagraph (B) of this subdivision. As used in this section, “business day” has the same meaning as provided in section 36a-330 .",
              "(c) Removal of funds from judgment debtor's account. (1) Except as provided in subdivision (2) of this subsection, if any such financial institution upon which such execution is served and upon which such demand is made is indebted to the judgment debtor, the financial institution shall remove from the judgment debtor's account the amount of such indebtedness not exceeding the amount due on such execution before its midnight deadline, as defined in section 42a-4-104 .",
              "(2) Notwithstanding the provisions of subdivision (1) of this subsection, the financial institution shall leave in the judgment debtor's account (A) the full amount of electronic direct deposits that are readily identifiable as exempt federal veterans' benefits, Social Security benefits, including, but not limited to, retirement, survivors' and disability benefits, supplemental security income benefits, exempt benefits paid by the federal Railroad Retirement Board or the federal Office of Personnel Management, unemployment compensation benefits exempt under section 52-352b , and child support payments processed and received pursuant to Title IV-D of the Social Security Act, and (B) the amount of electronic direct deposits, not to exceed one thousand dollars, that are readily identifiable as wages, provided such deposits were made to the judgment debtor's account during the look-back period of two months preceding the date that the execution was served on the financial institution, or, with regard to federal benefits, such greater period as required by federal law. If no such deposits have been made to the judgment debtor's account during the look-back period, or if such readily identifiable funds are less than one thousand dollars, the financial institution shall leave in the judgment debtor's account as exempt pursuant to subdivision (18) of section 52-352b the lesser of the account balance or one thousand dollars in the aggregate. To the extent that such funds are left in the judgment debtor's account as exempt pursuant to subdivision (18) of section 52-352b , the provisions of said subsection shall not be the basis for a claim of exemption pursuant to this subsection in response to a levy of execution.",
              "(3) Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to limit a financial institution's right or obligation to remove such funds from the judgment debtor's account if required by any other provision of law or by a court order. The judgment debtor shall have full and customary access to such funds left in the judgment debtor's account pursuant to this subsection. The financial institution may notify the judgment creditor that funds have been left in the judgment debtor's account pursuant to this subsection. Nothing in this subsection shall alter the exempt status of funds which are exempt from execution under subsection (a) of this section or under any other provision of state or federal law, or the right of a judgment debtor to claim such exemption. Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to affect any other rights or obligations of the financial institution with regard to the funds in the judgment debtor's account.",
              "(d) Notice to judgment debtor and secured party. (1) If any funds are removed from the judgment debtor's account pursuant to subsection (c) of this section, upon receipt of the execution and exemption claim form from the serving officer, the financial institution shall (A) forthwith mail copies thereof, postage prepaid, to the judgment debtor and to any secured party that is party to a control agreement between the financial institution and such secured party under article 9 of title 42a at the last-known address of the judgment debtor and of any such secured party with respect to the affected accounts on the records of the financial institution, and (B) mail notice to the judgment debtor as required by 31 CFR 212.6 and 212.7. The financial institution may note that funds have been removed from the judgment debtor's account on any records for such account, including electronic records, available to the judgment debtor, but shall not display, or otherwise provide to the judgment debtor, the name or contact information of the serving officer. The financial institution shall hold the amount removed from the judgment debtor's account pursuant to subsection (c) of this section for fifteen days from the date of the mailing to the judgment debtor and any such secured party, and during such period shall not pay the serving officer.",
              "(2) In the event the judgment debtor directs questions to the financial institution concerning the execution, the financial institution may instruct the judgment debtor to direct such questions regarding the execution to the judgment creditor or the judgment creditor's attorney at the telephone number provided on the execution. The financial institution may also direct the judgment debtor to direct such questions to the applicable clerk of the court identified on the execution form.",
              "(e) Claim of exemption and claim of prior perfected security interest. To prevent the financial institution from paying the serving officer, as provided in subsection (h) of this section, the judgment debtor shall give notice of a claim of exemption by delivering to the financial institution, by mail or other means, the exemption claim form or other written notice that an exemption is being claimed and any such secured party shall give notice of its claim of a prior perfected security interest in such deposit account by delivering to the financial institution, by mail or other means, written notice thereof. The financial institution may designate an address to which the notice of a claim of exemption, or a secured party claim notice, shall be delivered. Upon receipt of such notice, the financial institution shall, within two business days, send a copy of such notice to the clerk of the court which issued the execution, and send a copy of such notice, or a separate notice prepared by the financial institution indicating that the judgment debtor has submitted a claim of exemption, to the serving officer.",
              "(f) Hearing. (1) Upon receipt of an exemption claim form or a secured party claim notice, the clerk of the court shall enter the appearance of the judgment debtor or such secured party with the address set forth in the exemption claim form or secured party claim notice. The clerk shall forthwith send file-stamped copies of the exemption claim form or secured party claim notice to the judgment creditor and judgment debtor with a notice stating that the disputed funds are being held for forty-five days from the date the exemption claim form or secured party claim notice was received by the financial institution or until a court order is entered regarding the disposition of the funds, whichever occurs earlier, and the clerk shall promptly schedule the matter for a hearing. The claim of exemption filed by such judgment debtor shall be prima facie evidence at such hearing of the existence of the exemption.",
              "(2) Upon receipt of notice from the financial institution pursuant to subsection (c) of this section, a judgment creditor may, on an ex parte basis, present to a judge of the Superior Court an affidavit sworn under oath by a competent party demonstrating a reasonable belief that such judgment debtor's account contains funds which are not exempt from execution and the amount of such nonexempt funds. Such affidavit shall not be conclusory but is required to show the factual basis upon which the reasonable belief is based. If such judge finds that the judgment creditor has demonstrated a reasonable belief that such judgment debtor's account contains funds which are not exempt from execution, such judge shall authorize the judgment creditor to submit a written application to the clerk of the court for a hearing on the exempt status of funds left in the judgment debtor's account pursuant to subsection (c) of this section. The judgment creditor shall promptly send a copy of the application and the supporting affidavit to the judgment debtor and to any secured party shown on a secured party claim notice sent to the judgment creditor pursuant to subdivision (1) of this subsection. Upon receipt of such application, the clerk of the court shall promptly schedule the matter for a hearing and shall give written notice to the judgment creditor, the judgment debtor and any secured party shown on a secured party claim notice received by the clerk of the court. The notice to the judgment creditor pursuant to subsection (c) of this section shall be prima facie evidence at such hearing that the funds in the account are exempt funds. The burden of proof shall be upon the judgment creditor to establish the amount of funds which are not exempt.",
              "(g) Disposition if exemption or prior perfected security interest is claimed. If an exemption claim is made or a secured party claim notice is given pursuant to subsection (e) of this section, the financial institution shall continue to hold the amount removed from the judgment debtor's account for forty-five days or until a court order is received regarding disposition of the funds, whichever occurs earlier. If no such order is received within forty-five days of the date the financial institution sends a copy of the exemption claim form or notice of exemption or a secured party claim notice to the clerk of the court, the financial institution shall return the funds to the judgment debtor's account.",
              "(h) Disposition if no exemption or prior perfected security interest is claimed. If no claim of exemption or secured party claim notice is received by the financial institution within fifteen days of the mailing to the judgment debtor and any secured party of the execution and exemption claim form pursuant to subsection (d) of this section, the financial institution shall, upon demand, forthwith pay the serving officer the amount removed from the judgment debtor's account, and the serving officer shall thereupon pay such sum, less such serving officer's fees and costs owing to such serving officer under this section, to the judgment creditor, except to the extent otherwise ordered by a court.",
              "(i) Court order. The court, after a hearing conducted pursuant to subsection (f) of this section, shall enter an order determining the issues raised by the claim of exemption and claim by a secured party of a prior perfected security interest in such deposit account. The clerk of the court shall forthwith send a copy of such order to the financial institution. Such order shall be deemed to be a final judgment for the purposes of appeal. No appeal shall be taken except within seven days of the rendering of the order. The order of the court may be implemented during such seven-day period, unless stayed by the court.",
              "(j) Determination of exempt moneys. Except as otherwise provided in subsection (c) of this section, if both exempt and nonexempt moneys have been deposited into an account, for the purposes of determining which moneys are exempt under this section, the moneys most recently deposited as of the time the execution is served shall be deemed to be the moneys remaining in the account.",
              "(k) Forms. The execution, exemption claim form and clerk's notice regarding the filing of a claim of exemption shall be in such form as prescribed by the judges of the Superior Court or their designee. The exemption claim form shall be dated and include a checklist and description of the most common exemptions, instructions on the manner of claiming the exemptions and a space for the judgment debtor to certify those exemptions claimed under penalty of false statement.",
              "(l) Records of financial institution. If records or testimony are subpoenaed from a financial institution in connection with a hearing conducted pursuant to subsection (f) of this section, the reasonable costs and expenses of the financial institution in complying with the subpoena shall be recoverable by the financial institution from the party requiring such records or testimony, provided, the financial institution shall be under no obligation to attempt to obtain records or documentation relating to the account executed against which are held by any other financial institution. The records of a financial institution as to the dates and amounts of deposits into an account in the financial institution shall, if certified as true and accurate by an officer of the financial institution, be admissible as evidence without the presence of the officer in any hearing conducted pursuant to subsection (f) of this section to determine the legitimacy of a claim of exemption made under this section.",
              "(m) Fee for financial institution's costs. If there are moneys to be removed from the judgment debtor's account, prior to the removal of such moneys pursuant to subsection (c) of this section, the financial institution shall receive from the serving officer as representative of the judgment creditor a fee of eight dollars for the financial institution's costs in complying with the provisions of this section which fee (1) shall be deducted by the financial institution from the amount that is paid to the serving officer pursuant to this section, and (2) may be recoverable by the judgment creditor as a taxable cost of the action. Such fee shall not be considered a deposit account charge pursuant to section 36a-316 .",
              "(n) Liability of financial institution. If the financial institution fails or refuses to pay over to the serving officer the amount of such debt, not exceeding the amount due on such execution, such financial institution shall be liable in an action therefor to the judgment creditor named in such execution for the amount of nonexempt moneys which the financial institution failed or refused to pay over, excluding funds of up to one thousand dollars which the financial institution in good faith allowed the judgment debtor to access pursuant to subsection (c) of this section. The amount so recovered by such judgment creditor shall be applied toward the payment of the amount due on such execution. Thereupon, the rights of the financial institution shall be subrogated to the rights of the judgment creditor. If such financial institution pays exempt moneys from the account of the judgment debtor over to the serving officer contrary to the provisions of this section, such financial institution shall be liable in an action therefor to the judgment debtor for any exempt moneys so paid and such financial institution shall refund or waive any charges or fees by the financial institution, including, but not limited to, dishonored check fees, overdraft fees or minimum balance service charges and legal process fees, which were assessed as a result of such payment of exempt moneys. Thereupon, the rights of the financial institution shall be subrogated to the rights of the judgment debtor.",
              "(o) Good faith immunity. Except as provided in subsection (n) of this section, no financial institution or any officer, director or employee of such financial institution shall be liable to any person with respect to any act done or omitted in good faith or through the commission of a bona fide error that occurred despite reasonable procedures maintained by the financial institution to prevent such errors in complying with the provisions of this section.",
              "(p) Rights of judgment debtor and secured party. Nothing in this section shall in any way restrict the rights and remedies otherwise available to a judgment debtor or any such secured party at law or in equity.",
              "(q) Financial institution's rights re uncollected funds. Nothing in this section shall in any way affect any rights of the financial institution with respect to uncollected funds credited to the account of the judgment debtor, which rights shall be superior to those of the judgment creditor.",
              "(r) Deposits and public assistance or Title IV-D child support payments. For the purposes of this subsection, “exempt” has the same meaning as provided in subdivision (3) of section 52-352a . Funds deposited in an account that has been established for the express purpose of receiving electronic direct deposits of public assistance or of Title IV-D child support payments from the Department of Social Services shall be exempt."

Execution may be granted pursuant to this section against any debts due from any financial institution to a judgment debtor who is an individual, except to the extent such debts are protected from execution by sections 52-352a , 52-352b , 52-352c of the general statutes, revision of 1958, revised to 1983, 52-354 of the general statutes, revision of 1958, revised to 1983, 52-361 of the general statutes, revision of 1958, revised to 1983 and section 52-361a , as well as by any other laws or regulations of this state or of the United States which exempt such debts from execution.\n\n(b) Issuance and service of execution. (1) If execution is desired against any such debt, the plaintiff requesting the execution shall make application to the clerk of the court. The application shall be accompanied by a fee of one hundred five dollars payable to the clerk of the court for the administrative costs of complying with the provisions of this section, which fee may be recoverable by the judgment creditor as a taxable cost of the action. In a IV-D case, the request for execution shall be accompanied by an affidavit signed by the serving officer attesting to an overdue support amount of five hundred dollars or more which accrued after the entry of an initial family support judgment. If the papers are in order, the clerk shall issue such execution containing a direction that the officer serving such execution shall, within seven days from the receipt by the serving officer of such execution, make demand (A) upon the main office of any financial institution having its main office within the county of the serving officer, (B) if such main office is not within the serving officer's county and such financial institution has one or more branch offices within such county, upon an employee of such a branch office, such employee and branch office having been designated by the financial institution in accordance with regulations adopted by the Banking Commissioner, in accordance with chapter 54, or (C) only upon demand of a financial institution which does not have any main office or branch office in this state, by certified mail, return receipt requested, for payment of any such nonexempt debt due to the judgment debtor and, after having made such demand, shall serve a true and attested copy of the execution, together with the affidavit and exemption claim form prescribed by subsection (k) of this section, with the serving officer's actions endorsed thereon, with the financial institution upon whom such demand is made. When service is made by the serving officer by certified mail pursuant to subparagraph (C) of this subdivision, the officer may collect the actual postage costs incurred, in addition to the serving officer's fee, from the amount removed from the judgment debtor's account, if any, pursuant to subsection (h) of this section. The serving officer shall not serve more than one financial institution execution per judgment debtor at a time, including copies thereof. After service of an execution on one financial institution, the serving officer shall not serve the same execution or a copy thereof upon another financial institution until receiving confirmation from the preceding financial institution that the judgment debtor had insufficient funds at the preceding financial institution available for collection to satisfy the execution, provided any such additional service is made not later than forty-five days from the receipt by the serving officer of such execution. The financial institution shall provide the serving officer a response to the service of such execution in accordance with subdivision (2) of this subsection. After service of an execution on a financial institution, the serving officer shall not subsequently serve the same execution or a copy thereof upon such financial institution if an electronic direct deposit that is readily identifiable as exempt from execution was made to the judgment debtor's account during the look-back period, as described in subsection (c) of this section. If no such deposit was made, the serving officer may subsequently serve the same execution or a copy thereof upon such institution, provided such execution has not expired or otherwise become unenforceable.\n\n(2) Not later than the seventh business day after the service of an execution upon a financial institution, the financial institution shall send to the serving officer by first class mail, postage prepaid, (A) if the financial institution has removed funds from the judgment debtor's account pursuant to the execution and this section, a notice stating the amount of funds removed from the judgment debtor's account and referencing the docket number, if provided by the judgment creditor on the execution form, or (B) if the judgment debtor is not indebted to the financial institution or if the financial institution has not removed funds from the judgment debtor's account pursuant to the execution and this section, a complete set of all the documents served on the financial institution by the serving officer, including the cover page of the serving officer, with endorsements from other financial institutions, as the case may be, the original true and attested copy of the execution served on the financial institution, and the affidavit and exemption claim form prescribed by subsection (k) of this section. The response of the financial institution pursuant to subparagraph (B) of this subdivision shall include a notation on the serving officer's cover page, or at the financial institution's option, on a separate document prepared by the financial institution, to the effect that the judgment debtor does not have an account with the financial institution or that no funds were removed from the account, provided that such separate document shall be affixed to, or enclosed contiguous to the financial institution's return of a particular execution to the serving officer pursuant to this subsection. The financial institution shall maintain reasonable procedures to prevent the resubmission of a response provided to the serving officer pursuant to subparagraph (B) of this subdivision. As used in this section, “business day” has the same meaning as provided in section 36a-330 .\n\n(c) Removal of funds from judgment debtor's account. (1) Except as provided in subdivision (2) of this subsection, if any such financial institution upon which such execution is served and upon which such demand is made is indebted to the judgment debtor, the financial institution shall remove from the judgment debtor's account the amount of such indebtedness not exceeding the amount due on such execution before its midnight deadline, as defined in section 42a-4-104 .\n\n(2) Notwithstanding the provisions of subdivision (1) of this subsection, the financial institution shall leave in the judgment debtor's account (A) the full amount of electronic direct deposits that are readily identifiable as exempt federal veterans' benefits, Social Security benefits, including, but not limited to, retirement, survivors' and disability benefits, supplemental security income benefits, exempt benefits paid by the federal Railroad Retirement Board or the federal Office of Personnel Management, unemployment compensation benefits exempt under section 52-352b , and child support payments processed and received pursuant to Title IV-D of the Social Security Act, and (B) the amount of electronic direct deposits, not to exceed one thousand dollars, that are readily identifiable as wages, provided such deposits were made to the judgment debtor's account during the look-back period of two months preceding the date that the execution was served on the financial institution, or, with regard to federal benefits, such greater period as required by federal law. If no such deposits have been made to the judgment debtor's account during the look-back period, or if such readily identifiable funds are less than one thousand dollars, the financial institution shall leave in the judgment debtor's account as exempt pursuant to subdivision (18) of section 52-352b the lesser of the account balance or one thousand dollars in the aggregate. To the extent that such funds are left in the judgment debtor's account as exempt pursuant to subdivision (18) of section 52-352b , the provisions of said subsection shall not be the basis for a claim of exemption pursuant to this subsection in response to a levy of execution.\n\n(3) Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to limit a financial institution's right or obligation to remove such funds from the judgment debtor's account if required by any other provision of law or by a court order. The judgment debtor shall have full and customary access to such funds left in the judgment debtor's account pursuant to this subsection. The financial institution may notify the judgment creditor that funds have been left in the judgment debtor's account pursuant to this subsection. Nothing in this subsection shall alter the exempt status of funds which are exempt from execution under subsection (a) of this section or under any other provision of state or federal law, or the right of a judgment debtor to claim such exemption. Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to affect any other rights or obligations of the financial institution with regard to the funds in the judgment debtor's account.\n\n(d) Notice to judgment debtor and secured party. (1) If any funds are removed from the judgment debtor's account pursuant to subsection (c) of this section, upon receipt of the execution and exemption claim form from the serving officer, the financial institution shall (A) forthwith mail copies thereof, postage prepaid, to the judgment debtor and to any secured party that is party to a control agreement between the financial institution and such secured party under article 9 of title 42a at the last-known address of the judgment debtor and of any such secured party with respect to the affected accounts on the records of the financial institution, and (B) mail notice to the judgment debtor as required by 31 CFR 212.6 and 212.7. The financial institution may note that funds have been removed from the judgment debtor's account on any records for such account, including electronic records, available to the judgment debtor, but shall not display, or otherwise provide to the judgment debtor, the name or contact information of the serving officer. The financial institution shall hold the amount removed from the judgment debtor's account pursuant to subsection (c) of this section for fifteen days from the date of the mailing to the judgment debtor and any such secured party, and during such period shall not pay the serving officer.\n\n(2) In the event the judgment debtor directs questions to the financial institution concerning the execution, the financial institution may instruct the judgment debtor to direct such questions regarding the execution to the judgment creditor or the judgment creditor's attorney at the telephone number provided on the execution. The financial institution may also direct the judgment debtor to direct such questions to the applicable clerk of the court identified on the execution form.\n\n(e) Claim of exemption and claim of prior perfected security interest. To prevent the financial institution from paying the serving officer, as provided in subsection (h) of this section, the judgment debtor shall give notice of a claim of exemption by delivering to the financial institution, by mail or other means, the exemption claim form or other written notice that an exemption is being claimed and any such secured party shall give notice of its claim of a prior perfected security interest in such deposit account by delivering to the financial institution, by mail or other means, written notice thereof. The financial institution may designate an address to which the notice of a claim of exemption, or a secured party claim notice, shall be delivered. Upon receipt of such notice, the financial institution shall, within two business days, send a copy of such notice to the clerk of the court which issued the execution, and send a copy of such notice, or a separate notice prepared by the financial institution indicating that the judgment debtor has submitted a claim of exemption, to the serving officer.\n\n(f) Hearing. (1) Upon receipt of an exemption claim form or a secured party claim notice, the clerk of the court shall enter the appearance of the judgment debtor or such secured party with the address set forth in the exemption claim form or secured party claim notice. The clerk shall forthwith send file-stamped copies of the exemption claim form or secured party claim notice to the judgment creditor and judgment debtor with a notice stating that the disputed funds are being held for forty-five days from the date the exemption claim form or secured party claim notice was received by the financial institution or until a court order is entered regarding the disposition of the funds, whichever occurs earlier, and the clerk shall promptly schedule the matter for a hearing. The claim of exemption filed by such judgment debtor shall be prima facie evidence at such hearing of the existence of the exemption.\n\n(2) Upon receipt of notice from the financial institution pursuant to subsection (c) of this section, a judgment creditor may, on an ex parte basis, present to a judge of the Superior Court an affidavit sworn under oath by a competent party demonstrating a reasonable belief that such judgment debtor's account contains funds which are not exempt from execution and the amount of such nonexempt funds. Such affidavit shall not be conclusory but is required to show the factual basis upon which the reasonable belief is based. If such judge finds that the judgment creditor has demonstrated a reasonable belief that such judgment debtor's account contains funds which are not exempt from execution, such judge shall authorize the judgment creditor to submit a written application to the clerk of the court for a hearing on the exempt status of funds left in the judgment debtor's account pursuant to subsection (c) of this section. The judgment creditor shall promptly send a copy of the application and the supporting affidavit to the judgment debtor and to any secured party shown on a secured party claim notice sent to the judgment creditor pursuant to subdivision (1) of this subsection. Upon receipt of such application, the clerk of the court shall promptly schedule the matter for a hearing and shall give written notice to the judgment creditor, the judgment debtor and any secured party shown on a secured party claim notice received by the clerk of the court. The notice to the judgment creditor pursuant to subsection (c) of this section shall be prima facie evidence at such hearing that the funds in the account are exempt funds. The burden of proof shall be upon the judgment creditor to establish the amount of funds which are not exempt.\n\n(g) Disposition if exemption or prior perfected security interest is claimed. If an exemption claim is made or a secured party claim notice is given pursuant to subsection (e) of this section, the financial institution shall continue to hold the amount removed from the judgment debtor's account for forty-five days or until a court order is received regarding disposition of the funds, whichever occurs earlier. If no such order is received within forty-five days of the date the financial institution sends a copy of the exemption claim form or notice of exemption or a secured party claim notice to the clerk of the court, the financial institution shall return the funds to the judgment debtor's account.\n\n(h) Disposition if no exemption or prior perfected security interest is claimed. If no claim of exemption or secured party claim notice is received by the financial institution within fifteen days of the mailing to the judgment debtor and any secured party of the execution and exemption claim form pursuant to subsection (d) of this section, the financial institution shall, upon demand, forthwith pay the serving officer the amount removed from the judgment debtor's account, and the serving officer shall thereupon pay such sum, less such serving officer's fees and costs owing to such serving officer under this section, to the judgment creditor, except to the extent otherwise ordered by a court.\n\n(i) Court order. The court, after a hearing conducted pursuant to subsection (f) of this section, shall enter an order determining the issues raised by the claim of exemption and claim by a secured party of a prior perfected security interest in such deposit account. The clerk of the court shall forthwith send a copy of such order to the financial institution. Such order shall be deemed to be a final judgment for the purposes of appeal. No appeal shall be taken except within seven days of the rendering of the order. The order of the court may be implemented during such seven-day period, unless stayed by the court.\n\n(j) Determination of exempt moneys. Except as otherwise provided in subsection (c) of this section, if both exempt and nonexempt moneys have been deposited into an account, for the purposes of determining which moneys are exempt under this section, the moneys most recently deposited as of the time the execution is served shall be deemed to be the moneys remaining in the account.\n\n(k) Forms. The execution, exemption claim form and clerk's notice regarding the filing of a claim of exemption shall be in such form as prescribed by the judges of the Superior Court or their designee. The exemption claim form shall be dated and include a checklist and description of the most common exemptions, instructions on the manner of claiming the exemptions and a space for the judgment debtor to certify those exemptions claimed under penalty of false statement.\n\n(l) Records of financial institution. If records or testimony are subpoenaed from a financial institution in connection with a hearing conducted pursuant to subsection (f) of this section, the reasonable costs and expenses of the financial institution in complying with the subpoena shall be recoverable by the financial institution from the party requiring such records or testimony, provided, the financial institution shall be under no obligation to attempt to obtain records or documentation relating to the account executed against which are held by any other financial institution. The records of a financial institution as to the dates and amounts of deposits into an account in the financial institution shall, if certified as true and accurate by an officer of the financial institution, be admissible as evidence without the presence of the officer in any hearing conducted pursuant to subsection (f) of this section to determine the legitimacy of a claim of exemption made under this section.\n\n(m) Fee for financial institution's costs. If there are moneys to be removed from the judgment debtor's account, prior to the removal of such moneys pursuant to subsection (c) of this section, the financial institution shall receive from the serving officer as representative of the judgment creditor a fee of eight dollars for the financial institution's costs in complying with the provisions of this section which fee (1) shall be deducted by the financial institution from the amount that is paid to the serving officer pursuant to this section, and (2) may be recoverable by the judgment creditor as a taxable cost of the action. Such fee shall not be considered a deposit account charge pursuant to section 36a-316 .\n\n(n) Liability of financial institution. If the financial institution fails or refuses to pay over to the serving officer the amount of such debt, not exceeding the amount due on such execution, such financial institution shall be liable in an action therefor to the judgment creditor named in such execution for the amount of nonexempt moneys which the financial institution failed or refused to pay over, excluding funds of up to one thousand dollars which the financial institution in good faith allowed the judgment debtor to access pursuant to subsection (c) of this section. The amount so recovered by such judgment creditor shall be applied toward the payment of the amount due on such execution. Thereupon, the rights of the financial institution shall be subrogated to the rights of the judgment creditor. If such financial institution pays exempt moneys from the account of the judgment debtor over to the serving officer contrary to the provisions of this section, such financial institution shall be liable in an action therefor to the judgment debtor for any exempt moneys so paid and such financial institution shall refund or waive any charges or fees by the financial institution, including, but not limited to, dishonored check fees, overdraft fees or minimum balance service charges and legal process fees, which were assessed as a result of such payment of exempt moneys. Thereupon, the rights of the financial institution shall be subrogated to the rights of the judgment debtor.\n\n(o) Good faith immunity. Except as provided in subsection (n) of this section, no financial institution or any officer, director or employee of such financial institution shall be liable to any person with respect to any act done or omitted in good faith or through the commission of a bona fide error that occurred despite reasonable procedures maintained by the financial institution to prevent such errors in complying with the provisions of this section.\n\n(p) Rights of judgment debtor and secured party. Nothing in this section shall in any way restrict the rights and remedies otherwise available to a judgment debtor or any such secured party at law or in equity.\n\n(q) Financial institution's rights re uncollected funds. Nothing in this section shall in any way affect any rights of the financial institution with respect to uncollected funds credited to the account of the judgment debtor, which rights shall be superior to those of the judgment creditor.\n\n(r) Deposits and public assistance or Title IV-D child support payments. For the purposes of this subsection, “exempt” has the same meaning as provided in subdivision (3) of section 52-352a . Funds deposited in an account that has been established for the express purpose of receiving electronic direct deposits of public assistance or of Title IV-D child support payments from the Department of Social Services shall be exempt."

Award that is legally incorrect does not fall within exception provided in Subdiv. (4) and should not be set aside. 84 CA 826. Subdiv. (4): Court did not abuse its discretion in finding that arbitration award conformed to the submission and declining to examine arbitrator's reasoning in arriving at the award because, when submission is unrestricted, court is confined to examination of the submission and award to determine whether the award conformed to the submission. 86 CA 686. Subdiv. (4): Trial court properly denied plaintiff union's application to vacate arbitration award, plaintiff having failed to establish its claim that arbitrator manifestly disregarded the law in concluding that article two of collective bargaining agreement pertaining to management rights, rather than article nine pertaining to layoffs, applied to facts of case; given arbitrator's finding that grievant was unable to perform duties of a security guard, it was not unreasonable for arbitrator to conclude that article nine did not address layoffs of individuals for being unable to perform duties of their position. 99 CA 54. Arbitration panel did not exceed and imperfectly execute its powers because its award did not conform to the parties' submission; trial court did not improperly refuse to vacate award. 102 CA 61. An arbitrator, in rendering arbitration award, may take into account grievant's acceptance of accelerated rehabilitation; there is no clear legal principle preventing arbitrator from drawing adverse inferences from fact that grievant has utilized accelerated rehabilitation and drawing of such inferences is not violation of public policy. 107 CA 321; judgment reversed, see 298 C. 824. Plaintiff did not meet burden of demonstrating arbitration award failed to conform to submission; ex parte communication between one of the arbitrators and one of the parties did not result in any harm and did not mandate vacatur of the arbitration award. 121 CA 31. Arbitrator did not exceed his authority under Subdiv. (4) because the submission asked arbitrator to determine whether employee had been terminated for just cause in accordance with the collective bargaining agreement and, if not, what the remedy should be, the plaintiff conceded that the award conformed to the submission and the record demonstrated that the arbitrator applied and interpreted the agreement. 122 CA 617. Subdiv. (4): Submission to arbitration panel was unrestricted, and panel was not limited in the remedy it could fashion once it determined that employee was terminated from employment without just cause, and panel's failure to reinstate employee cannot be construed as a failure to conform with the submission. 125 CA 225. Subdiv. (4): At most, the panel misapplied or misconstrued statutory requirements, neither of which is sufficient to support a manifest disregard of the law claim. 130 CA 556. Subdiv. (4): Under Subdiv., a court will compare the award to the submission to determine whether the arbitrators have exceeded their powers. 132 CA 326. Subdiv. (4): Arbitrator's decision to base an award on certain legal theories amounts to only an “arguable difference” regarding the meaning or applicability of the law, not the “manifest disregard” of the law necessary for the court to overturn the arbitrator's decision. 146 CA 60. Subdiv. (1): Opposing counsel's failure to disclose certain facts during an ex parte hearing in violation of the Rules of Professional Conduct does not amount to “corruption, fraud or undue means” as contemplated by Subdiv. Id., 768. Burden of proving evident partiality rests with party making claim and requires more than a showing of an appearance of bias, and will be found where a reasonable person would have to conclude that an arbitrator was partial to one party to the arbitration; failure of panel to consider evidence of past disciplinary actions against defendant does not provide adequate basis to vacate decision where plaintiff did not demonstrate that the panel engaged in misconduct. 155 CA 246. Subdiv. (4): Arbitrator did not run afoul of Subdiv. as defendant failed to prove that Garrity test, 223 C. 1, was satisfied because there was no obvious error and record did not show that the arbitrator deliberately ignored the law. Id., 264. Subdiv. (4): Arbitration agreement did not reference the construction industry rules of the American Arbitration Association or any other set of rules, thus arbitrator did not exceed her authority when she did not apply those rules when arbitrating the dispute. 194 CA 519."

The judge trial referee shall hear any such case so referred and report the facts to the court by which the case was referred.\n\n(3) Each judge of the Juvenile Court who ceases or has ceased to hold office because of retirement other than under the provisions of section 51-49 and who is an elector and a resident of this state shall be a state referee for the remainder of such judge's term of office as a judge and shall be eligible for appointment as a state referee during the remainder of such judge's life in the manner prescribed by law for the appointment of a judge of the court of which such judge is a member, to whom a judge before whom any juvenile matter is pending may, with the written consent of the child concerned, either of such child's parents, or such child's guardian or attorney, refer any juvenile matter pending, provided such referee has been appointed a judge trial referee specifically designated to hear juvenile cases pursuant to subsection (b) of this section.

Although custody requirement has been construed liberally, petitioner cannot bring habeas claim on the basis of an expired conviction despite remaining in custody for a different conviction pursuant to a concurrent sentence, and merger concept of Sec. 53a-38(b) does not alter fact that concurrent sentences remain separate terms of imprisonment that the legislature has permitted to be served at one time. 139 CA 173. Padilla v. Kentucky , 559 U.S. 356, which held that before an alien criminal defendant pleads guilty to a criminal offense for which he is subject to deportation, his defense attorney must advise him of the deportation consequences of his plea and resulting conviction, did not eliminate the custodial requirement for habeas corpus jurisdiction. 150 CA 68."

In latter case, plaintiff cannot demand that other counsel be appointed if new counsel also concludes that there is no substantial error which he can assign on appeal. Id., 505.

A continuance may be granted upon such conditions and with such provision for temporary relief as the court orders.\n\n(c) If, after hearing, the court is of the opinion that the plaintiffs are entitled to relief, it may make such order for the discontinuance or abatement of the nuisance, or for regulating the manner of conducting the business, as it finds to be necessary. If it appears that any such order is ineffectual to abate the nuisance or if it appears that the order is disobeyed or evaded, the court, upon such notice as it directs, may make such further order and provision for the enforcement of the original order or decree as may be deemed necessary.\n\n(d) The Superior Court, or any judge thereof when the court is not in session, may, upon complaint, issue a temporary injunction against the continuance of any such nuisance until a final hearing may be had. If it is impracticable to stay the continuance of a nuisance by a temporary injunction or if the injunction is disobeyed or evaded, the court or judge may make and enforce such temporary order for the discontinuance of the nuisance until a final hearing, as may be deemed necessary.\n\n(e) At least twenty-four hours' notice in writing of the time and place of making such a motion for temporary injunction shall be given to the defendants or some of them, if they are known and can be found in this state, and, if not, shall be left with the person in charge of the premises, if such person can be found.\n\nSee Sec. 52-253 re costs in suits against manufacturers for nuisance."

Trial court improperly instructed jury on statute of frauds when it instructed jury that it could find that an exception to statute of frauds applied if it found that plaintiffs had proved either part performance of contract or detrimental reliance induced by defendant; although this court has occasionally used the terms interchangeably, it never intended that doctrines of equitable estoppel and of part performance operate as independent exceptions to statute of frauds; part performance is an essential element of the estoppel exception to statute of frauds. 274 C. 33. Statute of frauds, which governs disputes between parties to a contract, not applicable to case involving oral lease agreement because it did not involve a “contractual dispute”. 278 C. 660. Re action for specific performance on option to purchase real property where no written agreement existed for purchase price because cost of environmental remediation had not been determined, part performance of parties did not remove option from statute of frauds and did not provide remedy for specific performance. 293 C. 287."

In such an action, the administrator does not act in his true capacity as administrator for the benefit of the estate but as agent or trustee for those beneficially interested; proceeds do not become general assets of the estate. 147 C. 233. Right of action for wrongful death and that for nonfatal personal injuries rest on substantially the same basis; administrator of unemancipated minor may sue her unemancipated minor sister for wrongful death. Id., 649. Damages for death and its direct consequences are recoverable only if, and to the extent that, they are made so by statute. 153 C. 360. Cited. Id., 633. Plaintiff stands in shoes of decedent and can recover only if he, had his injuries not proved fatal, could himself have recovered. 154 C. 432. As executor, plaintiff is empowered to sue for injuries resulting in decedent's death whether his appointment issued from a court in this state or in a foreign jurisdiction. 156 C. 115.

Permits a recovery of death damages only by decedent's estate; claim for loss of ante mortem consortium distinguished from claim for loss of post mortem consortium. Id., 187. 3-year limitation is a jurisdictional prerequisite which must be met to maintain action under statute and cannot be waived; statute does not violate Art. I, Sec. 10 of Connecticut Constitution. 205 C. 219. Intent is not an essential element of the cause of action. 206 C. 229.

The limitations period set forth in section must be read in conjunction with the savings statute, Sec. 52-592, such that the time limitation contained in the savings statute modifies the time limitation contained in this section. 323 C. 741. The continuing course of conduct and continuing course of treatment doctrines apply to the cause of action created by section. 330 C. 251. Section does not create a new cause of action, but rather merely allows the administrator of an estate to append to an already valid claim an additional element of damages consisting of costs associated with the decedent's death; a cause of action for wrongful death predicated on CUTPA will lie only insofar as the decedent, had he or she survived, could have satisfied all essential elements of the CUTPA claim, including the statute of limitations. 331 C. 53."

Fact that person injured died more than a year after injury immaterial where original complaint was brought within statutory period. Id., 413; Id., 468. Cited. 16 CS 430; 17 CS 3. Covers both antemortem elements of damage such as pain and suffering and also for injuries resulting in death. 19 CS 487. Connecticut's wrongful death statute compared with that of North Carolina, which is based on Lord Campbell's Act. 21 CS 233. Where prenatal injuries result in death, the personal representative of the child may prosecute an action; it makes no difference whether death took place just after birth or just prior to birth. 23 CS 256. Stillborn infant, dead from injuries sustained as a viable fetus, has a cause of action; Connecticut follows the “survival” rather than the “new cause of action” theory. 26 CS 358. Damages for antemortem injuries, though required to be claimed in same action as damages for death, do not depend on this section but on Sec. 52-599, which provides that decedent's cause of action survives to his personal representative; where 1-year period of limitation with respect to those injuries had not expired when decedent died, his personal representative, under Sec. 52-594, had year from date of death to initiate action. 28 CS 461. Wrongful death action must be brought by executor or administrator to have standing; standing acquired subsequent to statute of limitations does not cure original action. 29 CS 139. Amendment to complaint not deemed instituting new cause of action so as to be barred by section but was amplification and expansion not change of facts originally claimed. 35 CS 38. Wrongful death action is not a new and independent action created by the demise of the injured party, but rather a claim of the deceased party which survives his death; therefore decedent's spouse can attach to the wrongful death claim an independent claim for loss of consortium; loss of consortium is now legally recoverable under “just damages”; consortium is an element of a marital relationship and cannot be extended to the children of the marriage. Id., 292. Cited. 37 CS 1; 38 CS 318. Damages for loss of consortium are not recoverable under statute, which compensates losses suffered only by decedent or his estate. 39 CS 8. Cited. 40 CS 95. Read together with Secs. 45-249c and 45-249d(a), “executor or administrator” is interpreted to include a temporary administrator to be allowed to commence wrongful death action when necessary to preserve estate. Id., 451. Cited. Id., 457; 44 CS 477. Administratrix may maintain action for wrongful death on behalf of a viable unborn fetus for injuries and death. 48 CS 440. Section is sole basis upon which an action that includes as an element of damages a person's death or its consequences can be brought, and where damages for wrongful death are sought, the statute of limitations in section, rather than for torts or negligence generally, applies. 52 CS 435; judgment affirmed, see 139 CA 88."

State's waiver of sovereign immunity pursuant to section does not exempt the state from a reallocation of damages under Sec. 52-572h(g). 247 C. 256. Reiterated previous holdings that operation of motor vehicle encompasses both parking incidental to travel and movement where essential element is location of motor vehicle in travel lane. 287 C. 421. Section inapplicable where state not made a party to negligence action; court does not have authority to treat an action against a state employee as one against state. 297 C. 317. “Damages” does not include postjudgment interest, and state did not waive sovereign immunity with regard to postjudgment interest under Sec. 37-3b. Id., 798. When the state, by statute, waives its immunity to suit, the right to a jury trial cannot be implied, but instead must be affirmatively expressed; section does not expressly provide for a right to a jury trial, therefore there is no right to a jury trial brought under section. 330 C. 138. The phrase “any person” signifies that waiver applies without restriction to persons who are injured under circumstances specified in section and therefore extends to state employees, but does not preclude state from asserting against such state employees a defense to liability based on workers' compensation exclusivity provision in Sec. 31-284(a). 336 C. 669."

(1)(B) codifies common law rule that municipalities are liable for their negligent acts committed in their proprietary capacity. 279 C. 830. Appellate Court improperly concluded that plaintiff, the mother of a 6-year-old child attending after school program located within a public school, fell within identifiable person, imminent harm exception to governmental immunity; only persons recognized for purposes of exception are school children attending public schools during school hours. 284 C. 91. Subdiv. (2)(B): Governmental immunity applicable to defendants, board of education and certain public school officials, because plaintiff, a summer program supervisor who slipped on urine in the school bathroom where program was located, was not an identifiable person subject to imminent harm because the potential for harm was neither sufficiently immediate nor sufficiently certain. 294 C. 265. Subdiv. (1)(A): The identifiable person, imminent harm common-law exception to municipal employee's qualified immunity is also applicable in an action brought directly against a municipality under Subdiv., regardless of whether an employee or officer of municipality is also a named defendant; plaintiff resident who was injured at transfer station was not a member of a class of foreseeable victims because he was not legally required to dispose of his refuse by taking it to transfer station and could have hired an independent contractor to do so. Id., 324. Subdiv. (1)(C): Trial court properly struck plaintiffs' claims asserted pursuant to Subpara. (C) on grounds that defendants may not be held liable for damages caused by their failure to act to abate an alleged public nuisance because Subpara. (C) contains a positive act requirement. 295 C. 141. Common law identifiable person, imminent harm exception to governmental immunity for discretionary acts applicable in action solely against municipality under Subdiv. (1)(A). 296 C. 518. Subdiv. (1)(A) is grounded in common law negligence cause of action and does not create a new kind of cause of action, but provides that political subdivisions may be held liable for certain common law negligence claims against them and their employees; negligence claims against chaperones at a school dance are barred by doctrine of qualified immunity because such chaperones were performing governmental acts, were acting in the exercise of discretion and no exception applied. 301 C. 112. Subdiv. (1): Town is protected by governmental immunity and duty to warn of hazardous conditions is discretionary; failure to allege town owned or controlled land the use of which unreasonably interfered with plaintiffs' use or enjoyment of their property does not render nuisance claim insufficient, but motion to strike nuisance claim properly granted because plaintiffs could not have alleged facts sufficient to establish town created or participated in creating alleged nuisance or had duty to warn of risks. 307 C. 364. Subdiv. (1): Pertains only to municipal roads and bridges and not to state roads and bridges; town may be liable for nuisance on state highway if nuisance was created by the town; legislature sought to ensure that a person who sustains injuries or property damage as a result of a nuisance created by a municipality may recover against the municipality either by way of an action sounding in nuisance or, if the nuisance was created on a road or bridge that the municipality was legally responsible for maintaining, under Sec. 13a-149. Id., 620. Specially chartered municipal corporation water supply company liable for negligent conduct when bicyclist rode her bike into gate on company property; gate was maintained in an unsafe and dangerous condition and maintenance of gate was inextricably linked to proprietary function of operating the company. 309 C. 282. Subdiv. (2): Town not liable under identifiable person/imminent harm exception for injuries sustained by passenger in vehicle pursued by volunteer firefighter while firefighter was on telephone call with town's 911 dispatcher where it was not apparent to dispatcher that firefighter was pursuing vehicle at excessive rate of speed and improperly using blue courtesy lights that were similar to police lights, and that dispatcher's response or lack thereof likely would have subjected the passenger to imminent harm. 311 C. 217. Police officers' duty to remain at the scene of a domestic violence incident was discretionary and not ministerial, therefore defendant municipality is entitled to governmental immunity. 312 C. 150. Under identifiable person-imminent harm exception to governmental immunity, the standard to determine whether harm was imminent is whether it was apparent to municipal defendant that the dangerous condition was so likely to cause harm that defendant had a clear and unequivocal duty to act immediately to prevent harm. 314 C. 303. Municipal immunity was not abrogated under Subdiv. (1)(B) by proprietary function exception because defendant's operation of pool was for general public purpose, did not result in excess revenues and was used by private company only for short periods of time without any formal lease or contract, and was not abrogated under Subdiv. (1)(A) by application of the identifiable person, imminent harm exception because plaintiff was not compelled to attend aqua therapy sessions offered by private company at defendant's pool, and therefore was not an identifiable person. 326 C. 420. Whether a statute, regulation or other provision of law creates a ministerial duty ordinarily presents a question of law to be decided by the court. 330 C. 613. The fact that a police officer, either by training or experience, ordinarily responds to a situation in a particular manner does not transform his or her response into a ministerial duty. Id. Subdiv. (2)(B): Mandatory reporting of abuse pursuant to Sec. 17a-101a et seq. is a ministerial duty rather than a discretionary duty. 340 C. 1. Subdiv. (1): By its express terms, section waives a municipal corporation's governmental immunity “for damages to persons or property”, but not for purely economic or commercial losses. Id., 200. The defense of discretionary act immunity does not apply to claims arising from the manner in which an emergency vehicle is operated under the privileges provided by Sec. 14-283. 347 C. 416."

Language of section is clear and unambiguous in abrogating governmental immunity that common law gives to municipalities with respect to vicarious liability; parties need not comply with filing requirements of Sec. 7-465 in order to utilize this section, rather parties can bring a direct cause of action for negligence against a municipality under its provisions. 66 CA 669. Although trial court improperly analyzed plaintiff's claims under Subsec., which concerns claims brought directly against a municipality, rather than under applicable municipal indemnification statute, Sec. 7-465, which provides that qualified municipal immunity does not apply to claims for indemnification for acts by municipal employees unless the acts are willful or wanton, she could not prevail on claim that trial court improperly granted motion for a directed verdict because there is no recognized right to a claim for emotional distress resulting to a person from loss of a pet. 84 CA 395. Trial court properly struck plaintiffs' negligence claim where plaintiffs claimed that city's negligence in failing to ensure security of the building after city had taken the property by eminent domain resulted in plaintiffs property being stolen and destroyed; pursuant to Subdiv. (2)(B) city cannot be held liable for the actions of its employees pertaining to security of the property. 88 CA 1. Because municipal status of city of New Haven was undisputed, the protection afforded under Subdiv. (2)(A) granted municipal immunity from liability for intentional tort committed by plaintiff's coemployee who was a city employee. 92 CA 558. Subdiv. (2)(A): A municipality may not be held liable for the intentional acts of its employees including the intentional infliction of emotional distress. 108 CA 710. When a law enforcement officer has been ordered by the court to vacate an arrest warrant, this is a mandatory duty; failure to do so may not be excused by governmental immunity. 110 CA 389. Section codifies the common law doctrine of qualified immunity; defendants, a municipality and police officers employed by the municipality, were entitled to qualified immunity in the performance of discretionary duties relating to the monitoring of an individual who committed suicide while being held in police department lock-up area. 120 CA 282. Decedent's estate could not prevail against police officers because of doctrine of governmental immunity since complaint did not demonstrate that decedent was an identifiable and foreseeable victim subject to imminent harm. Id., 806. Subdiv. (2)(B): Trial court's conclusion that statutes, regulations and policies are most often held to create discretionary duties was overreaching; because standards exist for town firefighters to secure traffic accident scene in prescribed manner without the exercise of judgment or discretion, plaintiff's negligence action against town arose out of violations of ministerial rather than discretionary duties, and trial court improperly granted town's motion to strike on grounds of governmental immunity. 127 CA 254; judgment affirmed, see 307 C. 620. Subdiv. (2)(A): Neither the distinction between ministerial and discretionary acts nor the exceptions to discretionary act immunity factor into an analysis of governmental immunity when an intentional cause of action is alleged; the term “wilful” is synonymous with “intentional”; provision makes no distinction between ministerial and discretionary acts. 133 CA 215. City was immune from indemnity claim re fatal shooting at carnival because language in Sec. 7-284 concerning police protection at places of amusement describes a discretionary function, not a ministerial duty, and billing of operator for such police protection did not convert governmental function of providing security into a proprietary function. 138 CA 40. Subdiv. (1)(A): Police action was discretionary re homicide victim killed by domestic violence perpetrator while in the household of a person who was protected by an order of protection because the victim was not the person protected by the order of protection and law enforcement directives adopted under Sec. 46b-38b re domestic violence victims did not impose a duty re victim. 140 CA 315; judgment affirmed, see 312 C. 150. Police officer's decisions whether or not to enforce certain statutes and to take other actions in securing traffic accident scene requires exercise of judgment and discretion and, therefore, entitles officer to governmental immunity. 142 CA 113. Subdiv. (1)(C): A public nuisance claim may not be brought independently of Sec. 13a-149 when plaintiff's claim for damages against a municipality resulted from an injury sustained by means of a defective municipal road. 150 CA 805. Subdiv. (2)(B): School superintendent's manner of communicating plaintiff's termination was a discretionary act to which municipal immunity attached. 158 CA 872. Subdiv. (2)(B): Police dispatcher's statement to caller that police officer would respond shortly did not create a ministerial duty for which governmental immunity is abrogated under Subdiv. (1), and plaintiff did not present any other evidence that police response to a call is a ministerial rather than discretionary act or that plaintiff was an identifiable victim subjecting defendants to identifiable person-imminent harm exception. 163 CA 847. To the extent that the phrase “wear shin guards for additional protection” is ambiguous, and thus susceptible to different meanings, that fact alone supports a determination that the language in the school's physical education guideline was not intended to create a ministerial duty that would be a clear and unequivocal waiver of governmental immunity under Subdiv. (2). 175 CA 613."

Because count of plaintiff's complaint alleging civil theft is devoid of any factual assertion that defendants acted with the requisite intent to permanently deprive plaintiff of her property, plaintiff failed to state a cause of action for civil theft, and count is legally insufficient. 99 CA 719. Plaintiff is required to prove the actions alleged by clear and convincing evidence in order to be entitled to an award of treble damages. 112 CA 160; judgment reversed in part, see 297 C. 26. In order to prove liability under section, plaintiff only had to show that defendant engaged in conduct that was synonymous with larceny, and was not required to show that the funds had been stolen by defendant or anyone else; given defendant's knowledge concerning source and disposition of funds in question, his continued failure to return funds constituted an intentional decision on his part to deprive plaintiff of its use of funds. 136 CA 99. The essential elements plaintiffs must prove to obtain treble damages for civil theft are the same as the elements to prove larceny: (1) An intent to do the act complained of, (2) the act was done wrongfully, and (3) the act was committed against an owner. 138 CA 695. Benefit on behalf of defendant is not an element of statutory theft; an intent to deprive plaintiff of funds could be inferred from fact that defendant withdrew funds that were not used for the benefit of the beneficiary and the trust had been exhausted. 139 CA 794. Injunctive relief is not a remedy available under section and since plaintiffs have made no tuition payments there is no loss of property; no theft can occur absent the loss of property. 191 CA 360. A claim for civil theft of funds must be for specific identifiable money and cannot arise from an implied contract of unjust enrichment. 196 CA 583. There is no basis for precluding the application of absolute immunity to a statutory theft claim that does not challenge the underlying purpose of the litigation but, instead, challenges the alleged misconduct of the defendant in his role as an attorney on behalf of his client; Public policy does not support permitting claims of statutory theft against attorneys, as it would inhibit participation and candor in judicial proceedings, and have a chilling effect on the attorney-client relationship and on an attorney's zealous representation of his or her client. 198 CA 197; judgment affirmed, see 341 C. 1."

Statute applies equally to claims against private litigants and attorneys and does not suggest any basis for treating probable cause differently depending on the type of defendant against whom the action is brought, and therefore in a vexatious litigation action against a law firm, the presence or absence of probable cause should be judged by the general objective standard. 281 C. 84. Congress has occupied the field of penalties and sanctions for abuse of the bankruptcy process, implicitly preempting state law CUTPA and vexatious litigation claims; in field of bankruptcy law, the federal interest is so dominant that federal law is assumed to preclude enforcement of state laws on the subject, and even though state law actions are not in conflict with federal law, the former are still preempted under conflict preemption analysis because they are an obstacle to accomplishing Congress' purposes within the Bankruptcy Code. 333 C. 1."

Plaintiff's vexatious litigation claim based on defendant's filing of an adversary proceeding in Bankruptcy Court is preempted by federal bankruptcy law that provides sanctions for filing frivolous and malicious pleadings. 86 CA 596. Court adopted Indiana Court of Appeals' articulation of objective standard of probable cause: Standard which should govern the reasonableness of attorney's action in instituting litigation for a client is whether claim merits litigation against defendant in question on the basis of facts known to the attorney when suit is commenced; on the basis of the facts known to the law firm, a reasonable attorney familiar with the law of this state would believe that applicable statutes of limitation could be tolled by fraudulent concealment on the part of Retirement Centers. 89 CA 459. Prejudgment remedy is not a civil action for purposes of vexatious litigation. 100 CA 63. Statutory action for vexatious litigation differs from a common-law action only in that a finding of malice is not an essential element, but will serve as a basis for higher damages; trial court properly concluded that law firm did not have a proper purpose in filing a shareholder litigation suit pursuant to Sec. 33-948 to permit inspection of corporate records, where stock repurchase offer had expired prior to filing of suit. 103 CA 20. Vexatious litigation counterclaim by defendant was premature where the original lawsuit had not yet been terminated in defendant's favor at the time of pleading. 110 CA 511. Trial court's determination that certificate of good faith that was attempted to be filed in malpractice action was insufficient did not equate to determination that there was lack of probable cause to bring such action; court's finding of blatant and egregious conduct did not collaterally estop party from litigating in vexatious litigation action the question of whether there was probable cause to bring malpractice action against hospital. 144 CA 100. All counts of the underlying action must be favorably terminated for a vexatious litigation claim to be ripe. 148 CA 176. Subdivs. (1) and (2) do not constitute two separate and distinct causes of action; to prevail under either Subdiv., plaintiff must prove four elements by preponderance of evidence. 156 CA 854.

Plain language of section provides that only negligent persons may be cited in by defendant for apportionment for liability purposes and, therefore, a person whose conduct was reckless, willful and wanton is not liable pursuant to section and cannot be added for purposes of apportionment; Supreme Court extended section as matter of common law to permit apportionment between a negligent and an intentional tortfeasor. 246 C. 223. Apportionment principles of section do not apply where apportionment complaint rests on any basis other than negligence, including strict liability, of which product liability is simply a form. 253 C. 787. By enacting P.A. 99-69, Sec. 1(o), legislature merely clarified section to preclude a common law right to apportionment between a negligent and intentional tortfeasor. 263 C. 358. Because statutes allow for apportionment among negligent defendants and because Connecticut is a comparative negligence jurisdiction, as indicated by Sec. 52-572o, the simpler and less confusing approach to cases where jury must determine which, among many, causes contributed to plaintiff's injury, is to couch the analysis in proximate cause rather than allowing defendants to raise a defense of superseding cause. Id., 424. Defendant may assert under a general denial that the negligence of an employer who is not a party to the action is the sole proximate cause of plaintiff's injuries. 287 C. 20."

Action for injury to the person is governed by 1-year statute of limitations only if the injury is caused by negligence, by reckless or wanton misconduct, or by malpractice. 142 C. 452. Enactment of a statute which may bar an action even before the cause of action accrues is not beyond the power of the legislature and is consonant with the purpose of a statute of limitations which is to prevent the unexpected enforcement of stale claims concerning which the persons interested have been thrown off their guard by want of prosecution; the 1-year period of limitation starts to run at the date when defendant negligently does the act which results in damages to plaintiff. 144 C. 170.

Where improvements to real property contemplated by architect's or engineer's services are not completed because of defect complained of, Sec. 52-584a, and not this section, applies to plaintiff's cause of action. 247 C. 293. Mental suffering constitutes injury, even if unaccompanied by physical trauma to the body. 248 C. 21. Precondition of continuing course of conduct doctrine is that defendant must have committed an initial wrong upon plaintiff. 252 C. 193. Since there was a genuine issue of material fact with respect to whether the 3-year repose section contained in statute was tolled by defendant's alleged ongoing failure to warn plaintiff of his concern for cancer thus triggering the continuing course of conduct doctrine, it was improper for trial court to have concluded that there was no continuing course of conduct as a matter of law and to have granted defendant's motion for summary judgment. Id., 363. Allegations in amended complaint presented a new and different set of facts and were barred by statute of limitations since new facts did not relate back to original complaint. 257 C. 58. Does not impose a duty on plaintiff to investigate, instead, it requires jury to consider all the facts and circumstances in order to determine date when the injury is first sustained or discovered or in the exercise of reasonable care should have been discovered; does not impose a heightened standard of discovery on health care professionals regarding discovery of actionable harm. 262 C. 797. Correct legal standard by which to evaluate timeliness of causes of action in negligence restated; limitation period for actions in negligence begins to run on date when injury is first discovered or in exercise of reasonable care should have been discovered. 268 C. 723. 90-day extension provided in Sec. 52-190a(b) applies equally to both the 2-year statute of limitation and 3-year statute of repose in this section. 269 C. 787. Legislature's purpose in distinguishing “injury or actionable harm” from “the act or omission complained of” and providing a 3-year statute of repose, was to avoid “draconian effect” of running the 2-year limitation period from the date of defendant's negligence in cases in which plaintiff is unable to bring an action because he could not discover an essential jurisdictional fact, despite the exercise of reasonable care; 2-year statute of limitations set forth in statute does not begin to run until plaintiff knows or reasonably should have known the identity of the tortfeasor; plaintiff's ignorance of tortfeasor's identity will not excuse plaintiff's failure to bring a negligence action within 3 years of the date of the act or omission complained of. 271 C. 284. Plaintiff failed to demonstrate that two isolated contacts with two different radiologists at same hospital over the course of 3 years constituted a continuing course of conduct or treatment so as to toll the statute of limitations set forth in section for the purpose of allowing plaintiff to pursue a medical malpractice claim against the hospital for failing to discover her brain tumor. 279 C. 312. Plaintiff parents' claims against gynecologist delivering their infant were barred by the 3-year repose provision in statute; there was no genuine issue of material fact that gynecologist was not under a continuing duty to warn plaintiff parents of potential complications associated with respiratory distress syndrome because gynecologist ceased to be infant's treating physician after his birth; responsibility for infant's care and treatment after his birth was assumed by another physician who diagnosed infant as having the syndrome, and any legal duty that gynecologist had re infant prior to delivery concluded upon date of his birth; imposition on delivering hospital of a continuing duty to inform plaintiff parents of all potential complications associated with infant's diagnosis regardless of his treating physician's actual knowledge would nullify the 3-year repose provision established by legislature for medical malpractice actions; continuing course of conduct doctrine did not toll such repose provision. 280 C. 190. Continuous treatment doctrine did not apply to bar statute of limitations. 282 C. 745. Action was not time barred because there were disputed facts sufficient to warrant the invocation of continuing course of conduct doctrine. 287 C. 158. Evidence that defendant should have been aware or that defendant deviated from the standard of care does not amount to actual knowledge to impose a continuing duty on defendant so that the period of repose is tolled under continuous course of conduct doctrine; evidence must be submitted to prove the existence of a physician-patient relationship or ongoing course of treatment by defendant in order to properly toll the period of repose under continuing treatment doctrine. 290 C. 347. Doctrine of nullum tempus occurrit regi, i.e. no time runs against the king, exempts state from operation of section. 307 C. 412. Routine postoperative appointments for the purposes of tracking the progress of plaintiff's condition and postoperative complications, if any, constitute continuing course of treatment for any identified medical condition that was caused by the surgery. 321 C. 637. The relation back doctrine applies to a proposed new or changed allegation of negligence when it falls within the scope of the original cause of action, which is the transaction or occurrence underpinning plaintiff's legal claim against defendant. 325 C. 198. The plaintiff's knowledge of the causal connection between the defendants' alleged negligence and her physical harm is a material fact because it begins the accrual of statute of limitation; legislative history supports conclusion that “injury” as used in statute was intended to mean a legally recognized injury, not just physical hurt or loss. 342 C. 103."

Service of prejudgment remedy document did not toll the running of section, even though contained the words “the institution of this action” and included unsigned proposed writ of summons and complaint, since unsigned writ and complaint does not have effect of commencing a civil action; court declined to adopt rule that section is tolled when prejudgment remedy documents are served. 61 CA 234.

Statute of limitations not tolled by continuous course of conduct doctrine where pathology group failed to diagnose plaintiff's disease, because to expect pathology group to provide follow-up treatment or to instruct patient on follow-up care after a negative diagnosis when there is no awareness that the diagnosis is wrong and there is no ongoing relationship is beyond the expectation of public policy. 66 CA 518. Because plaintiff failed to offer any evidence to demonstrate that defendant physician had an awareness of risk to plaintiff subsequent to the surgical sterilization procedure, plaintiff could not establish that defendant had a continuing duty to warn her so as to toll the limitation period of statute. 67 CA 565. Although genuine issue of material fact existed re defendant's initial alleged negligence, trial court properly granted defendant's motion for summary judgment because plaintiff failed to prove that defendant physician was aware of a risk to plaintiff that would have triggered a continuing duty to warn her so as to toll the limitation period of statute. Id., 576. Statutes of limitation are not tolled by an automatic bankruptcy stay; pursuant to federal law, if the statute of limitations expires during the automatic bankruptcy stay, plaintiff has 30 days from notice of termination or expiration of the stay within which to commence an action. 68 CA 79. Where defendant negligently misidentified plaintiff's property as belonging to another, the case concerns negligent injury to property and therefore statute of limitations in section applies rather than the 3-year limitation set forth in Sec. 52-577. 79 CA 290. Doctrines of continuous treatment and continuing course of conduct apply, as a matter of law, only to 3-year limitation period and do not apply to toll time period for discovery portion of statute. 82 CA 396. Claim cast in contractual language subject to 3-year period of statute because, in light of noneconomic relief sought, it more closely resembles claim based on tortious conduct arising out of negligent performance or nonperformance of contractual duty than claim for breach of contract. 84 CA 1. Sheriff's attempt to serve defendant with process before he fled and subsequent service in defendant's mailbox were sufficient to constitute good faith efforts at compliance when defendant was clearly evading service. 93 CA 76. Once plaintiff became aware of her injuries on date of fall, statute of limitations began to run and, because the statute was not tolled, plaintiff was required to bring action within 2 years from date of discovery. 141 CA 282. Statute of limitations not tolled by common-law holiday rule for service of process to state marshals, as they are independent contractors and not state employees subject to mandatory closure on state holidays. 153 CA 563. “Foreign object exception” to statute of repose not recognized in Connecticut; statute of repose does not violate open courts provision of Connecticut Constitution, Art. I, Sec. 10. 154 CA 1.

Plaintiff not eligible for relief under section since she withdrew her action in favor of a settlement and did not obtain judgment in the original action. 83 CA 843. Plaintiff's initial failure to name all presumptively factually correct defendants, whom plaintiff eventually did name, did not constitute failure to name the right person as defendant under section. 123 CA 583; judgment reversed on alternate grounds, see 306 C. 107. No exception to the principles of res judicata for an action brought under section. 165 CA 857."
