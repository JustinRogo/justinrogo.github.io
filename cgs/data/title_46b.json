              "(a) Any family or household member, as defined in section 46b-38a , who is the victim of domestic violence, as defined in section 46b-1 , by another family or household member may make an application to the Superior Court for relief under this section. The court shall provide any person who applies for relief under this section with the information set forth in section 46b-15b .",
              "(b) The application form shall allow the applicant, at the applicant's option, to indicate whether the respondent holds a permit to carry a pistol or revolver, an eligibility certificate for a pistol or revolver, a long gun eligibility certificate or an ammunition certificate or possesses one or more firearms or ammunition. The application shall be accompanied by an affidavit made under oath which includes a brief statement of the conditions from which relief is sought. Upon receipt of the application the court shall order that a hearing on the application be held not later than fourteen days from the date of the order except that, if the application indicates that the respondent holds a permit to carry a pistol or revolver, an eligibility certificate for a pistol or revolver, a long gun eligibility certificate or an ammunition certificate or possesses one or more firearms or ammunition, and the court orders an ex parte order, the court shall order that a hearing be held on the application not later than seven days from the date on which the ex parte order is issued. The court, in its discretion, may make such orders as it deems appropriate for the protection of the applicant and such dependent children or other persons as the court sees fit. In making such orders ex parte, the court, in its discretion, may consider relevant court records if the records are available to the public from a clerk of the Superior Court or on the Judicial Branch's Internet web site. In addition, at the time of the hearing, the court, in its discretion, may also consider a report prepared by the family services unit of the Judicial Branch, provided the person who prepared such report is available to testify at the hearing and is subject to cross examination. The report may include, as available: Any existing or prior orders of protection obtained from the protection order registry; information on any pending criminal case or past criminal case in which the respondent was convicted of a violent crime; any outstanding arrest warrant for the respondent; and the respondent's level of risk based on a risk assessment tool utilized by the Court Support Services Division. The report may also include information pertaining to any pending or disposed family matters case involving the applicant and respondent.

Such orders may include temporary child custody or visitation rights, and such relief may include, but is not limited to, an order enjoining the respondent from (1) imposing any restraint upon the person or liberty of the applicant; (2) threatening, harassing, assaulting, molesting, sexually assaulting or attacking the applicant; or (3) entering the family dwelling or the dwelling of the applicant. Such order may include provisions necessary to protect any animal owned or kept by the applicant including, but not limited to, an order enjoining the respondent from injuring or threatening to injure such animal. If an applicant alleges an immediate and present physical danger to the applicant, the court may issue an ex parte order granting such relief as it deems appropriate. If a postponement of a hearing on the application is requested by either party and granted, the ex parte order shall not be continued except upon agreement of the parties or by order of the court for good cause shown. If a hearing on the application is scheduled or an ex parte order is granted and the court is closed on the scheduled hearing date, the hearing shall be held on the next day the court is open and any such ex parte order shall remain in effect until the date of such hearing. If the applicant is under eighteen years of age, a parent, guardian or responsible adult who brings the application as next friend of the applicant may not speak on the applicant's behalf at such hearing unless there is good cause shown as to why the applicant is unable to speak on his or her own behalf, except that nothing in this subsection shall preclude such parent, guardian or responsible adult from testifying as a witness at such hearing. As used in this subsection, “violent crime” includes: (A) An incident resulting in physical harm, bodily injury or assault; (B) an act of threatened violence that constitutes fear of imminent physical harm, bodily injury or assault, including, but not limited to, stalking or a pattern of threatening; (C) verbal abuse or argument if there is a present danger and likelihood that physical violence will occur; and (D) cruelty to animals as set forth in section 53-247 .",
              "(c) If the court issues an ex parte order pursuant to subsection (b) of this section and service has not been made on the respondent in conformance with subsection (h) of this section, upon request of the applicant, the court shall, based on the information contained in the original application, extend any ex parte order for an additional period not to exceed fourteen days from the originally scheduled hearing date. The clerk shall prepare a new order of hearing and notice containing the new hearing date, which shall be served upon the respondent in accordance with the provisions of subsection (h) of this section.",
              "(d) Any ex parte restraining order entered under subsection (b) of this section in which the applicant and respondent are spouses, or persons who have a dependent child or children in common and who live together, may include, if no order exists, and if necessary to maintain the safety and basic needs of the applicant or the dependent child or children in common of the applicant and respondent, in addition to any orders authorized under subsection (b) of this section, any of the following: (1) An order prohibiting the respondent from (A) taking any action that could result in the termination of any necessary utility services or necessary services related to the family dwelling or the dwelling of the applicant, (B) taking any action that could result in the cancellation, change of coverage or change of beneficiary of any health, automobile or homeowners insurance policy to the detriment of the applicant or the dependent child or children in common of the applicant and respondent, or (C) transferring, encumbering, concealing or disposing of specified property owned or leased by the applicant; or (2) an order providing the applicant with temporary possession of an automobile, checkbook, documentation of health, automobile or homeowners insurance, a document needed for purposes of proving identity, a key or other necessary specified personal effects.",

The court shall not enter any order of financial support without sufficient evidence as to the ability to pay, including, but not limited to, financial affidavits. If at the hearing no order is entered under this subsection or subsection (d) of this section, no such order may be entered thereafter pursuant to this section. Any order entered pursuant to this subsection shall not be subject to modification and shall expire one hundred twenty days after the date of issuance or upon issuance of a superseding order, whichever occurs first. Any amounts not paid or collected under this subsection or subsection (d) of this section may be preserved and collectible in an action for dissolution of marriage, custody, paternity or support.",
              "(f) (1) Every order of the court made in accordance with this section shall contain the following language: (A) “This order may be extended by the court beyond one year. In accordance with section 53a-107 of the Connecticut general statutes, entering or remaining in a building or any other premises in violation of this order constitutes criminal trespass in the first degree. This is a criminal offense punishable by a term of imprisonment of not more than one year, a fine of not more than two thousand dollars or both.”; and (B) “In accordance with section 53a-223b of the Connecticut general statutes, any violation of subparagraph (A) or (B) of subdivision (2) of subsection (a) of section 53a-223b constitutes criminal violation of a restraining order which is punishable by a term of imprisonment of not more than five years, a fine of not more than five thousand dollars, or both. Additionally, any violation of subparagraph (C) or (D) of subdivision (2) of subsection (a) of section 53a-223b constitutes criminal violation of a restraining order which is punishable by a term of imprisonment of not more than ten years, a fine of not more than ten thousand dollars, or both.”.",
              "(2) Each applicant who receives an order of the court in accordance with this section shall be given a notice that contains the following language: “If a restraining order has been issued on your behalf or on behalf of your child, you may elect to give testimony or appear in a family court proceeding remotely, pursuant to section 46b-15c . Please notify the court in writing at least two days in advance of a proceeding if you choose to give testimony or appear remotely, and your physical presence in the courthouse will not be required in order to participate in the court proceeding.”.",
              "(g) No order of the court shall exceed one year, except that an order may be extended by the court upon motion of the applicant for such additional time as the court deems necessary. If the respondent has not appeared upon the initial application, service of a motion to extend an order may be made by first-class mail directed to the respondent at the respondent's last-known address.",
              "(h) (1) The applicant shall cause notice of the hearing pursuant to subsection (b) of this section and a copy of the application and the applicant's affidavit and of any ex parte order issued pursuant to subsection (b) of this section to be served on the respondent not less than three days before the hearing. A proper officer responsible for executing such service shall accept all documents in an electronic format, if presented to such officer in such format. The cost of such service, including mileage pursuant to section 52-261 , shall be paid for by the Judicial Branch. No officer or person shall be entitled to a fee for service pursuant to this section if timely return of service is not received by the court, absent a court order authorizing such fee.

Trial court did not exceed its statutory authority when it ordered alcohol abuse counseling since it could reasonably have concluded that such counseling was necessary for the protection of the family, and did not exceed its statutory authority by extending restraining order to protect adult daughter since section allows orders appropriate for the protection of other persons as the court sees fit. 127 CA 586. Provision that “the court may impose such sanctions as the court deems appropriate” is ambiguous, and incarceration was not an appropriate sanction in a civil contempt proceeding for violation of a domestic restraining order where incarceration would not allow a contemnor to avoid or lessen the sentence of incarceration by purging himself of the contempt. 143 CA 1. The word “stalking” is to be construed according to its commonly approved usage, as opposed to the narrower definitions of stalking found in the Penal Code; trial court did not abuse its discretion in concluding in the context of all of the evidence that defendant's conduct in driving past plaintiff's home, turning around, and driving past the home a second time constituted an act of stalking. 150 CA 105. Because section is silent as to the applicable standard of proof, the preponderance of the evidence standard applies for the granting of a civil restraining order. 191 CA 850. Although a court may consider the subjective reaction of an alleged victim, the court must apply an objective standard in assessing a pattern of threatening. 214 CA 821.

The court shall provide any person who applies for relief under this section with the information set forth in section 46b-15b .\n\n(b) The application form shall allow the applicant, at the applicant's option, to indicate whether the respondent holds a permit to carry a pistol or revolver, an eligibility certificate for a pistol or revolver, a long gun eligibility certificate or an ammunition certificate or possesses one or more firearms or ammunition. The application shall be accompanied by an affidavit made under oath which includes a brief statement of the conditions from which relief is sought.

The court, in its discretion, may make such orders as it deems appropriate for the protection of the applicant and such dependent children or other persons as the court sees fit. In making such orders ex parte, the court, in its discretion, may consider relevant court records if the records are available to the public from a clerk of the Superior Court or on the Judicial Branch's Internet web site. In addition, at the time of the hearing, the court, in its discretion, may also consider a report prepared by the family services unit of the Judicial Branch, provided the person who prepared such report is available to testify at the hearing and is subject to cross examination. The report may include, as available: Any existing or prior orders of protection obtained from the protection order registry; information on any pending criminal case or past criminal case in which the respondent was convicted of a violent crime; any outstanding arrest warrant for the respondent; and the respondent's level of risk based on a risk assessment tool utilized by the Court Support Services Division.

Such order may include provisions necessary to protect any animal owned or kept by the applicant including, but not limited to, an order enjoining the respondent from injuring or threatening to injure such animal. If an applicant alleges an immediate and present physical danger to the applicant, the court may issue an ex parte order granting such relief as it deems appropriate. If a postponement of a hearing on the application is requested by either party and granted, the ex parte order shall not be continued except upon agreement of the parties or by order of the court for good cause shown. If a hearing on the application is scheduled or an ex parte order is granted and the court is closed on the scheduled hearing date, the hearing shall be held on the next day the court is open and any such ex parte order shall remain in effect until the date of such hearing. If the applicant is under eighteen years of age, a parent, guardian or responsible adult who brings the application as next friend of the applicant may not speak on the applicant's behalf at such hearing unless there is good cause shown as to why the applicant is unable to speak on his or her own behalf, except that nothing in this subsection shall preclude such parent, guardian or responsible adult from testifying as a witness at such hearing. As used in this subsection, “violent crime” includes: (A) An incident resulting in physical harm, bodily injury or assault; (B) an act of threatened violence that constitutes fear of imminent physical harm, bodily injury or assault, including, but not limited to, stalking or a pattern of threatening; (C) verbal abuse or argument if there is a present danger and likelihood that physical violence will occur; and (D) cruelty to animals as set forth in section 53-247 .\n\n(c) If the court issues an ex parte order pursuant to subsection (b) of this section and service has not been made on the respondent in conformance with subsection (h) of this section, upon request of the applicant, the court shall, based on the information contained in the original application, extend any ex parte order for an additional period not to exceed fourteen days from the originally scheduled hearing date. The clerk shall prepare a new order of hearing and notice containing the new hearing date, which shall be served upon the respondent in accordance with the provisions of subsection (h) of this section.\n\n(d) Any ex parte restraining order entered under subsection (b) of this section in which the applicant and respondent are spouses, or persons who have a dependent child or children in common and who live together, may include, if no order exists, and if necessary to maintain the safety and basic needs of the applicant or the dependent child or children in common of the applicant and respondent, in addition to any orders authorized under subsection (b) of this section, any of the following: (1) An order prohibiting the respondent from (A) taking any action that could result in the termination of any necessary utility services or necessary services related to the family dwelling or the dwelling of the applicant, (B) taking any action that could result in the cancellation, change of coverage or change of beneficiary of any health, automobile or homeowners insurance policy to the detriment of the applicant or the dependent child or children in common of the applicant and respondent, or (C) transferring, encumbering, concealing or disposing of specified property owned or leased by the applicant; or (2) an order providing the applicant with temporary possession of an automobile, checkbook, documentation of health, automobile or homeowners insurance, a document needed for purposes of proving identity, a key or other necessary specified personal effects.\n\n(e) At the hearing on any application under this section, if the court grants relief pursuant to subsection (b) of this section and the applicant and respondent are spouses, or persons who have a dependent child or children in common and who live together, and if necessary to maintain the safety and basic needs of the applicant or the dependent child or children in common of the applicant and respondent, any orders entered by the court may include, in addition to the orders authorized under subsection (b) of this section, any of the following: (1) An order prohibiting the respondent from (A) taking any action that could result in the termination of any necessary utility services or services related to the family dwelling or the dwelling of the applicant, (B) taking any action that could result in the cancellation, change of coverage or change of beneficiary of any health, automobile or homeowners insurance policy to the detriment of the applicant or the dependent child or children in common of the applicant and respondent, or (C) transferring, encumbering, concealing or disposing of specified property owned or leased by the applicant; (2) an order providing the applicant with temporary possession of an automobile, checkbook, documentation of health, automobile or homeowners insurance, a document needed for purposes of proving identity, a key or other necessary specified personal effects; or (3) an order that the respondent: (A) Make rent or mortgage payments on the family dwelling or the dwelling of the applicant and the dependent child or children in common of the applicant and respondent, (B) maintain utility services or other necessary services related to the family dwelling or the dwelling of the applicant and the dependent child or children in common of the applicant and respondent, (C) maintain all existing health, automobile or homeowners insurance coverage without change in coverage or beneficiary designation, or (D) provide financial support for the benefit of any dependent child or children in common of the applicant and the respondent, provided the respondent has a legal duty to support such child or children and the ability to pay. The court shall not enter any order of financial support without sufficient evidence as to the ability to pay, including, but not limited to, financial affidavits.

In accordance with section 53a-107 of the Connecticut general statutes, entering or remaining in a building or any other premises in violation of this order constitutes criminal trespass in the first degree. This is a criminal offense punishable by a term of imprisonment of not more than one year, a fine of not more than two thousand dollars or both.”; and (B) “In accordance with section 53a-223b of the Connecticut general statutes, any violation of subparagraph (A) or (B) of subdivision (2) of subsection (a) of section 53a-223b constitutes criminal violation of a restraining order which is punishable by a term of imprisonment of not more than five years, a fine of not more than five thousand dollars, or both.

Please notify the court in writing at least two days in advance of a proceeding if you choose to give testimony or appear remotely, and your physical presence in the courthouse will not be required in order to participate in the court proceeding.”.\n\n(g) No order of the court shall exceed one year, except that an order may be extended by the court upon motion of the applicant for such additional time as the court deems necessary. If the respondent has not appeared upon the initial application, service of a motion to extend an order may be made by first-class mail directed to the respondent at the respondent's last-known address.\n\n(h) (1) The applicant shall cause notice of the hearing pursuant to subsection (b) of this section and a copy of the application and the applicant's affidavit and of any ex parte order issued pursuant to subsection (b) of this section to be served on the respondent not less than three days before the hearing.

Such orders may include, but are not limited to, an order enjoining the respondent from: (1) Imposing any restraint upon the person or liberty of the applicant; (2) threatening, harassing, assaulting, molesting, sexually assaulting or attacking the applicant; and (3) entering the dwelling of the applicant.\n\n(c) No order of the court shall exceed one year, except that an order may be extended by the court upon proper motion of the applicant, provided a copy of the motion has been served by a proper officer on the respondent, no other order of protection based on the same facts and circumstances is in place and the need for protection, consistent with subsection (a) of this section, still exists.\n\n(d) The applicant shall cause notice of the hearing pursuant to subsection (b) of this section and a copy of the application and the applicant's affidavit and of any ex parte order issued pursuant to subsection (b) of this section to be served by a proper officer on the respondent not less than five days before the hearing. The cost of such service, including mileage pursuant to section 52-261 , shall be paid for by the Judicial Branch. Upon the granting of an ex parte order, the clerk of the court shall provide two copies of the order to the applicant. No officer or person shall be entitled to a fee for service pursuant to this section if timely return of service is not received by the court, absent a court order authorizing such fee. For the purposes of this subsection, timely return includes, but is not limited to, transmitting by facsimile or other means, a copy of the return of service to the court prior to the hearing followed by the delivery of the original return to the court within a reasonable time after the hearing. Upon the granting of an order after notice and hearing, the clerk of the court shall provide two copies of the order to the applicant and a copy to the respondent. Every order of the court made in accordance with this section after notice and hearing shall be accompanied by a notification that is consistent with the full faith and credit provisions set forth in 18 USC 2265(a), as amended from time to time. Immediately after making service on the respondent, the proper officer shall (1) send or cause to be sent, by facsimile or other means, a copy of the application, or the information contained in such application, stating the date and time the respondent was served, to the law enforcement agency or agencies for the town in which the applicant resides, the town in which the applicant is employed and the town in which the respondent resides, and (2) as soon as possible, but not later than two hours after the time that service is executed, input into the Judicial Branch's Internet-based service tracking system the date, time and method of service. If, prior to the date of the scheduled hearing, service has not been executed, the proper officer shall input into such service tracking system that service was unsuccessful. The clerk of the court shall send, by facsimile or other means, a copy of any ex parte order and of any order after notice and hearing, or the information contained in any such order, to the law enforcement agency or agencies for the town in which the applicant resides, the town in which the applicant is employed and the town in which the respondent resides, not later than forty-eight hours after the issuance of such order, and immediately to the Commissioner of Emergency Services and Public Protection. If the applicant is enrolled in a public or private elementary or secondary school, including a technical education and career school, or an institution of higher education, as defined in section 10a-55 , the clerk of the court shall, upon the request of the applicant, send, by facsimile or other means, a copy of such ex parte order or of any order after notice and hearing, or the information contained in any such order, to such school or institution of higher education, the president of any institution of higher education at which the applicant is enrolled and the special police force established pursuant to section 10a-142 , if any, at the institution of higher education at which the applicant is enrolled, if the applicant provides the clerk with the name and address of such school or institution of higher education.\n\n(e) If the court issues an ex parte order pursuant to subsection (b) of this section and service has not been made on the respondent in conformance with subsection (d) of this section, upon request of the applicant, the court shall, based on the information contained in the original application, extend any ex parte order for an additional period not to exceed fourteen days from the originally scheduled hearing date. The clerk of the court shall prepare a new order of hearing and notice containing the new hearing date, which shall be served upon the respondent in accordance with the provisions of subsection (d) of this section.\n\n(f) An action under this section shall not preclude the applicant from subsequently seeking any other civil or criminal relief based on the same facts and circumstances."

In cases where the officer has determined that no cause exists for an arrest, assistance shall include: (A) Assistance as provided in subdivisions (1) to (6), inclusive, of this subsection; and (B) remaining at the scene for a reasonable time until, in the reasonable judgment of the officer, the likelihood of further imminent violence has been eliminated. For the purposes of this subsection, “trauma-informed care” means services (i) directed by a thorough understanding of the neurological, biological, psychological and social effects of trauma and violence on a person; and (ii) delivered by a regional family violence organization that employs, or provides referrals to, counselors who: (I) Make available to the victim of family violence resources on trauma exposure, its impact and treatment; (II) engage in efforts to strengthen the resilience and protective factors of victims of family violence who are impacted by and vulnerable to trauma; (III) emphasize continuity of care and collaboration among organizations that provide services to children; and (IV) maintain professional relationships for referral and consultation purposes with programs and persons with expertise in trauma-informed care.",

The decision to arrest and charge shall not (1) be dependent on the specific consent of the victim, (2) consider the relationship between persons suspected of committing a family violence crime, or (3) be based solely on a request by the victim. Whenever a peace officer determines that a family violence crime has been committed, such officer may seize any firearm or electronic defense weapon, as defined in section 53a-3 , or ammunition at the location where the crime is alleged to have been committed that is in the possession of any person arrested for the commission of such crime or suspected of its commission or that is in plain view. Not later than seven days after any such seizure, the law enforcement agency shall return such firearm, electronic defense weapon or ammunition in its original condition to the rightful owner thereof unless such person is ineligible to possess such firearm, electronic defense weapon or ammunition or unless otherwise ordered by the court.\n\n(b) When complaints of family violence are made by two or more opposing persons, a peace officer is not required to arrest both persons. The peace officer shall evaluate each complaint separately to determine which person is the dominant aggressor. In determining which person is the dominant aggressor, the peace officer shall consider the need to protect victims of domestic violence, whether one person acted in defense of self or a third person, the relative degree of any injury, any threats creating fear of physical injury, and any history of family violence between such persons, if such history can reasonably be obtained by the peace officer. The peace officer shall arrest the person whom the officer believes to be the dominant aggressor.\n\n(c) If a peace officer believes probable cause exists for the arrest of two or more persons, in lieu of arresting or seeking a warrant for the arrest of any person determined not to be the dominant aggressor, such peace officer may submit a report detailing the conduct of such person during the incident to the state's attorney for the judicial district in which the incident took place for further review and advice. The provisions of this section shall be construed to discourage, when appropriate, but not prohibit, dual arrests.\n\n(d) No peace officer investigating an incident of family violence shall threaten, suggest or otherwise indicate, the arrest of all persons involved in such incident for the purpose of discouraging any request from a person for law enforcement intervention.\n\n(e) No peace officer shall be held liable in any civil action regarding personal injury or injury to property brought by any party to a family violence incident for (1) an arrest based on probable cause; (2) any conditions of release imposed pursuant to subsection (b) of section 54-63c ; or (3) determinations made pursuant to subsection (b) or (c) of this section.\n\n(f) It shall be the responsibility of the peace officer at the scene of a family violence incident to provide immediate assistance to the victim. Such assistance shall include, but need not be limited to: (1) Assisting the victim to obtain medical treatment if such treatment is required; (2) notifying the victim of the right to file an affidavit for a warrant for arrest; (3) informing the victim of services available, including providing the victim with (A) contact information for a regional family violence organization that employs, or provides referrals to, counselors who are trained in providing trauma-informed care, and (B) on and after January 1, 2023, a copy of the information concerning services and resources available to victims of domestic violence published pursuant to section 10-10g ; (4) on and after January 1, 2023, if there is a child at the scene, providing the victim a copy of the documents concerning behavioral and mental health evaluation and treatment resources available to children developed pursuant to section 17a-22r for the mental health region in which such victim is located; (5) referring the victim to the Office of Victim Services; and (6) providing assistance in accordance with the uniform protocols for treating victims of family violence whose immigration status is questionable, established pursuant to subsection (i) of this section. In cases where the officer has determined that no cause exists for an arrest, assistance shall include: (A) Assistance as provided in subdivisions (1) to (6), inclusive, of this subsection; and (B) remaining at the scene for a reasonable time until, in the reasonable judgment of the officer, the likelihood of further imminent violence has been eliminated. For the purposes of this subsection, “trauma-informed care” means services (i) directed by a thorough understanding of the neurological, biological, psychological and social effects of trauma and violence on a person; and (ii) delivered by a regional family violence organization that employs, or provides referrals to, counselors who: (I) Make available to the victim of family violence resources on trauma exposure, its impact and treatment; (II) engage in efforts to strengthen the resilience and protective factors of victims of family violence who are impacted by and vulnerable to trauma; (III) emphasize continuity of care and collaboration among organizations that provide services to children; and (IV) maintain professional relationships for referral and consultation purposes with programs and persons with expertise in trauma-informed care.\n\n(g) (1) Each law enforcement agency shall develop, in conjunction with the Division of Criminal Justice, and implement specific operational guidelines for arrest policies in family violence incidents.

The units shall be coordinated and governed by formal agreement between the Chief State's Attorney and the Judicial Department.\n\n(b) The Court Support Services Division, in accordance with the agreement between the Chief State's Attorney and the Judicial Department, shall establish within each geographical area of the Superior Court a local family violence intervention unit to implement sections 46b-1 , 46b-15 , 46b-38a to 46b-38f , inclusive, and 54-1g . The Court Support Services Division shall oversee direct operations of the local units.\n\n(c) Each such local family violence intervention unit shall: (1) Accept referrals of family violence cases from a judge or prosecutor, (2) prepare written or oral reports on each case for the court by the next court date to be presented at any time during the court session on that date, (3) provide or arrange for services to victims and offenders, (4) administer contracts to carry out such services, and (5) establish centralized reporting procedures. All information provided to a family relations counselor, family relations counselor trainee or family services supervisor employed by the Judicial Department in a local family violence intervention unit shall be used solely for the purposes of preparation of the report and the protective order forms for each case and recommendation of services and shall otherwise be confidential and retained in the files of such unit and not be subject to subpoena or other court process for use in any other proceeding or for any other purpose, except that a family relations counselor, family relations counselor trainee or family services supervisor employed by the Judicial Department:\n\n(A) Shall disclose to the court and the prosecuting authority for appropriate action information that the victim has indicated that the defendant holds a permit to carry a pistol or revolver, possesses one or more firearms or possesses ammunition;\n\n(B) Shall disclose to an employee of the Department of Children and Families information that indicates that a defendant poses a danger or threat to a child or a custodial parent of the child;\n\n(C) May disclose to another family relations counselor, family relations counselor trainee or family services supervisor information pursuant to guidelines adopted by the Chief Court Administrator;\n\n(D) May disclose to a bail commissioner or an intake, assessment and referral specialist employed by the Judicial Department information regarding a defendant who is on or is being considered for pretrial release;\n\n(E) May disclose to a law enforcement agency information that indicates that a defendant poses a danger or threat to another person;\n\n(F) May disclose, after disposition of a family violence case, to a probation officer or a juvenile probation officer, for purposes of determining service needs and supervision levels, information regarding a defendant who has been convicted and sentenced to a period of probation in the family violence case;\n\n(G) May disclose, after a conviction in a family violence case, to a probation officer for the purpose of preparing a presentence investigation report, any information regarding the defendant that has been provided to the family relations counselor, family relations counselor trainee or family services supervisor in the case or in any other case that resulted in the conviction of the defendant;\n\n(H) May disclose to any organization under contract with the Judicial Department to provide family violence programs and services, for the purpose of determining program and service needs, information regarding any defendant who is a client of such organization, provided no information that personally identifies the victim may be disclosed to such organization; and\n\n(I) Shall disclose such information as may be necessary to fulfill such counselor's, trainee's or supervisor's duty as a mandated reporter under section 17a-101a to report suspected child abuse or neglect.\n\n(d) In all cases of family violence, a written or oral report that indicates whether the parties in the family violence case are parties to a case pending on the family relations docket of the Superior Court and includes recommendation of the local family violence intervention unit shall be available to a judge at the first court date appearance to be presented at any time during the court session on that date. A judge of the Superior Court may consider and impose the following conditions to protect the parties, including, but not limited to: (1) Issuance of a protective order pursuant to subsection (e) of this section; (2) prohibition against subjecting the victim to further violence; (3) referral to a family violence education program for persons who commit acts of family violence; and (4) immediate referral for more extensive case assessment. Such protective order shall be an order of the court, and the clerk of the court shall cause (A) a copy of such order to be sent to the victim, and (B) a copy of such order, or the information contained in such order, to be sent by facsimile or other means within forty-eight hours of its issuance to the law enforcement agency for the town in which the victim resides and, if the defendant resides in a town different from the town in which the victim resides, to the law enforcement agency for the town in which the defendant resides. If the victim is employed in a town different from the town in which the victim resides, the clerk of the court shall, upon the request of the victim, send, by facsimile or other means, a copy of such order, or the information contained in such order, to the law enforcement agency for the town in which the victim is employed not later than forty-eight hours after the issuance of such order. If the victim is enrolled in a public or private elementary or secondary school, including a technical education and career school, or an institution of higher education, as defined in section 10a-55 , the clerk of the court shall, upon the request of the victim, send, by facsimile or other means, a copy of such order, or the information contained in such order, to such school or institution of higher education, the president of any institution of higher education at which the victim is enrolled and the special police force established pursuant to section 10a-156b , if any, at the institution of higher education at which the victim is enrolled, if the victim provides the clerk with the name and address of such school or institution of higher education.\n\n(e) (1) A protective order issued under this section may include provisions necessary to protect the victim from threats, harassment, injury or intimidation by the defendant, including, but not limited to, an order enjoining the defendant from (A) imposing any restraint upon the person or liberty of the victim, (B) threatening, harassing, assaulting, molesting or sexually assaulting the victim, or (C) entering the family dwelling or the dwelling of the victim. A protective order issued under this section may include provisions necessary to protect any animal owned or kept by the victim including, but not limited to, an order enjoining the defendant from injuring or threatening to injure such animal. Such order shall be made a condition of the bail or release of the defendant and shall contain the following notification: “In accordance with section 53a-223 of the Connecticut general statutes, any violation of this order constitutes criminal violation of a protective order which is punishable by a term of imprisonment of not more than ten years, a fine of not more than ten thousand dollars, or both. Additionally, in accordance with section 53a-107 of the Connecticut general statutes, entering or remaining in a building or any other premises in violation of this order constitutes criminal trespass in the first degree which is punishable by a term of imprisonment of not more than one year, a fine of not more than two thousand dollars, or both. Violation of this order also violates a condition of your bail or release, and may result in raising the amount of bail or revoking release.” Every order of the court made in accordance with this section after notice and hearing shall be accompanied by a notification that is consistent with the full faith and credit provisions set forth in 18 USC 2265(a), as amended from time to time. The information contained in and concerning the issuance of any protective order issued under this section shall be entered in the registry of protective orders pursuant to section 51-5c .\n\n(2) Each person who receives an order of the court in accordance with this subsection shall be given a notice that contains the following language: “If a protective order has been issued on your behalf or on behalf of your child, you may elect to give testimony or appear in a family court proceeding remotely, pursuant to section 46b-15c . Please notify the court in writing at least two days in advance of a proceeding if you choose to give testimony or appear remotely, and your physical presence in the courthouse will not be required in order to participate in the court proceeding.”.\n\n(f) The Judicial Department shall establish a program within each judicial district for the purpose of using electronic monitoring in accordance with this subsection. Under the program, the court may order that any person appearing in such judicial district who is charged with the violation of a restraining order or a protective order, and who has been determined to be a high-risk offender by the family violence intervention unit, be subject to electronic monitoring designed to warn law enforcement agencies, a state-wide information collection center and the victim when the person is within a specified distance of the victim, if the court finds that such electronic monitoring is necessary to protect the victim. If the court orders that such person be subject to electronic monitoring, the clerk of the court shall send, by facsimile or other means, a copy of the order, or the information contained in any such order, to the law enforcement agency or agencies for the town in which the person resides. The Judicial Branch shall establish the program within each judicial district not later than October 1, 2025.\n\n(g) (1) In cases referred to the local family violence intervention unit, it shall be the function of the unit to (A) identify victim service needs, (B) assess offenders for the purpose of identifying appropriate services, (C) monitor compliance with program requirements by offenders who are allowed to participate in the pretrial family violence education program described in subsection (h) of this section, and (D) monitor offenders who have been referred to pretrial services or programs.\n\n(2) The Judicial Department may contract with victim service providers to make available, either directly or through referral, appropriate services that include, but are not limited to, the provision of trauma-informed care, as defined in subsection (f) of section 46b-38b .\n\n(3) The Judicial Department may contract with service providers to provide domestic violence offender treatment programs for offenders referred by the court. Such treatment programs shall comply with the domestic violence offender program standards promulgated under section 46b-38 l . The provisions of this subdivision shall not apply to the pretrial family violence education program described in subsection (h) of this section.\n\n(h) (1) There shall be a pretrial family violence education program for persons who are charged with family violence crimes. At a minimum, such program shall inform participants of the basic elements of family violence law and applicable penalties. The court may, in its discretion, invoke such program on motion of the defendant when it finds: (A) That the defendant has not previously been convicted of a family violence crime which occurred on or after October 1, 1986; (B) the defendant has not had a previous case assigned to the family violence education program; (C) the defendant has not previously invoked or accepted accelerated rehabilitation under section 54-56e for a family violence crime which occurred on or after October 1, 1986; and (D) that the defendant is not charged with (i) a class A or class B felony, (ii) a class C felony, except in the case of a person charged with a violation of subdivision (1) of subsection (a) of section 53-21 and good cause is shown, (iii) an unclassified felony carrying a term of imprisonment of more than ten years, or (iv) unless good cause is shown, (I) a class D felony, (II) an unclassified offense carrying a term of imprisonment of more than five years, or (III) an offense that involved the infliction of serious physical injury, as defined in section 53a-3 . Participation by any person in the accelerated pretrial rehabilitation program under section 54-56e prior to October 1, 1986, shall not prohibit eligibility of such person for the pretrial family violence education program under this section. The court may require that the defendant answer such questions under oath, in open court or before any person designated by the clerk and duly authorized to administer oaths, under the penalties of perjury as will assist the court in making these findings.\n\n(2) The court, on such motion, may refer the defendant to the family violence intervention unit, and may continue the defendant's case pending the submission of the report of the unit to the court. The court shall also give notice to the victim or victims that the defendant has requested assignment to the family violence education program, and, where possible, give the victim or victims opportunity to be heard. Any defendant who accepts placement in the family violence education program shall agree to the tolling of any statute of limitations with respect to the crime or crimes with which the defendant is charged, and to a waiver of the defendant's right to a speedy trial. Any such defendant shall appear in court and shall be released to the custody of the family violence intervention unit for such period, not exceeding two years, and under such conditions as the court shall order. If the defendant refuses to accept, or, having accepted, violates such conditions, the defendant's case shall be brought to trial. If the defendant satisfactorily completes the family violence education program and complies with the conditions imposed for the period set by the court, the defendant may apply for dismissal of the charges against the defendant and the court, on finding satisfactory compliance, shall dismiss such charges.\n\n(3) Upon dismissal of charges under this subsection, all records of such charges shall be erased pursuant to section 54-142a .\n\n(i) A nonrefundable application fee of one hundred dollars shall be paid to the court by any person who files a motion pursuant to subdivision (1) of subsection (h) of this section to participate in the pretrial family violence education program, and a fee of three hundred dollars shall be paid to the court by any person who enters the family violence education program, except that no person shall be excluded from such program for inability to pay any such fee, provided (1) the person files with the court an affidavit of indigency or inability to pay and the court enters a finding thereof, or (2) such person has been determined indigent and eligible for representation by a public defender who has been appointed on behalf of such person pursuant to section 51-296 . The court shall not require a person to perform community service in lieu of payment of such fee, if such fee is waived. All such fees shall be credited to the General Fund.\n\n(j) The Judicial Department shall establish an ongoing training program for judges, Court Support Services Division personnel, guardians ad litem and clerks to inform them about the policies and procedures of sections 46b-1 , 46b-15 , 46b-38a to 46b-38f , inclusive, and 54-1g , including, but not limited to, the function of the family violence intervention units and the use of restraining and protective orders. Such training program shall include an examination of the factors that contribute to a family being at risk for episodes of domestic violence within the family. The Judicial Branch may consult with organizations that advocate on behalf of victims of domestic violence in order to ensure that the training includes information on the unique characteristics of family violence crimes."

The court may award joint legal custody without awarding joint physical custody where the parents have agreed to merely joint legal custody.\n\n(b) There shall be a presumption, affecting the burden of proof, that joint custody is in the best interests of a minor child where the parents have agreed to an award of joint custody or so agree in open court at a hearing for the purpose of determining the custody of the minor child or children of the marriage. If the court declines to enter an order awarding joint custody pursuant to this subsection, the court shall state in its decision the reasons for denial of an award of joint custody.\n\n(c) If only one parent seeks an order of joint custody upon a motion duly made, the court may order both parties to submit to conciliation at their own expense with the costs of such conciliation to be borne by the parties as the court directs according to each party's ability to pay.\n\n(d) In any proceeding before the Superior Court involving a dispute between the parents of a minor child with respect to the custody, care, education and upbringing of such child, the parents shall file with the court, at such time and in such form as provided by rule of court, a proposed parental responsibility plan that shall include, at a minimum, the following: (1) A schedule of the physical residence of the child during the year; (2) provisions allocating decision-making authority to one or both parents regarding the child's health, education and religious upbringing; (3) provisions for the resolution of future disputes between the parents, including, where appropriate, the involvement of a mental health professional or other parties to assist the parents in reaching a developmentally appropriate resolution to such disputes; (4) provisions for dealing with the parents' failure to honor their responsibilities under the plan; (5) provisions for dealing with the child's changing needs as the child grows and matures; and (6) provisions for minimizing the child's exposure to harmful parental conflict, encouraging the parents in appropriate circumstances to meet their responsibilities through agreements, and protecting the best interests of the child.\n\n(e) The objectives of a parental responsibility plan under this section are to provide for the child's physical care and emotional stability, to provide for the child's changing needs as the child grows and to set forth the authority and responsibility of each parent with respect to the child.\n\n(f) If both parents consent to a parental responsibility plan under this section, such plan shall be approved by the court as the custodial and access orders of the court pursuant to section 46b-56 , unless the court finds that such plan as submitted and agreed to is not in the best interests of the child.\n\n(g) The court may modify any orders made under this section in accordance with section 46b-56 ."

If no educational support order is entered at the time of entry of a decree of dissolution, legal separation or annulment, and the parents have a child who has not attained twenty-three years of age, the court shall inform the parents that no educational support order may be entered thereafter. The court may accept a parent's waiver of the right to file a motion or petition for an educational support order upon a finding that the parent fully understands the consequences of such waiver.",

Trial court lacked jurisdiction to decide issue of visitation; provisions of section as they related to provisions of Secs. 46b-56 and 46b-57 discussed. 239 C. 336. Implicit in statute is rebuttable presumption that visitation that is opposed by a fit parent is not in child's best interest; for a court to have jurisdiction over petition for visitation contrary to wishes of a parent and to grant such petition, petition must contain specific, good faith allegations that petitioner has a relationship with the child that is similar in nature to a parent-child relationship and specific, good faith allegations that denial of visitation will cause real and significant harm to the child, analogous to the kind of harm contemplated by Secs. 46b-120 and 46b-129, that child is neglected, uncared-for or dependent, and petitioner must prove allegations by clear and convincing evidence; statute is unconstitutional as applied to facts in this case. 259 C. 202. Trial court did not have jurisdiction over petition for visitation pursuant to statute that is contrary to the wishes of a fit parent in the absence of allegations and proof that plaintiff had a parent-like relationship with the child and that the child would suffer real and significant harm if deprived of visitation with plaintiff. Id., 240. 259 C. 202 applies retrospectively. 272 C. 500. Where unrelated plaintiff had parent-like relationship with child sufficient for visitation rights, court improperly refused to grant visitation due to concern that defendant would cause child damage in retaliation, and court should have invoked its authority to compel defendant's compliance with visitation order; “best interest of the child” standard cannot overcome the standard in 259 C. 202 for ordering visitation. 300 C. 59. Nothing in section requires trial court to include, as a term and condition governing the order of third-party visitation, a provision affirmatively directing the third party not to override a fit parent's decisions regarding the child's care. 332 C. 115."

Id., 622; 183 C. 35; 184 C. 36. A definitive award of counsel fees should not ordinarily be made until after a trial where evidence relating to the criteria set forth in Sec. 46b-82 has been presented. Id., 513.

In awarding counsel fees, the focus of the inquiry is not on the payor-spouse but rather on the total financial resources of the parties in light of the statutory criteria. Id., 173. Cited. Id., 269; Id., 491; 191 C. 46; Id., 81; 193 C. 261; 194 C. 25; Id., 312; 207 C. 48; 210 C. 462; 211 C. 485; Id., 648; 218 C. 801; 222 C. 32; 225 C. 185. Trial court had authority under section to award attorney's fees to plaintiff without first finding defendant in contempt; judgment of Appellate Court in 41 CA 861 reversed. 241 C. 490. Present case distinguishable from 222 C. 32 because here record supports finding that plaintiff either lacked liquid assets to pay attorney fees or such fees would undermine effect of the other financial orders. 245 C. 508. Section does not authorize an award of attorney's fees against grandparents or other third parties petitioning for visitation under Sec. 46b-59. 294 C. 484. Section only allows for the payment of fees for the attorney for the minor child; the fact that section only includes language allowing for the payment of fees for the attorney for the minor child indicates that the legislature did not intend to allow payment for counsel hired by the attorney for the minor children. 312 C. 600."

Court can award attorney's fees for appeal of case it dismissed for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. 48 CA 645. Trial court properly found that defendant was liable for plaintiff's attorney's fees but improperly awarded a dollar amount for such fees without an appropriate evidentiary showing to determine the reasonableness of such award. 54 CA 634. Trial court's discretion should be guided so that its decision regarding attorney's fees does not undermine its purpose in making any other financial award. 57 CA 165. Trial court did not abuse its discretion in ordering plaintiff to pay $4,000 in counsel fees to defendant to defend the appeal. 69 CA 146. Reiterated previous holdings that specific finding concerning award of attorney's fees not required if record would support a finding that the party to whom attorney's fees are charged does not have sufficient liquid assets to pay such fees or that failure to award such fees would undermine other financial orders of the court. 79 CA 783. Trial court abused its discretion in awarding plaintiff counsel fees of $100,000 because court could not reasonably have concluded that plaintiff was financially unable able to pay her counsel fees or that the failure to award such fees would undermine court's other financial orders. 82 CA 41. Trial court did not abuse its discretion when it determined plaintiff lacked funds to defend appeal and ordered defendant to pay a set fee to plaintiff's attorney. 83 CA 478. Trial court judgment awarding attorney's fees award must be reversed because court's basis for award was improper. 102 CA 1. Trial court improperly decided issue regarding who drafted agreement and therefore award of counsel fees was improper. Id., 96. Although the order for payment of guardian ad litem fees requires consideration of the financial resources of both parties and the criteria set forth in Sec. 46b-82, postdissolution fault is not a factor included among those enumerated in said section, and there is no requirement that the court consider any additional factors or evidence deemed relevant by any of the parties. 107 CA 488. Court did not abuse its discretion when it considered party's litigation misconduct to form part of the basis of an award of attorney's fees for an appeal. 110 CA 798. Court did not abuse its discretion in ordering plaintiff to pay fees and counsel for guardian ad litem because section makes clear the court has power to order payment of reasonable fees regardless of whether there is a written contract or retainer agreement. 117 CA 304. Trial court not authorized to choose from which of defendant's assets fees shall be paid. 159 CA 167. Trial court did not abuse its discretion in awarding attorney's fees to the defendant because the consideration of ample liquid assets pertains to the party requesting fees, not to the party opposing the award. 168 CA 141."

Notwithstanding the provisions of this section, (A) no judgment upon default of appearance of a defendant who has been served by personal or abode service shall be entered pursuant to subsection (b) of this section until at least thirty days after the return date; (B) no judgment upon default of appearance of a defendant who has been served in any other manner shall be entered until after a hearing held at least sixty days after the return date; and (C) no trial of a contested action for dissolution of marriage or legal separation shall commence until at least ninety days after the return date.\n\n(b) (1) If the defendant has not appeared, the plaintiff may file a motion for the entry of judgment upon default of appearance, no sooner than thirty days after the day on which the complaint for dissolution of marriage or civil union or for legal separation is made returnable.

At such hearing, the court, in its discretion, may enter a decree of dissolution of marriage or civil union or of legal separation at such hearing, provided all other applicable requirements of this chapter are met.\n\n(3) If the court finds that (A) the plaintiff has properly effectuated service upon the defendant, either personally or by abode, and, if by abode, has attested (i) that the address at which the defendant was served is the usual place of abode of the defendant, (ii) that the defendant was not known by the plaintiff to be residing, whether permanently or temporarily, at any other address at the time service was made, and (iii) to the most recent date on which the plaintiff had personal knowledge that the defendant resided at the address at which service was made; (B) there were no children born to or adopted by the parties prior to, or during, the marriage or civil union, and that neither party is pregnant; (C) there does not exist a restraining order, issued pursuant to section 46b-15 , or a protective order, issued pursuant to section 46b-38c , between the parties that is in effect; (D) the plaintiff is not requesting alimony or spousal support; and (E) the parties do not have any jointly owned property or jointly held debt, and the plaintiff has filed with the clerk of the court a completed financial affidavit, the court may, in its discretion, grant the motion to waive the time periods set forth in subsection (a) of this section without a hearing. The court may further enter a decree of dissolution of marriage or civil union or of legal separation without a hearing, provided the court shall not enter any order other than a dissolution of marriage or civil union or a legal separation, and, if the plaintiff requests, an order restoring his or her birth name or former name, without a hearing. If the court determines that any of the conditions of this subdivision have not been met, the matter shall be docketed for a hearing pursuant to subdivision (2) of this subsection.\n\n(c) A decree of annulment or dissolution shall give the parties the status of unmarried persons and they may marry again. A decree of legal separation shall have the effect of a decree dissolving the marriage except that neither party shall be free to marry. The six-month period referred to in section 46b-53 shall not apply in actions for annulment and the court may proceed on any cause of action for annulment in the manner generally applicable in civil actions."

Trial court did not abuse its discretion by including in the marital property estate the entire amount received by defendant in an employment case. 265 C. 669.

Parties to a dissolution of marriage proceeding must disclose all potentially distributable retirement or employment benefits and may not decide for themselves whether such benefits constitute property subject to disclosure; when reviewing a dissolution of marriage judgment that pre-dates 258 C. 733, courts must consider what impact, if any, the knowledge of unvested pension benefits would have had on the outcome of the proceeding. 312 C. 428. Section and rules of practice provide significant remedies when a party to a dissolution action has been found to dissipate assets, and Connecticut does not recognize a separate cause of action against a party to a dissolution action for failing to take affirmative steps to recover marital assets from a third party. 317 C. 223."

Assignment of property may only be made at the time of the marital dissolution and is not thereafter subject to modification as are periodic orders. 77 CA 9. Statute authorizes court to issue orders respecting marital property only at the time of dissolution; it does not authorize postjudgment orders for the division of marital property. 79 CA 812. Financial orders cannot be logically inconsistent with factual findings. 82 CA 378. Court did not abuse discretion by awarding plaintiff a portion of stock that vested in defendant after the date of separation. 83 CA 53. Trial court's order requiring sale of marital home and barring parties from purchasing the home was equitable and did not exceed court's statutory authority under section. 84 CA 495. Trial court's order allowing defendant up to fifteen years to pay plaintiff for his share of the marital residence was not abuse of discretion or violation of statutory considerations. 92 CA 678. Trial court properly determined plaintiff did not own the inventory in his antiques business. 102 CA 74. Court did not improperly rely on section in dividing the net partition proceeds. 108 CA 184. Nothing in section prohibits court from mending its erroneous personal property orders. 119 CA 120. Although the court has leeway in determining value of assets in a marital dissolution, a market value approach to valuation, nevertheless, necessarily requires an examination of marketability of the asset being appraised. 121 CA 659. It was within the court's authority to order defendant to repay loans and promissory notes made to plaintiff during course of their marriage and to award interest on any wrongfully withheld moneys. 123 CA 146. Court's second order altered the original property distribution from an award of the qualified domestic relations order to an award of a fixed sum to be paid out of the funds in the qualified domestic relations order as well as the sale of assets and constituted an improper postjudgment modification that exceeded court's powers under section. 125 CA 441. Nothing in section forbids a court from awarding periodic alimony to one spouse when the court has made an equitable distribution of the other spouse's closely held business. 129 CA 171. Court order requiring defendant to release plaintiff and hold him harmless from pending civil action was not error because the pending civil action was “property” subject to distribution under section and section does not require transfer of title or ownership of property in all cases. 148 CA 837. Plaintiff's interest in a limited liability company, i.e., an enforceable right to $520,000 credit for plaintiff's transfer of land to the LLC, was properly characterized as distributable property for purposes of section. 160 CA 708. Based on plain language, there is no presumption that marital property should be divided equally prior to applying the statutory criteria; the specified criteria are not exhaustive, and court properly may consider other equitable factors when crafting property distribution and alimony orders. 167 CA 138. Vested pension benefits in pay status at time of dissolution constitute property for the purposes of equitable distribution. 180 CA 64. The wilful dissipation of assets by defendant did not constitute exceptional intervening circumstances for not entering an order distributing the value of a marital asset as of the date of the original judgment of dissolution. 189 CA 353. Potential future unvested stream of income is a mere expectancy, and too speculative to be categorized as property for purposes of equitable distribution. 217 CA 530."

Plaintiff cannot succeed in claim that he is entitled to immediate appellate review of denial of his motion to dismiss on the proposition that section deprives any trial court of subject matter jurisdiction over a request for postjudgment alimony absent finding of a substantial change in circumstances where plaintiff's argument of lack of statutory jurisdiction does not support claim of lack of subject matter jurisdiction and appeal does not pass the State v.

Court not required to reference expressly the statutory criteria it considered in awarding alimony. Id., 472. Capital gains generated by an asset distributed in dissolution decree do not fall within purview of section; if an asset is property acquired by plaintiff after the dissolution, and, therefore, not distributed as part of the property assignment, then it is income that must be considered by court in an alimony modification; capital gains tax realized on sale of asset acquired after dissolution may be considered by court in determining whether there has been a substantial change in circumstances; appreciation of an asset that was distributed at time of dissolution does not constitute a change in circumstances that court may consider when deciding whether to entertain a motion for modification of alimony. 70 CA 772. In considering “amount and sources of income”, court cannot ignore fact that defendant receives a substantial year-end bonus simply because it is not received until the following year; provision does not require court to structure payment of alimony and child support to accommodate payor's compensation schedule. 71 CA 614.

Trial court properly considered defendant's cohabitation in relation to her financial situation in analyzing statutory factors and determining whether modification of alimony was warranted. 88 CA 674. Defendant's argument that court ignored several factors is unavailing since court is not required to make explicit reference to the statutory criteria that it considered in making its decision or to make express findings as to each statutory factor. 107 CA 488. Court abused its discretion by failing to award time limited or rehabilitative alimony to plaintiff who was found to be responsible for certain debts but could be in dire financial straits due to her inability to increase her earning capacity, receive alimony or receive a portion of the marital property. 125 CA 265. Real property may serve as security for the court's alimony award under section despite language in the prenuptial agreement prohibiting the transfer of interest in premarital net worth that includes such real property. 136 CA 773.

Upon the filing of a motion requesting an initial order of alimony or support pendente lite that is accompanied by an affidavit, on a form prescribed by the Chief Court Administrator, by the moving party attesting that (1) the moving party has insufficient funds to meet the moving party's reasonable needs or the reasonable needs of the minor children of the parties, (2) the other party is not providing sufficient funds to the moving party to meet such reasonable needs, and (3) the moving party reasonably believes that the other party has sufficient means or earning capacity to so provide, then such hearing shall be held by the court not later than sixty days after the date on which such motion requesting an initial order of alimony or support pendente lite and accompanying affidavit were filed. In the event that such hearing requires a continuance to another date, the court shall give calendar priority to scheduling such hearing on a date that facilitates the expeditious resumption and conclusion of the hearing, absent a written agreement or interim orders that provide for such alimony or support pendente lite. In the event of a delay necessitated by a court closure or emergency experienced by a party, such hearing shall be rescheduled to a date that is not later than fourteen days after the date of the originally scheduled hearing date. Full credit shall be given for all sums paid to one party by the other from the date of the filing of such a motion to the date of rendition of such order. In making an order for alimony pendente lite, the court shall consider all factors enumerated in section 46b-82 , except the grounds for the complaint or cross complaint, to be considered with respect to a permanent award of alimony. In making an order for support pendente lite, the court shall consider all factors enumerated in section 46b-84 . The court may also award exclusive use of the family home or any other dwelling unit which is available for use as a residence pendente lite to either of the parties as is just and equitable without regard to the respective interests of the parties in the property. Any financial order affecting the parties entered pursuant to the provisions of section 46b-15 , shall not be considered an initial order of alimony or support pendente lite for purposes of scheduling a hearing under this subsection.\n\n(b) In any proceeding brought under section 46b-45 , 46b-56 or 46b-61 involving a minor child, if one of the parents residing in the family home leaves such home voluntarily and not subject to court order, and if the court finds that the voluntary leaving of the family home by such parent served the best interests of the child, the court may consider such voluntary leaving as a factor when making or modifying any order pursuant to section 46b-56 .\n\nSee Sec. 17b-743 re direction that payments under support order be made to Commissioner of Administrative Services or local welfare department."

              "(d) In determining whether a child is in need of maintenance and, if in need, the respective abilities of the parents to provide such maintenance and the amount thereof, the court shall consider the age, health, station, occupation, earning capacity, amount and sources of income, estate, vocational skills and employability of each of the parents, and the age, health, station, occupation, educational status and expectation, amount and sources of income, vocational skills, employability, estate and needs of the child.",
              "(e) At any time at which orders are entered in a proceeding for dissolution of marriage, annulment, legal separation, custody, or support, whether before, at the time of, or after entry of a decree or judgment, if health insurance coverage for a child is ordered by the court to be maintained, the court shall provide in the order that (1) the signature of the custodial parent or custodian of the insured dependent shall constitute a valid authorization to the insurer for purposes of processing an insurance reimbursement payment to the provider of the medical services, to the custodial parent or to the custodian, (2) neither parent shall prevent or interfere with the timely processing of any insurance reimbursement claim and (3) if the parent receiving an insurance reimbursement payment is not the parent or custodian who is paying the bill for the services of the medical provider, the parent receiving such insurance reimbursement payment shall promptly pay to the parent or custodian paying such bill any insurance reimbursement for such services.

Such insurer may thereafter rely on such order and is not responsible for inquiring as to the legal sufficiency of the order. The custodial parent or custodian shall be responsible for providing the insurer with a certified copy of any order which materially alters the provision of the original order with respect to the maintenance of insurance for a child. If presented with an insurance reimbursement claim signed by the custodial parent or custodian, such insurer shall reimburse the provider of the medical services, if payment is to be made to such provider under the policy, or shall otherwise reimburse the custodial parent or custodian.",
              "(f) (1) After the granting of a decree annulling or dissolving the marriage or ordering a legal separation, and upon complaint or motion with order and summons made to the Superior Court by either parent or by the Commissioner of Administrative Services in any case arising under subsection (a) or (b) of this section, the court shall inquire into the child's need of maintenance and the respective abilities of the parents to supply maintenance. The court shall make and enforce the decree for the maintenance of the child as it considers just, and may direct security to be given therefor, including an order to either party to contract with a third party for periodic payments or payments contingent on a life to the other party. The court may order that a party obtain life insurance as such security unless such party proves, by a preponderance of the evidence, that such insurance is not available to such party, such party is unable to pay the cost of such insurance or such party is uninsurable.",
              "(2) The court shall include in each support order a provision for the health care coverage of the child who is subject to the provisions of subsection (a) or (b) of this section. Such provision may include an order for either parent or both parents to provide such coverage under any or all of subparagraphs (A), (B) or (C) of this subdivision.",
              "(A) The provision for health care coverage may include an order for either parent to name any child as a beneficiary of any medical or dental insurance or benefit plan carried by such parent or available to such parent at a reasonable cost, as described in subparagraph (D) of this subdivision. If such order in a IV-D support case requires the parent to maintain insurance available through an employer, the order shall be enforced using a National Medical Support Notice as provided in section 46b-88 .",
              "(B) The provision for health care coverage may include an order for either parent to: (i) Apply for and maintain coverage on behalf of the child under HUSKY B; or (ii) provide cash medical support, as described in subparagraphs (E) and (F) of this subdivision. An order under this subparagraph shall be made only if the cost to the parent obligated to maintain the coverage under HUSKY B or provide cash medical support is reasonable, as described in subparagraph (D) of this subdivision. An order under clause (i) of this subparagraph shall be made only if insurance coverage as described in subparagraph (A) of this subdivision is unavailable at reasonable cost to either parent, or inaccessible to the child.",
              "(C) An order for payment of the child's medical and dental expenses, other than those described in clause (ii) of subparagraph (E) of this subdivision, that are not covered by insurance or reimbursed in any other manner shall be entered in accordance with the child support guidelines established pursuant to section 46b-215a .",
              "(D) Health care coverage shall be deemed reasonable in cost if: (i) The parent obligated to maintain such coverage would qualify as a low-income obligor under the child support guidelines established pursuant to section 46b-215a , based solely on such parent's income, and the cost does not exceed five per cent of such parent's net income; or (ii) the parent obligated to maintain such coverage would not qualify as a low-income obligor under such guidelines and the cost does not exceed seven and one-half per cent of such parent's net income. In either case, net income shall be determined in accordance with the child support guidelines established pursuant to section 46b-215a . If a parent obligated to maintain insurance must obtain coverage for himself or herself to comply with the order to provide coverage for the child, reasonable cost shall be determined based on the combined cost of coverage for such parent and such child.",
              "(E) Cash medical support means: (i) An amount ordered to be paid toward the cost of premiums for health insurance coverage provided by a public entity, including HUSKY A or B, except as provided in subparagraph (F) of this subdivision, or by another parent through employment or otherwise, or (ii) an amount ordered to be paid, either directly to a medical provider or to the person obligated to pay such provider, toward any ongoing extraordinary medical and dental expenses of the child that are not covered by insurance or reimbursed in any other manner, provided such expenses are documented and identified (I) specifically on the record, or (II) in an affidavit, made under oath, that states no restraining order issued pursuant to section 46b-15 or protective order issued pursuant to section 46b-38c , between the parties is in effect or pending before the court. Cash medical support, as described in clauses (i) and (ii) of this subparagraph may be ordered in lieu of an order under subparagraph (A) of this subdivision to be effective until such time as health insurance that is accessible to the child and reasonable in cost becomes available, or in addition to an order under subparagraph (A) of this subdivision, provided the combined cost of insurance and cash medical support is reasonable, as defined in subparagraph (D) of this subdivision. An order for cash medical support shall be payable to the state or the custodial party, as their interests may appear, provided an order under clause (i) of this subparagraph shall be effective only as long as health insurance coverage is maintained. Any unreimbursed medical and dental expenses not covered by an order issued pursuant to clause (ii) of this subparagraph are subject to an order for unreimbursed medical and dental expenses pursuant to subparagraph (C) of this subdivision.",
              "(F) Cash medical support to offset the cost of any insurance payable under HUSKY A or B, shall not be ordered against a noncustodial parent who is a low-income obligor, as defined in the child support guidelines established pursuant to section 46b-215a , or against a custodial parent of children covered under HUSKY A or B.",
              "(g) Whenever an obligor is before the court in proceedings to establish, modify or enforce a support order, and such order is not secured by an income withholding order, the court may require the obligor to execute a bond or post other security sufficient to perform such order for support, provided the court finds that such a bond is available for purchase within the financial means of the obligor. Upon failure of such obligor to comply with such support order, the court may order the bond or the security forfeited and the proceeds thereof distributed as required by Title IV-D of the Social Security Act. In any IV-D case in which the obligor is found by the court to owe past-due support, the court may issue an order for the periodic payment of such support or, if such obligor is not incapacitated, order such obligor to participate in work activities which may include, but shall not be limited to, job search, training, work experience and participation in the job training and retraining program established by the Labor Commissioner pursuant to section 31-3t .",
              "(h) In IV-D support cases, as defined in subdivision (13) of subsection (b) of section 46b-231 , a copy of any support order established or modified pursuant to this section or, in the case of a motion for modification of an existing support order, a notice of determination that there should be no change in the amount of the support order, shall be provided to each party and the state case registry within fourteen days after issuance of such order or determination.",

The provisions of this subsection shall apply only in cases where the decree of dissolution of marriage, legal separation or annulment is entered on or after July 1, 1994.\n\n(c) (1) The court may make appropriate orders of support of any child with intellectual disability, as defined in section 1-1g , or a mental disability, as defined in section 46a-51 , or who is physically disabled, as defined in section 46a-51 , who resides with a parent and is principally dependent upon such parent for maintenance until such child attains the age of twenty-one. The provisions of this subdivision shall apply only in cases where the decree of dissolution of marriage, legal separation or annulment is entered on or after October 1, 1997, and before October 1, 2023, or where the initial support orders in actions not claiming any such decree are entered on or after October 1, 1997, and before October 1, 2023. (2) The court may make appropriate orders of support of any child with intellectual disability, as defined in section 1-1g , or a mental disability, as defined in section 46a-51 , or who is physically disabled, as defined in section 46a-51 , who resides with a parent and is principally dependent upon such parent for maintenance until such child attains the age of twenty-six. The provisions of this subdivision shall apply only in cases where the decree of dissolution of marriage, legal separation or annulment is entered on or after October 1, 2023, or where the initial support orders in actions not claiming any such decree are entered on or after October 1, 2023. (3) The child support guidelines established pursuant to section 46b-215a shall not apply to any order entered under this subsection.\n\n(d) In determining whether a child is in need of maintenance and, if in need, the respective abilities of the parents to provide such maintenance and the amount thereof, the court shall consider the age, health, station, occupation, earning capacity, amount and sources of income, estate, vocational skills and employability of each of the parents, and the age, health, station, occupation, educational status and expectation, amount and sources of income, vocational skills, employability, estate and needs of the child.\n\n(e) At any time at which orders are entered in a proceeding for dissolution of marriage, annulment, legal separation, custody, or support, whether before, at the time of, or after entry of a decree or judgment, if health insurance coverage for a child is ordered by the court to be maintained, the court shall provide in the order that (1) the signature of the custodial parent or custodian of the insured dependent shall constitute a valid authorization to the insurer for purposes of processing an insurance reimbursement payment to the provider of the medical services, to the custodial parent or to the custodian, (2) neither parent shall prevent or interfere with the timely processing of any insurance reimbursement claim and (3) if the parent receiving an insurance reimbursement payment is not the parent or custodian who is paying the bill for the services of the medical provider, the parent receiving such insurance reimbursement payment shall promptly pay to the parent or custodian paying such bill any insurance reimbursement for such services. For purposes of subdivision (1), the custodial parent or custodian is responsible for providing the insurer with a certified copy of the order of dissolution or other order requiring maintenance of insurance for a child provided if such custodial parent or custodian fails to provide the insurer with a copy of such order, the Commissioner of Social Services may provide the insurer with a copy of such order. Such insurer may thereafter rely on such order and is not responsible for inquiring as to the legal sufficiency of the order. The custodial parent or custodian shall be responsible for providing the insurer with a certified copy of any order which materially alters the provision of the original order with respect to the maintenance of insurance for a child. If presented with an insurance reimbursement claim signed by the custodial parent or custodian, such insurer shall reimburse the provider of the medical services, if payment is to be made to such provider under the policy, or shall otherwise reimburse the custodial parent or custodian.\n\n(f) (1) After the granting of a decree annulling or dissolving the marriage or ordering a legal separation, and upon complaint or motion with order and summons made to the Superior Court by either parent or by the Commissioner of Administrative Services in any case arising under subsection (a) or (b) of this section, the court shall inquire into the child's need of maintenance and the respective abilities of the parents to supply maintenance. The court shall make and enforce the decree for the maintenance of the child as it considers just, and may direct security to be given therefor, including an order to either party to contract with a third party for periodic payments or payments contingent on a life to the other party. The court may order that a party obtain life insurance as such security unless such party proves, by a preponderance of the evidence, that such insurance is not available to such party, such party is unable to pay the cost of such insurance or such party is uninsurable.\n\n(2) The court shall include in each support order a provision for the health care coverage of the child who is subject to the provisions of subsection (a) or (b) of this section. Such provision may include an order for either parent or both parents to provide such coverage under any or all of subparagraphs (A), (B) or (C) of this subdivision.\n\n(A) The provision for health care coverage may include an order for either parent to name any child as a beneficiary of any medical or dental insurance or benefit plan carried by such parent or available to such parent at a reasonable cost, as described in subparagraph (D) of this subdivision. If such order in a IV-D support case requires the parent to maintain insurance available through an employer, the order shall be enforced using a National Medical Support Notice as provided in section 46b-88 .\n\n(B) The provision for health care coverage may include an order for either parent to: (i) Apply for and maintain coverage on behalf of the child under HUSKY B; or (ii) provide cash medical support, as described in subparagraphs (E) and (F) of this subdivision. An order under this subparagraph shall be made only if the cost to the parent obligated to maintain the coverage under HUSKY B or provide cash medical support is reasonable, as described in subparagraph (D) of this subdivision. An order under clause (i) of this subparagraph shall be made only if insurance coverage as described in subparagraph (A) of this subdivision is unavailable at reasonable cost to either parent, or inaccessible to the child.\n\n(C) An order for payment of the child's medical and dental expenses, other than those described in clause (ii) of subparagraph (E) of this subdivision, that are not covered by insurance or reimbursed in any other manner shall be entered in accordance with the child support guidelines established pursuant to section 46b-215a .\n\n(D) Health care coverage shall be deemed reasonable in cost if: (i) The parent obligated to maintain such coverage would qualify as a low-income obligor under the child support guidelines established pursuant to section 46b-215a , based solely on such parent's income, and the cost does not exceed five per cent of such parent's net income; or (ii) the parent obligated to maintain such coverage would not qualify as a low-income obligor under such guidelines and the cost does not exceed seven and one-half per cent of such parent's net income. In either case, net income shall be determined in accordance with the child support guidelines established pursuant to section 46b-215a . If a parent obligated to maintain insurance must obtain coverage for himself or herself to comply with the order to provide coverage for the child, reasonable cost shall be determined based on the combined cost of coverage for such parent and such child.\n\n(E) Cash medical support means: (i) An amount ordered to be paid toward the cost of premiums for health insurance coverage provided by a public entity, including HUSKY A or B, except as provided in subparagraph (F) of this subdivision, or by another parent through employment or otherwise, or (ii) an amount ordered to be paid, either directly to a medical provider or to the person obligated to pay such provider, toward any ongoing extraordinary medical and dental expenses of the child that are not covered by insurance or reimbursed in any other manner, provided such expenses are documented and identified (I) specifically on the record, or (II) in an affidavit, made under oath, that states no restraining order issued pursuant to section 46b-15 or protective order issued pursuant to section 46b-38c , between the parties is in effect or pending before the court. Cash medical support, as described in clauses (i) and (ii) of this subparagraph may be ordered in lieu of an order under subparagraph (A) of this subdivision to be effective until such time as health insurance that is accessible to the child and reasonable in cost becomes available, or in addition to an order under subparagraph (A) of this subdivision, provided the combined cost of insurance and cash medical support is reasonable, as defined in subparagraph (D) of this subdivision. An order for cash medical support shall be payable to the state or the custodial party, as their interests may appear, provided an order under clause (i) of this subparagraph shall be effective only as long as health insurance coverage is maintained. Any unreimbursed medical and dental expenses not covered by an order issued pursuant to clause (ii) of this subparagraph are subject to an order for unreimbursed medical and dental expenses pursuant to subparagraph (C) of this subdivision.\n\n(F) Cash medical support to offset the cost of any insurance payable under HUSKY A or B, shall not be ordered against a noncustodial parent who is a low-income obligor, as defined in the child support guidelines established pursuant to section 46b-215a , or against a custodial parent of children covered under HUSKY A or B.\n\n(g) Whenever an obligor is before the court in proceedings to establish, modify or enforce a support order, and such order is not secured by an income withholding order, the court may require the obligor to execute a bond or post other security sufficient to perform such order for support, provided the court finds that such a bond is available for purchase within the financial means of the obligor. Upon failure of such obligor to comply with such support order, the court may order the bond or the security forfeited and the proceeds thereof distributed as required by Title IV-D of the Social Security Act. In any IV-D case in which the obligor is found by the court to owe past-due support, the court may issue an order for the periodic payment of such support or, if such obligor is not incapacitated, order such obligor to participate in work activities which may include, but shall not be limited to, job search, training, work experience and participation in the job training and retraining program established by the Labor Commissioner pursuant to section 31-3t .\n\n(h) In IV-D support cases, as defined in subdivision (13) of subsection (b) of section 46b-231 , a copy of any support order established or modified pursuant to this section or, in the case of a motion for modification of an existing support order, a notice of determination that there should be no change in the amount of the support order, shall be provided to each party and the state case registry within fourteen days after issuance of such order or determination.\n\nSee Sec. 17b-743 re direction that payments under support order be made to Commissioner of Administrative Services or local welfare department.\n\nSee Sec. 17b-744 re discontinuance of support payments to Commissioner of Administrative Services.\n\nSee Sec. 46b-88 re National Medical Support Notice.\n\nSee Sec. 46b-215e re institutionalized or incarcerated child support obligor."

There shall be a rebuttable presumption that any deviation of less than fifteen per cent from the child support guidelines is not substantial and any deviation of fifteen per cent or more from the guidelines is substantial. Modification may be made of such support order without regard to whether the order was issued before, on or after May 9, 1991. In determining whether to modify a child support order based on a substantial deviation from such child support guidelines the court shall consider the division of real and personal property between the parties set forth in the final decree and the benefits accruing to the child as the result of such division. After the date of judgment, modification of any child support order issued before, on or after July 1, 1990, may be made upon a showing of such substantial change of circumstances, whether or not such change of circumstances was contemplated at the time of dissolution. By written agreement, stipulation or decision of the court, those items or circumstances that were contemplated and are not to be changed may be specified in the written agreement, stipulation or decision of the court. This section shall not apply to assignments under section 46b-81 or to any assignment of the estate or a portion thereof of one party to the other party under prior law. No order for periodic payment of permanent alimony or support may be subject to retroactive modification, except that the court may order modification with respect to any period during which there is a pending motion for modification of an alimony or support order from the date of service of notice of such pending motion upon the opposing party pursuant to section 52-50 . If a court finds that a substantial change in circumstances of either party has occurred, the court shall determine what modification of alimony, if any, is appropriate, considering the criteria set forth in section 46b-82 .",

In the event that a final judgment incorporates a provision of an agreement in which the parties agree to circumstances, other than as provided in this subsection, under which alimony will be modified, including suspension, reduction, or termination of alimony, the court shall enforce the provision of such agreement and enter orders in accordance therewith.",

In cases in which primary physical custody is transferred from the party receiving the unallocated alimony and support payments to the party making the payments, a nonmodification provision in the parties' separation agreement does not prevent the modification of the unallocated order in an amount attributable to child support; to the extent that the application of the specific language of Sec. 46b-224 to suspend or modify a support order that purports to preclude modification appears to conflict with the general language of this Subsec., Sec. 46b-224 must prevail. 305 C. 539. When considering a motion for modification under Subsec., court must first determine whether moving party has established a substantial change in circumstances, and, in making such determination, if party's voluntary action gave rise to the alleged substantial change in circumstances warranting modification, court must assess motivations underlying the voluntary conduct in order to determine if there is culpable conduct of the party to preclude a determination of substantial change in circumstances; crux of inquiry is culpability not voluntariness. 310 C. 665.

Trial court has authority to determine, sua sponte, whether an award is alimony or support, or a property settlement; trial court may find that an obligation was intended as property settlement made pursuant to Sec. 46b-81 and therefore nonmodifiable pursuant to this Subsec., despite the fact that a judgment has conditions attached terminating the obligation, or that there is a later stipulation modifying the obligation. 54 CA 142. Retroactive modification of alimony pendente lite orders by the pendente lite court prior to dissolution judgment held not improper. Id., 304. Child support award found not to be modifiable even though it exceeded presumptive amount set by the child support guidelines in case in which defendant's gross earnings did not increase and the parties had agreement that limited modification to a change in circumstances reflecting an increase in gross earnings in excess of a specified amount. 56 CA 459. Alimony may be suspended under statute where there is a distinct separation agreement. 59 CA 628. Statute deprives Superior Court of continuing jurisdiction over that portion of a dissolution judgment providing for assignment of property of one party to the other party under Sec. 46b-81; court improperly applied the law and abused its discretion by modifying child support order without first finding that there was a substantial change in the circumstances of one of the parties. 70 CA 212. “Pending motion” as used in Subsec. means “remaining undecided”. 88 CA 246. Plaintiff failed to demonstrate, as required by the consent to judgment, that defendant was gainfully employed and therefore there was no substantial change in circumstances; trial court was effectively precluded from granting plaintiff any relief. 102 CA 1. Court may increase plaintiff's alimony based on motion to increase alimony under Subsec. despite defendant's motion to reduce or terminate alimony under Subsec. (b). 124 CA 472. Court abused its discretion in failing to find the presumptive amount of child support pursuant to the guidelines and in issuing the combined child support order without justifying a deviation from the guidelines. 132 CA 291. Court abused its discretion by granting plaintiff's motion to modify alimony when plaintiff's employment situation had not changed since the original judgment of dissolution and court could not reasonably find that there was a decrease in plaintiff's earning capacity that constituted a substantial change in plaintiff's financial circumstances. Id., 339. Defendant failed to meet burden of showing a substantial change in circumstances that was not tainted by his culpable conduct of commingling his assets with those of his new spouse and making large gifts to his new spouse and to his children without consideration. 136 CA 210. If a party makes a preliminary showing that an affidavit submitted at the time of dissolution was inaccurate, that the error was not intentional or misleading, and that it would be inequitable to rely only on the mistaken information, a postdissolution court may consider factors other than the financial affidavit to determine if there has been a substantial change of circumstances. 156 CA 739. Court lacked subject matter jurisdiction to enter postdissolution orders modifying property distribution provisions in a judgment of dissolution even when parties submitted a stipulation requiring that the court modify the order. 157 CA 587; judgment reversed, see 322 C. 757. To the extent that Sec. 46b-224 conflicts with general provisions of Subsec. precluding retroactive modification of child support unless service of process requirement in Sec. 52-50 is satisfied, Sec. 46b-224 must prevail; while child support portion of unallocated support award was subject to retroactive modification, court lacked authority to retroactively modify alimony portion of unallocated support award or supplemental bonus alimony award due to defendant's failure to provide plaintiff with proper service of motion to modify in accordance with Sec. 52-50. 161 CA 271. Provisions for the payment of child care costs are part of an order of child support and are subject to the prohibition against retroactive modification under section. 164 CA 665. Subsec. does not require court to make a modification retroactive to the date of service of the motion for modification. 172 CA 767. Subsec. limits court discretion to modify a support order with retroactive effect to the date upon which the motion to modify was served upon the opposing party. 176 CA 658."

When court, in setting alimony award pursuant to Sec. 46b-82, quantifies person's financial needs in terms of dollar amounts at time of dissolution, proper way for court to subsequently determine whether such person's financial needs have changed as a result of cohabitation is to quantify such person's financial needs in terms of dollar amounts during period of cohabitation. 109 CA 316. Subsec. does not require a court to reduce alimony if a party proves that the other party's financial circumstances have changed as a result of his or her choice to live with another person; there is no language in Subsec. to preclude a party who is receiving alimony from pursuing a motion to increase alimony. 124 CA 472. Divorce judgment requiring payment of alimony only until date of cohabitation required court to terminate alimony as of that date despite discretion under section to modify or amend in other cases. 144 CA 319; judgment affirmed, see 316 C. 182.

There shall be a rebuttable presumption that any deviation of less than fifteen per cent from the child support guidelines is not substantial and any deviation of fifteen per cent or more from the guidelines is substantial. Modification may be made of such support order without regard to whether the order was issued before, on or after May 9, 1991. In determining whether to modify a child support order based on a substantial deviation from such child support guidelines the court shall consider the division of real and personal property between the parties set forth in the final decree and the benefits accruing to the child as the result of such division. After the date of judgment, modification of any child support order issued before, on or after July 1, 1990, may be made upon a showing of such substantial change of circumstances, whether or not such change of circumstances was contemplated at the time of dissolution.

This section shall not apply to assignments under section 46b-81 or to any assignment of the estate or a portion thereof of one party to the other party under prior law.

              "(b) (1) Whenever a court or family support magistrate enters a support order in a Title IV-D support case, as defined in subsection (b) of section 46b-231 , that requires a noncustodial parent to provide employment-based health care coverage for a child, and the noncustodial parent's employer is known to the issuing agency, such agency shall enforce the health care coverage provisions of the order through the use of a NMSN. The issuing agency may also use the NMSN to enforce provisions of the support order requiring the custodial parent to provide employment-based health coverage for the child.",
              "(2) In addition to other notice and requirements contained therein, the NMSN shall serve as notice to the employer that: (A) The employee is obligated to provide employment-based health care coverage for the child; (B) the employer may be required to withhold any employee contributions required by the group health plan or plans in which the child is eligible to be enrolled; and (C) the employer is required to forward the NMSN to the administrator of each group health plan providing such coverage for enrollment determination purposes.",
              "(3) In addition to other notice requirements contained therein, the NMSN shall serve as notice to the group health plan that: (A) Receipt of the NMSN from an employer constitutes receipt of a medical support order; and (B) an appropriately completed NMSN constitutes a qualified medical child support order for health care coverage enrollment purposes.",
              "(4) In any case in which the noncustodial parent is a newly hired employee, the NMSN shall be transferred by the issuing agency to the employer no later than two business days after the date of the entry of the employee in the State Directory of New Hires established under section 31-254 , together with any necessary income withholding notice.",
              "(c) (1) An employer who receives a NMSN from the issuing agency shall: (A) No later than twenty business days, after the date of NMSN, either (i) return the notice to such agency indicating why the health care coverage is not available, or (ii) transfer the notice to the administrator of each appropriate group health plan for which the child may be eligible; (B) upon notification from any such group health plan that the child is eligible for enrollment, withhold from the employee's income any employee contribution required under such plan and send the withheld payments directly to the plan, except as provided in subsection (d) of this section; and (C) notify the issuing agency whenever the employee's employment terminates. (2) Any employer who discharges an employee from employment, refuses to employ, or takes disciplinary action against an employee because of a medical child support withholding, or fails to withhold income or transmit withheld income to the group health plan as required by the NMSN shall be subject to the penalties related to employer processing of child support income withholding, as provided in subsections (f) and (j) of section 52-362 .

              "(d) The NMSN shall inform the employer of the duration of the withholding requirement, of any limitations on withholding prescribed by federal or state law, and of any withholding priorities that apply when available income is insufficient to satisfy all cash and medical support obligations. A withholding for medical support obligations shall take priority over all support obligations other than current child and spousal support.

Enrollment of the child may not be denied because the child: (A) Was born out of wedlock, (B) is not claimed as a dependent on the participant's federal income tax return, (C) does not reside with the participant or in the plan's service area, or (D) is receiving benefits or is eligible for benefits under a state medical assistance plan required by the Social Security Act. An enrollment shall be made without regard to open season enrollment restrictions, and if enrollment of a child is dependent on the enrollment of a participant who is not enrolled, both the child and the participant shall be enrolled. (2) No later than forty business days after the date of the NMSN the plan administrator shall notify the issuing agency whether coverage is available or, if necessary, of the steps to be taken to begin such coverage. The administrator shall also provide to the custodial parent a description of the coverage available and of any forms or documents necessary to begin coverage. The issuing agency, in consultation with the custodial parent, shall promptly select from any available plan options when necessary. Upon completion of enrollment, the group health plan administrator shall return the NMSN to the employer for a determination of whether any necessary employee contributions are available.",

In a substantiation of abuse hearing, if it is shown that child has sustained a nonaccidental injury as result of parent administered corporal punishment, hearing officer must determine whether the punishment was reasonable and whether parent believed the punishment was necessary to maintain discipline or to promote child's welfare. 86 CA 290. Although no actual harm was done to child, child was neglected within definition of section because the father was not taking his medication as required to remedy his known mental health condition and neither he nor respondent understood, or attempted to learn, extent of the risk that father may have posed to the child in his unmedicated state. 98 CA 797. An adjudication of neglect relates to the status of the child and is not necessarily premised on parental fault, and a finding that a child is neglected is different from finding who is responsible for child's condition of neglect. 121 CA 292; 123 CA 103. Plaintiff-teacher could not have been on notice that his cheek-pinching and name-calling behavior toward a student amounted to child abuse within the meaning of “abused” as interpreted by Department of Children and Families regulations, and as such, the definition of “abused” was unconstitutionally vague as to plaintiff's conduct and placement of plaintiff's name on child abuse and neglect registry based on such definition was unconstitutional. 134 CA 288; judgment reversed, see 312 C. 393.

If so, the court may authorize the filing of a verified petition of alleged delinquency or it may make without such petition whatever nonjudicial disposition is practicable, including the ordering of such child to do work of which he is capable in public buildings or on public property, particularly in cases in which the complaint alleges that the conduct of such child resulted in the wilful destruction of property, provided the facts establishing jurisdiction are admitted and that a competent acceptance of such a disposition has been given by the child and his parent or guardian. If a nonjudicial disposition is made, the term of any nonjudicial supervision shall be established by the juvenile probation supervisor or designee provided such period of supervision shall not exceed one hundred eighty days. Each verified petition of delinquency filed by the court shall set forth plainly (1) the facts which bring the child within the jurisdiction of the court, (2) the name, date of birth, sex and residence of the child, (3) the names and residence of his parent or parents, guardian or other person having control of the child, and (4) a prayer for appropriate action by the court in conformity with the provisions of this chapter.",
              "(b) Upon the filing of a delinquency petition, the court may, either forthwith or after investigation, cause a summons, which summons shall have a copy of said verified petition attached thereto, signed by the judge or by the clerk or assistant clerk of such court, to be issued, requiring the child and the parent or parents, guardian or other person having control of the child to appear in court at the time and place therein specified. Whenever it appears to the judge that orders addressed to an adult, as set forth in section 46b-121 , are necessary for the welfare of such child, a similar summons shall be issued and served upon such adult if such adult is not already in court. Service of summons, together with a copy of the verified petition, may be made by any one of the following methods: (1) By the delivery of a true and attested copy thereof to the person summoned, or at such person's usual place of abode; (2) by restricted delivery addressed to the person summoned, return receipt requested; or (3) by first class mail addressed to the person summoned. Any notice sent by first class mail shall include a provision informing the party that appearance in court as a result of the notice may subject the appearing party to the jurisdiction of the court. If service is made by first class mail and the party does not appear, no order may be entered by the court in the case. If, after reasonable effort, personal service has not been made, such substitute service, by publication or otherwise, as the judge may order, shall be sufficient. Service may be made by any officer authorized by law to serve process, or by a probation officer, probation aide or indifferent person, and the court may allow suitable expenses and a reasonable fee therefor. The court may punish for contempt, as provided in section 46b-121 , any parent, guardian or other person so summoned who fails to appear in court at the time and place so specified.",

            "text": "(a) Whenever the Superior Court is in receipt of any written complaint filed by any person, any public or private agency or any federal, state, city or town department maintaining that a child's conduct constitutes delinquency within the meaning of section 46b-120 , it shall make a preliminary investigation to determine whether the facts, if true, would be sufficient to be a juvenile matter and whether the interests of the public or the child require that further action be taken. If so, the court may authorize the filing of a verified petition of alleged delinquency or it may make without such petition whatever nonjudicial disposition is practicable, including the ordering of such child to do work of which he is capable in public buildings or on public property, particularly in cases in which the complaint alleges that the conduct of such child resulted in the wilful destruction of property, provided the facts establishing jurisdiction are admitted and that a competent acceptance of such a disposition has been given by the child and his parent or guardian. If a nonjudicial disposition is made, the term of any nonjudicial supervision shall be established by the juvenile probation supervisor or designee provided such period of supervision shall not exceed one hundred eighty days. Each verified petition of delinquency filed by the court shall set forth plainly (1) the facts which bring the child within the jurisdiction of the court, (2) the name, date of birth, sex and residence of the child, (3) the names and residence of his parent or parents, guardian or other person having control of the child, and (4) a prayer for appropriate action by the court in conformity with the provisions of this chapter.\n\n(b) Upon the filing of a delinquency petition, the court may, either forthwith or after investigation, cause a summons, which summons shall have a copy of said verified petition attached thereto, signed by the judge or by the clerk or assistant clerk of such court, to be issued, requiring the child and the parent or parents, guardian or other person having control of the child to appear in court at the time and place therein specified. Whenever it appears to the judge that orders addressed to an adult, as set forth in section 46b-121 , are necessary for the welfare of such child, a similar summons shall be issued and served upon such adult if such adult is not already in court. Service of summons, together with a copy of the verified petition, may be made by any one of the following methods: (1) By the delivery of a true and attested copy thereof to the person summoned, or at such person's usual place of abode; (2) by restricted delivery addressed to the person summoned, return receipt requested; or (3) by first class mail addressed to the person summoned. Any notice sent by first class mail shall include a provision informing the party that appearance in court as a result of the notice may subject the appearing party to the jurisdiction of the court. If service is made by first class mail and the party does not appear, no order may be entered by the court in the case. If, after reasonable effort, personal service has not been made, such substitute service, by publication or otherwise, as the judge may order, shall be sufficient. Service may be made by any officer authorized by law to serve process, or by a probation officer, probation aide or indifferent person, and the court may allow suitable expenses and a reasonable fee therefor. The court may punish for contempt, as provided in section 46b-121 , any parent, guardian or other person so summoned who fails to appear in court at the time and place so specified.\n\nSee Sec. 46b-142 re venue and appeals in juvenile matters."

              "(a) In any juvenile matter, as defined in section 46b-121 , in which a child or youth is alleged to have committed a delinquent act, the child or youth shall not be tried, convicted, adjudicated or subject to any disposition pursuant to section 46b-140 while the child or youth is not competent. For the purposes of this section, a transfer to the regular criminal docket of the Superior Court pursuant to section 46b-127 shall not be considered a disposition. A child or youth is not competent if the child or youth is unable to understand the proceedings against him or her or to assist in his or her own defense.",
              "(b) If, at any time during a proceeding on a juvenile matter, it appears that the child or youth is not competent, counsel for the child or youth, the prosecutorial official, or the court, on its own motion, may request an examination to determine the child's or youth's competency. Whenever a request for a competency examination is under consideration by the court, the child or youth shall be represented by counsel in accordance with the provisions of sections 46b-135 and 46b-136 .",
              "(c) A child or youth alleged to have committed an offense is presumed to be competent. The age of the child or youth is not a per se determinant of incompetency. The burden of going forward with the evidence and proving that the child or youth is not competent by a preponderance of the evidence shall be on the party raising the issue of competency, except that if the court raises the issue of competency, the burden of going forward with the evidence shall be on the state. The court may call its own witnesses and conduct its own inquiry.",
              "(d) If the court finds that the request for a competency examination is justified and that there is probable cause to believe that the child or youth has committed the alleged offense, the court shall order a competency examination of the child or youth. Competency examinations shall be conducted, within available appropriations, by (1) a clinical team constituted under policies and procedures established by the Chief Court Administrator, or (2) if agreed to by all parties, a physician specializing in psychiatry who has experience in conducting forensic interviews and in child and adult psychiatry. Any clinical team constituted under this section shall consist of three persons: A clinical psychologist with experience in child and adolescent psychology, and two of the following three types of professionals: (A) A clinical social worker licensed pursuant to chapter 383b, (B) a child and adolescent psychiatric nurse clinical specialist holding a master's degree in nursing, or (C) a physician specializing in psychiatry. At least one member of the clinical team shall have experience in conducting forensic interviews and at least one member of the clinical team shall have experience in child and adolescent psychology. The court may authorize a physician, a clinical psychologist, a child and adolescent psychiatric nurse specialist or a clinical social worker licensed pursuant to chapter 383b, selected by the child or youth, to observe the examination, at the expense of the child or youth or, if the child or youth is represented by counsel appointed through the Public Defender Services Commission, the Office of the Chief Public Defender. In addition, counsel for the child or youth, his or her designated representative and, if the child or youth is represented by a public defender, a social worker from the Division of Public Defender Services, may observe the examination.",
              "(e) The examination shall be completed not later than fifteen business days after the date it was ordered, unless the time for completion is extended by the court for good cause shown. The members of the clinical team or the examining physician shall prepare and sign, without notarization, a written report and file such report with the court not later than twenty-one business days after the date of the order. The report shall address the child's or youth's ability to understand the proceedings against such child or youth and such child's or youth's ability to assist in his or her own defense. If the opinion of the clinical team or the examining physician set forth in such report is that the child cannot understand the proceedings against such child or youth or is not able to assist in his or her own defense, the members of the team or the examining physician must determine and address in their report: (1) Whether there is a substantial probability that the child or youth will attain or regain competency within ninety days of an intervention being ordered by the court; and (2) the nature and type of intervention, in the least restrictive setting possible, recommended to attain or regain competency. On receipt of the written report, the clerk of the court shall cause copies of such written report to be delivered to counsel for the state and counsel for the child or youth at least forty-eight hours prior to the hearing held under subsection (f) of this section.",
              "(f) The court shall hold a hearing as to the competency of the child or youth not later than ten business days after the court receives the written report of the clinical team or the examining physician pursuant to subsection (e) of this section. A child or youth may waive such evidentiary hearing only if the clinical team or examining physician has determined without qualification that the child or youth is competent. Any evidence regarding the child's or youth's competency, including, but not limited to, the written report, may be introduced in evidence at the hearing by either the child or youth or the state. If the written report is introduced as evidence, at least one member of the clinical team or the examining physician shall be present to testify as to the determinations in the report, unless the clinical team's or the examining physician's presence is waived by the child or youth and the state. Any member of the clinical team shall be considered competent to testify as to the clinical team's determinations.",
              "(g) (1) If the court, after the competency hearing, finds by a preponderance of the evidence that the child or youth is competent, the court shall continue with the prosecution of the juvenile matter.",
              "(2) If the court, after the competency hearing, finds that the child or youth is not competent, the court shall determine: (A) Whether there is a substantial probability that the child or youth will attain or regain competency within ninety days of an intervention being ordered by the court; and (B) whether the recommended intervention to attain or regain competency is appropriate. In making its determination on an appropriate intervention, the court may consider: (i) The nature and circumstances of the alleged offense; (ii) the length of time the clinical team or examining physician estimates it will take for the child or youth to attain or regain competency; (iii) whether the child or youth poses a substantial risk to reoffend; and (iv) whether the child or youth is able to receive community-based services or treatment that would prevent the child or youth from reoffending.",
              "(h) If the court finds that there is not a substantial probability that the child or youth will attain or regain competency within ninety days or that the recommended intervention to attain or regain competency is not appropriate, the court may issue an order in accordance with subsection (k) of this section.",
              "(i) (1) If the court finds that there is a substantial probability that the child or youth will attain or regain competency within ninety days if provided an appropriate intervention, the court shall schedule a hearing on the implementation of such intervention within five business days.",
              "(2) An intervention implemented for the purpose of restoring competency shall comply with the following conditions: (A) The period of intervention shall not exceed ninety days, unless extended for an additional ninety days in accordance with the criteria set forth in subsection (j) of this section; and (B) the intervention services shall be provided by the Department of Children and Families or, if the child's or youth's parent or guardian agrees to pay for such services, by any appropriate person, agency, mental health facility or treatment program that agrees to provide appropriate intervention services in the least restrictive setting available to the child or youth and comply with the requirements of this section.",
              "(3) Prior to the hearing, the court shall notify the Commissioner of Children and Families, the commissioner's designee or the appropriate person, agency, mental health facility or treatment program that has agreed to provide appropriate intervention services to the child or youth that an intervention to attain or regain competency will be ordered. The commissioner, the commissioner's designee or the appropriate person, agency, mental health facility or treatment program shall be provided with a copy of the report of the clinical team or examining physician and shall report to the court on a proposed implementation of the intervention prior to the hearing.",
              "(4) At the hearing, the court shall review the written report and order an appropriate intervention for a period not to exceed ninety days in the least restrictive setting available to restore competency. In making its determination, the court shall use the criteria set forth in subdivision (2) of subsection (g) of this section. Upon ordering an intervention, the court shall set a date for a hearing, to be held at least ten business days after the completion of the intervention period, for the purpose of reassessing the child's or youth's competency.",
              "(j) (1) At least ten business days prior to the date of any scheduled hearing on the issue of the reassessment of the child's or youth's competency, the Commissioner of Children and Families, the commissioner's designee or other person, agency, mental health facility or treatment program providing intervention services to restore a child or youth to competency shall report on the progress of such intervention services to the clinical team or examining physician.",
              "(2) Upon receipt of the report on the progress of such intervention, the child or youth shall be reassessed by the original clinical team or examining physician, except that if the original team or examining physician is unavailable, the court may appoint a new clinical team that, where possible, shall include at least one member of the original team, or a new examining physician. The new clinical team or examining physician shall have the same qualifications as the original team or examining physician, as provided in subsection (d) of this section, and shall have access to clinical information available from the provider of the intervention services. Not less than two business days prior to the date of any scheduled hearing on the reassessment of the child's or youth's competency, the clinical team or examining physician shall submit a report to the court that includes: (A) The clinical findings of the provider of the intervention services and the facts upon which the findings are made; (B) the clinical team's or the examining physician's opinion on whether the child or youth has attained or regained competency or is making progress toward attaining or regaining competency within the period covered by the intervention order; and (C) any other information concerning the child or youth requested by the court, including, but not limited to, the method of intervention or the type, dosage and effect of any medication the child or youth is receiving.",
              "(3) Within two business days of the filing of a reassessment report, the court shall hold a hearing to determine if the child or youth has attained or regained competency within the period covered by the intervention order. If the court finds that the child or youth has attained or regained competency, the court shall continue with the prosecution of the juvenile matter. If the court finds that the child or youth has not attained or regained competency within the period covered by the intervention order, the court shall determine whether further efforts to attain or regain competency are appropriate. The court shall make its determination of whether further efforts to attain or regain competency are appropriate in accordance with the criteria set forth in subdivision (2) of subsection (g) of this section. If the court finds that further intervention to attain or regain competency is appropriate, the court shall order a new period for restoration of competency not to exceed ninety days. If the court finds that further intervention to attain or regain competency is not appropriate or the child or youth has not attained or regained competency after an additional intervention of ninety days, the court shall issue an order in accordance with subsection (k) of this section.",
              "(k) (1) If the court determines after the period covered by the intervention order that the child or youth has not attained or regained competency and that there is not a substantial probability that the child or youth will attain or regain competency, or that further intervention to attain or regain competency is not appropriate based on the criteria set forth in subdivision (2) of subsection (g) of this section, the court shall: (A) Dismiss the petition if it is a delinquency petition; (B) vest temporary custody of the child or youth in the Commissioner of Children and Families and notify the Office of the Chief Public Defender, which shall assign an attorney to serve as guardian ad litem for the child or youth and investigate whether a petition should be filed under section 46b-129 ; or (C) order that the Department of Children and Families or some other person, agency, mental health facility or treatment program, or such child's or youth's probation officer, conduct or obtain an appropriate assessment and, where appropriate, propose a plan for services that can appropriately address the child's or youth's needs in the least restrictive setting available and appropriate. Any plan for services may include a plan for interagency collaboration for the provision of appropriate services after the child or youth attains the age of eighteen.",
              "(2) Not later than ten business days after the issuance of an order pursuant to subparagraph (B) or (C) of subdivision (1) of this subsection, the court shall hold a hearing to review the order of temporary custody or any recommendations of the Department of Children and Families, such probation officer or such attorney or guardian ad litem for the child or youth.",
              "(3) If the child or youth is adjudicated neglected, uncared for or abused subsequent to such a petition being filed, or if a plan for services pursuant to subparagraph (C) of subdivision (1) of this subsection has been approved by the court and implemented, the court may dismiss the delinquency petition, or, in the discretion of the court, order that the prosecution of the case be suspended for a period not to exceed eighteen months. During the period of suspension, the court may order the Department of Children and Families to provide periodic reports to the court to ensure that appropriate services are being provided to the child or youth. If during the period of suspension, the child or youth or the parent or guardian of the child or youth does not comply with the requirements set forth in the plan for services, the court may hold a hearing to determine whether the court should follow the procedure under subparagraph (B) of subdivision (1) of this subsection for instituting a petition alleging that a child is neglected, uncared for or abused. Whenever the court finds that the need for the suspension of prosecution is no longer necessary, but not later than the expiration of such period of suspension, the delinquency petition shall be dismissed."

If the court finds that further intervention to attain or regain competency is not appropriate or the child or youth has not attained or regained competency after an additional intervention of ninety days, the court shall issue an order in accordance with subsection (k) of this section.\n\n(k) (1) If the court determines after the period covered by the intervention order that the child or youth has not attained or regained competency and that there is not a substantial probability that the child or youth will attain or regain competency, or that further intervention to attain or regain competency is not appropriate based on the criteria set forth in subdivision (2) of subsection (g) of this section, the court shall: (A) Dismiss the petition if it is a delinquency petition; (B) vest temporary custody of the child or youth in the Commissioner of Children and Families and notify the Office of the Chief Public Defender, which shall assign an attorney to serve as guardian ad litem for the child or youth and investigate whether a petition should be filed under section 46b-129 ; or (C) order that the Department of Children and Families or some other person, agency, mental health facility or treatment program, or such child's or youth's probation officer, conduct or obtain an appropriate assessment and, where appropriate, propose a plan for services that can appropriately address the child's or youth's needs in the least restrictive setting available and appropriate. Any plan for services may include a plan for interagency collaboration for the provision of appropriate services after the child or youth attains the age of eighteen.\n\n(2) Not later than ten business days after the issuance of an order pursuant to subparagraph (B) or (C) of subdivision (1) of this subsection, the court shall hold a hearing to review the order of temporary custody or any recommendations of the Department of Children and Families, such probation officer or such attorney or guardian ad litem for the child or youth.\n\n(3) If the child or youth is adjudicated neglected, uncared for or abused subsequent to such a petition being filed, or if a plan for services pursuant to subparagraph (C) of subdivision (1) of this subsection has been approved by the court and implemented, the court may dismiss the delinquency petition, or, in the discretion of the court, order that the prosecution of the case be suspended for a period not to exceed eighteen months. During the period of suspension, the court may order the Department of Children and Families to provide periodic reports to the court to ensure that appropriate services are being provided to the child or youth. If during the period of suspension, the child or youth or the parent or guardian of the child or youth does not comply with the requirements set forth in the plan for services, the court may hold a hearing to determine whether the court should follow the procedure under subparagraph (B) of subdivision (1) of this subsection for instituting a petition alleging that a child is neglected, uncared for or abused. Whenever the court finds that the need for the suspension of prosecution is no longer necessary, but not later than the expiration of such period of suspension, the delinquency petition shall be dismissed."

              "(b) If it appears from the specific allegations of the petition and other verified affirmations of fact accompanying the petition and application, or subsequent thereto, that there is reasonable cause to believe that (1) the child or youth is suffering from serious physical illness or serious physical injury or is in immediate physical danger from the child's or youth's surroundings, and (2) as a result of said conditions, the child's or youth's safety is endangered and immediate removal from such surroundings is necessary to ensure the child's or youth's safety, the court shall either (A) issue an order to the parents or other person having responsibility for the care of the child or youth to appear at such time as the court may designate to determine whether the court should vest the child's or youth's temporary care and custody in a person related to the child or youth by blood or marriage or in some other person or suitable agency pending disposition of the petition, or (B) issue an order ex parte vesting the child's or youth's temporary care and custody in a person related to the child or youth by blood or marriage or in some other person or suitable agency. A preliminary hearing on any ex parte custody order or order to appear issued by the court shall be held not later than ten days after the issuance of such order. The service of such orders may be made by any officer authorized by law to serve process, or by any probation officer appointed in accordance with section 46b-123 , investigator from the Department of Administrative Services, state or local police officer or indifferent person. Such orders shall include a conspicuous notice to the respondent written in clear and simple language containing at least the following information: (i) That the order contains allegations that conditions in the home have endangered the safety and welfare of the child or youth; (ii) that a hearing will be held on the date on the form; (iii) that the hearing is the opportunity to present the parents' position concerning the alleged facts; (iv) that an attorney will be appointed for parents who cannot afford an attorney; (v) that such parents may apply for a court-appointed attorney by going in person to the court address on the form and are advised to go as soon as possible in order for the attorney to prepare for the hearing; (vi) that such parents, or a person having responsibility for the care and custody of the child or youth, may request the Commissioner of Children and Families to investigate placing the child or youth with a person related to the child or youth by blood or marriage who might serve as a licensed foster parent or temporary custodian for such child or youth. The commissioner shall investigate any relative or relatives proposed to serve as a licensed foster parent or temporary custodian for such child or youth prior to the preliminary hearing and provide a preliminary report to the court at such hearing as to such relative's or relatives' suitability and any potential barriers to licensing such relative or relatives as a foster parent or parents or granting temporary custody of such child or youth to such relative or relatives; and (vii) that if such parents have any questions concerning the case or appointment of counsel, any such parent is advised to go to the court or call the clerk's office at the court as soon as possible. Upon application for appointed counsel, the court shall promptly determine eligibility and, if the respondent is eligible, promptly appoint counsel. The expense for any temporary care and custody shall be paid by the town in which such child or youth is at the time residing, and such town shall be reimbursed for such expense by the town found liable for the child's or youth's support, except that where a state agency has filed a petition pursuant to the provisions of subsection (a) of this section, the agency shall pay such expense. The agency shall give primary consideration to placing the child or youth in the town where such child or youth resides.

Upon issuance of an ex parte order, the court shall provide to the commissioner and the parent or guardian specific steps necessary for each to take to address the ex parte order for the parent or guardian to retain or regain custody of the child or youth. Upon the issuance of such order, or not later than sixty days after the issuance of such order, the court shall make a determination whether the Department of Children and Families made reasonable efforts to keep the child or youth with his or her parents or guardian prior to the issuance of such order and, if such efforts were not made, whether such reasonable efforts were not possible, taking into consideration the child's or youth's best interests, including the child's or youth's health and safety. Any person or agency in which the temporary care and custody of a child or youth is vested under this section shall have the following rights and duties regarding the child or youth: (I) The obligation of care and control; (II) the authority to make decisions regarding emergency medical, psychological, psychiatric or surgical treatment; and (III) such other rights and duties that the court having jurisdiction may order.",

              "(8) If the person named as the alleged genetic parent appears and admits that such person is the genetic parent, provide such person and the birth parent with the notices that comply with section 17b-27 and provide them with the opportunity to sign an acknowledgment of parentage on forms that comply with section 17b-27 . Such documents shall be executed and filed in accordance with chapter 815y and a copy delivered to the clerk of the superior court for juvenile matters. The clerk of the superior court for juvenile matters shall send the original acknowledgment of parentage to the Department of Public Health for filing in the parentage registry maintained under section 19a-42a , and shall maintain a copy of the acknowledgment of parentage in the court file;",
              "(9) If the person named as an alleged genetic parent appears and denies that such person is the genetic parent of the child or youth, order genetic testing to determine parentage in accordance with the Connecticut Parentage Act. The clerk of the court shall send a certified copy of any judgment adjudicating parentage to the Department of Public Health for filing in the parentage registry maintained under section 19a-42a . If the results of the genetic tests indicate that the person named as the alleged genetic parent is not the genetic parent of the child or youth, the court shall enter a judgment that such person is not the genetic parent and the court shall remove such person from the case and afford such person no further standing in the case or in any subsequent proceeding regarding the child or youth;",

              "(11) In accordance with the provisions of the Interstate Compact on the Placement of Children pursuant to section 17a-175 , identify any person or persons related to the child or youth by blood, marriage or law residing out of state who might serve as licensed foster parents or temporary custodians, and order the Commissioner of Children and Families to investigate and determine, within a reasonable time, the appropriateness of placing the child or youth with such relative or relatives.",
              "(d) (1) (A) If not later than thirty days after the preliminary hearing, or within a reasonable time when a relative resides out of state, the Commissioner of Children and Families determines that there is not a suitable person related to the child or youth by blood or marriage who can be licensed as a foster parent or serve as a temporary custodian, and the court has not granted temporary custody to a person related to the child or youth by blood or marriage, any person related to the child or youth by blood or marriage may file, not later than ninety days after the date of the preliminary hearing, a motion to intervene for the limited purpose of moving for temporary custody of such child or youth.

The granting of such motion shall be solely in the court's discretion, except that such motion shall be granted absent good cause shown whenever the child's or youth's most recent placement has been disrupted or is about to be disrupted.",
              "(C) A relative shall appear in person, with or without counsel, and shall not be entitled to court appointed counsel or the assignment of counsel by the office of Chief Public Defender, except as provided in section 46b-136 .",
              "(2) Upon the granting of intervenor status to such relative of the child or youth, the court shall issue an order directing the Commissioner of Children and Families to conduct an assessment of such relative and to file a written report with the court not later than forty days after such order, unless such relative resides out of state, in which case the assessment shall be ordered and requested in accordance with the provisions of the Interstate Compact on the Placement of Children, pursuant to section 17a-175 . The court may also request such relative to release such relative's medical records, including any psychiatric or psychological records and may order such relative to submit to a physical or mental examination. The expenses incurred for such physical or mental examination shall be paid as costs of commitment are paid. Upon receipt of the assessment, the court shall schedule a hearing on such relative's motion for temporary custody not later than fifteen days after the receipt of the assessment. If the Commissioner of Children and Families, the child's or youth's attorney or guardian ad litem, or the parent or guardian objects to the vesting of temporary custody in such relative, the agency or person objecting at such hearing shall be required to prove by a fair preponderance of the evidence that granting temporary custody of the child or youth to such relative would not be in the best interests of such child or youth.",
              "(3) If the court grants such relative temporary custody during the period of such temporary custody, such relative shall be subject to orders of the court, including, but not limited to, providing for the care and supervision of such child or youth and cooperating with the Commissioner of Children and Families in the implementation of treatment and permanency plans and services for such child or youth. The court may, on motion of any party or the court's own motion, after notice and a hearing, terminate such relative's intervenor status if such relative's participation in the case is no longer warranted or necessary.",

              "(f) Upon request, or upon its own motion, the court shall schedule a hearing on the order for temporary custody or the order to appear to be held not later than ten days after the date of the preliminary hearing. Such hearing shall be held on consecutive days except for compelling circumstances or at the request of the parent or guardian.",
              "(g) At a contested hearing on the order for temporary custody or order to appear, credible hearsay evidence regarding statements of the child or youth made to a mandated reporter or to a parent may be offered by the parties and admitted by the court upon a finding that the statement is reliable and trustworthy and that admission of such statement is reasonably necessary. A signed statement executed by a mandated reporter under oath may be admitted by the court without the need for the mandated reporter to appear and testify unless called by a respondent or the child, provided the statement: (1) Was provided at the preliminary hearing and promptly upon request to any counsel appearing after the preliminary hearing; (2) reasonably describes the qualifications of the reporter and the nature of his contact with the child; and (3) contains only the direct observations of the reporter, and statements made to the reporter that would be admissible if the reporter were to testify to them in court and any opinions reasonably based thereupon. If a respondent or the child gives notice at the preliminary hearing that he intends to cross-examine the reporter, the person filing the petition shall make the reporter available for such examination at the contested hearing.",
              "(h) If any parent or guardian fails, after due notice of the hearing scheduled pursuant to subsection (g) of this section and without good cause, to appear at the scheduled date for a contested hearing on the order of temporary custody or order to appear, the court may enter or sustain an order of temporary custody.",

The court after hearing may also order a thorough physical or mental examination, or both, of a parent or guardian whose competency or ability to care for a child or youth before the court is at issue. The expenses incurred in making such physical and mental examinations shall be paid as costs of commitment are paid.",
              "(j) (1) For the purposes of this subsection and subsection (k) of this section, (A) “permanent legal guardianship” means a permanent guardianship, as defined in section 45a-604 , (B) “caregiver” means (i) a fictive kin caregiver, as defined in section 17a-114 , who is caring for a child, (ii) a relative caregiver, as defined in section 17a-126 , who is caring for a child, or (iii) a person who is licensed or approved to provide foster care pursuant to section 17a-114 , who is caring for a child, and (C) “trial home visit” means the temporary placement of a child or youth committed to the Commissioner of Children and Families in the home of such child's or youth's parent or guardian.",
              "(2) Upon finding and adjudging that any child or youth is uncared for, neglected or abused the court may (A) commit such child or youth to the Commissioner of Children and Families, and such commitment shall remain in effect until further order of the court, except that such commitment may be revoked or parental rights terminated at any time by the court; (B) vest such child's or youth's legal guardianship in any private or public agency that is permitted by law to care for neglected, uncared for or abused children or youths or with any other person or persons found to be suitable and worthy of such responsibility by the court, including, but not limited to, any relative of such child or youth by blood or marriage; (C) vest such child's or youth's permanent legal guardianship in any person or persons found to be suitable and worthy of such responsibility by the court, including, but not limited to, any relative of such child or youth by blood or marriage in accordance with the requirements set forth in subdivision (6) of this subsection; or (D) place the child or youth in the custody of the parent or guardian with protective supervision by the Commissioner of Children and Families subject to conditions established by the court.",
              "(3) If the court approves a permanency plan filed with the court that recommends the reunification of the child or youth with such child's or youth's parent or guardian, the Commissioner of Children and Families may, with the agreement of all parties of record, authorize a trial home visit prior to the revocation of the order of commitment pertaining to such child or youth. The commissioner shall (A) provide the court and all parties of record written notice of the commissioner's intent to authorize any such trial home visit not later than fifteen days prior to such authorization; (B) create a trial home visit plan that shall be provided to all parties of record, and include, but need not be limited to, announced and unannounced visits to the home by the department and the provision of any services during such trial home visit that the commissioner determines are necessary to promote the child's or youth's well-being; and (C) file a motion for revocation of commitment not later than thirty days after the date such trial home visit commences, unless the commissioner removes the child or youth from the home prior to that time pursuant to its responsibility and authority over children and youth committed to the care and custody of the commissioner. A trial home visit authorized under this section shall remain in effect until the commissioner removes such child or youth pursuant to subparagraph (C) of this subdivision or the court grants a motion for revocation of commitment filed pursuant to said subparagraph.",
              "(4) If the court determines that the commitment should be revoked and the child's or youth's legal guardianship or permanent legal guardianship should vest in someone other than the respondent parent, parents or former guardian, or if parental rights are terminated at any time, there shall be a rebuttable presumption that an award of legal guardianship or permanent legal guardianship upon revocation to, or adoption upon termination of parental rights by, any caregiver or person or who is, pursuant to an order of the court, the temporary custodian of the child or youth at the time of the revocation or termination, shall be in the best interests of the child or youth and that such caregiver is a suitable and worthy person to assume legal guardianship or permanent legal guardianship upon revocation or to adopt such child or youth upon termination of parental rights. The presumption may be rebutted by a preponderance of the evidence that an award of legal guardianship or permanent legal guardianship to, or an adoption by, such caregiver would not be in the child's or youth's best interests and such caregiver is not a suitable and worthy person. The court shall order specific steps that the parent must take to facilitate the return of the child or youth to the custody of such parent.",
              "(5) The commissioner shall be the guardian of such child or youth for the duration of the commitment, provided the child or youth has not reached the age of eighteen years, or until another guardian has been legally appointed, and in like manner, upon such vesting of the care of such child or youth, such other public or private agency or individual shall be the guardian of such child or youth until such child or youth has reached the age of eighteen years or, in the case of a child or youth in full-time attendance in a secondary school, a technical education and career school, a college or a state-accredited job training program, until such child or youth has reached the age of twenty-one years or until another guardian has been legally appointed. The commissioner may place any child or youth so committed to the commissioner in a suitable foster home or in the home of a fictive kin caregiver, relative caregiver, or in a licensed child-caring institution or in the care and custody of any accredited, licensed or approved child-caring agency, within or without the state, provided a child shall not be placed outside the state except for good cause and unless the parents or guardian of such child are notified in advance of such placement and given an opportunity to be heard, or in a receiving home maintained and operated by the commissioner. When placing such child or youth, the commissioner shall provide written notification of the placement, including the name, address and other relevant contact information relating to the placement, to any attorney or guardian ad litem appointed to represent the child or youth pursuant to subsection (c) of this section. The commissioner shall provide written notification to such attorney or guardian ad litem of any change in placement of such child or youth, including a hospitalization or respite placement, and if the child or youth absconds from care. The commissioner shall provide such written notification not later than ten business days prior to the date of change of placement in a nonemergency situation, or not later than two business days following the date of a change of placement in an emergency situation. In placing such child or youth, the commissioner shall, if possible, select a home, agency, institution or person of like religious faith to that of a parent of such child or youth, if such faith is known or may be ascertained by reasonable inquiry, provided such home conforms to the standards of the commissioner and the commissioner shall, when placing siblings, if possible, place such children together. At least ten days prior to transferring a child or youth to a second or subsequent placement, the commissioner shall give written notice to such child or youth and such child's or youth's attorney of said commissioner's intention to make such transfer, unless an emergency or risk to such child's or youth's well-being necessitates the immediate transfer of such child and renders such notice impossible. Upon the issuance of an order committing the child or youth to the commissioner, or not later than sixty days after the issuance of such order, the court shall determine whether the department made reasonable efforts to keep the child or youth with his or her parents or guardian prior to the issuance of such order and, if such efforts were not made, whether such reasonable efforts were not possible, taking into consideration the child's or youth's best interests, including the child's or youth's health and safety.",
              "(6) A youth who is committed to the commissioner pursuant to this subsection and has reached eighteen years of age may remain in the care of the commissioner, by consent of the youth and provided the youth has not reached the age of twenty-one years of age, if the youth is (A) enrolled in a full-time approved secondary education program or an approved program leading to an equivalent credential; (B) enrolled full time in an institution which provides postsecondary or vocational education; or (C) participating full time in a program or activity approved by said commissioner that is designed to promote or remove barriers to employment. The commissioner, in the commissioner's discretion, may waive the provision of full-time enrollment or participation based on compelling circumstances. Not more than one hundred twenty days after the youth's eighteenth birthday, the department shall file a motion in the superior court for juvenile matters that had jurisdiction over the youth's case prior to the youth's eighteenth birthday for a determination as to whether continuation in care is in the youth's best interest and, if so, whether there is an appropriate permanency plan. The court, in its discretion, may hold a hearing on said motion.",
              "(7) Prior to issuing an order for permanent legal guardianship, the court shall provide notice to each parent that the parent may not file a motion to terminate the permanent legal guardianship, or the court shall indicate on the record why such notice could not be provided, and the court shall find by clear and convincing evidence that the permanent legal guardianship is in the best interests of the child or youth and that the following have been proven by clear and convincing evidence:",
              "(A) One of the statutory grounds for termination of parental rights exists, as set forth in subsection (j) of section 17a-112 , or the parents have voluntarily consented to the establishment of the permanent legal guardianship;",
              "(B) Adoption of the child or youth is not possible or appropriate;",
              "(C) (i) If the child or youth is at least twelve years of age, such child or youth consents to the proposed permanent legal guardianship, or (ii) if the child is under twelve years of age, the proposed permanent legal guardian is: (I) A relative, (II) a caregiver, or (III) already serving as the permanent legal guardian of at least one of the child's siblings, if any;",
              "(D) The child or youth has resided with the proposed permanent legal guardian for at least a year; and",
              "(E) The proposed permanent legal guardian is (i) a suitable and worthy person, and (ii) committed to remaining the permanent legal guardian and assuming the right and responsibilities for the child or youth until the child or youth attains the age of majority.",
              "(8) An order of permanent legal guardianship may be reopened and modified and the permanent legal guardian removed upon the filing of a motion with the court, provided it is proven by a fair preponderance of the evidence that the permanent legal guardian is no longer suitable and worthy. A parent may not file a motion to terminate a permanent legal guardianship. If, after a hearing, the court terminates a permanent legal guardianship, the court, in appointing a successor legal guardian or permanent legal guardian for the child or youth shall do so in accordance with this subsection.",
              "(k) (1) (A) Nine months after placement of the child or youth in the care and custody of the commissioner pursuant to a voluntary placement agreement, or removal of a child or youth pursuant to section 17a-101g or an order issued by a court of competent jurisdiction, whichever is earlier, the commissioner shall file a motion for review of a permanency plan if the child or youth has not reached his or her eighteenth birthday. Nine months after a permanency plan has been approved by the court pursuant to this subsection or subdivision (5) of subsection (j) of this section, the commissioner shall file a motion for review of the permanency plan. Any party seeking to oppose the commissioner's permanency plan, including a relative of a child or youth by blood or marriage who has intervened pursuant to subsection (d) of this section and is licensed as a foster parent for such child or youth or is vested with such child's or youth's temporary custody by order of the court, shall file a motion in opposition not later than thirty days after the filing of the commissioner's motion for review of the permanency plan, which motion shall include the reason therefor. A permanency hearing on any motion for review of the permanency plan shall be held not later than ninety days after the filing of such motion. The court shall hold evidentiary hearings in connection with any contested motion for review of the permanency plan and credible hearsay evidence regarding any party's compliance with specific steps ordered by the court shall be admissible at such evidentiary hearings. The commissioner shall have the burden of proving that the proposed permanency plan is in the best interests of the child or youth.

Upon the filing of such a petition, except as otherwise provided in subsection (k) of section 17a-112 , the court shall cause a summons to be issued requiring the parent or parents or the guardian of the child or youth to appear in court at the time and place named, which summons shall be served not less than fourteen days before the date of the hearing in the manner prescribed by section 46b-128 , and the court shall further give notice to the petitioner and to the Commissioner of Children and Families of the time and place when the petition is to be heard not less than fourteen days prior to the hearing in question.\n\n(b) If it appears from the specific allegations of the petition and other verified affirmations of fact accompanying the petition and application, or subsequent thereto, that there is reasonable cause to believe that (1) the child or youth is suffering from serious physical illness or serious physical injury or is in immediate physical danger from the child's or youth's surroundings, and (2) as a result of said conditions, the child's or youth's safety is endangered and immediate removal from such surroundings is necessary to ensure the child's or youth's safety, the court shall either (A) issue an order to the parents or other person having responsibility for the care of the child or youth to appear at such time as the court may designate to determine whether the court should vest the child's or youth's temporary care and custody in a person related to the child or youth by blood or marriage or in some other person or suitable agency pending disposition of the petition, or (B) issue an order ex parte vesting the child's or youth's temporary care and custody in a person related to the child or youth by blood or marriage or in some other person or suitable agency. A preliminary hearing on any ex parte custody order or order to appear issued by the court shall be held not later than ten days after the issuance of such order. The service of such orders may be made by any officer authorized by law to serve process, or by any probation officer appointed in accordance with section 46b-123 , investigator from the Department of Administrative Services, state or local police officer or indifferent person. Such orders shall include a conspicuous notice to the respondent written in clear and simple language containing at least the following information: (i) That the order contains allegations that conditions in the home have endangered the safety and welfare of the child or youth; (ii) that a hearing will be held on the date on the form; (iii) that the hearing is the opportunity to present the parents' position concerning the alleged facts; (iv) that an attorney will be appointed for parents who cannot afford an attorney; (v) that such parents may apply for a court-appointed attorney by going in person to the court address on the form and are advised to go as soon as possible in order for the attorney to prepare for the hearing; (vi) that such parents, or a person having responsibility for the care and custody of the child or youth, may request the Commissioner of Children and Families to investigate placing the child or youth with a person related to the child or youth by blood or marriage who might serve as a licensed foster parent or temporary custodian for such child or youth. The commissioner shall investigate any relative or relatives proposed to serve as a licensed foster parent or temporary custodian for such child or youth prior to the preliminary hearing and provide a preliminary report to the court at such hearing as to such relative's or relatives' suitability and any potential barriers to licensing such relative or relatives as a foster parent or parents or granting temporary custody of such child or youth to such relative or relatives; and (vii) that if such parents have any questions concerning the case or appointment of counsel, any such parent is advised to go to the court or call the clerk's office at the court as soon as possible. Upon application for appointed counsel, the court shall promptly determine eligibility and, if the respondent is eligible, promptly appoint counsel. The expense for any temporary care and custody shall be paid by the town in which such child or youth is at the time residing, and such town shall be reimbursed for such expense by the town found liable for the child's or youth's support, except that where a state agency has filed a petition pursuant to the provisions of subsection (a) of this section, the agency shall pay such expense. The agency shall give primary consideration to placing the child or youth in the town where such child or youth resides. The agency shall file in writing with the clerk of the court the reasons for placing the child or youth in a particular placement outside the town where the child or youth resides. Upon issuance of an ex parte order, the court shall provide to the commissioner and the parent or guardian specific steps necessary for each to take to address the ex parte order for the parent or guardian to retain or regain custody of the child or youth. Upon the issuance of such order, or not later than sixty days after the issuance of such order, the court shall make a determination whether the Department of Children and Families made reasonable efforts to keep the child or youth with his or her parents or guardian prior to the issuance of such order and, if such efforts were not made, whether such reasonable efforts were not possible, taking into consideration the child's or youth's best interests, including the child's or youth's health and safety. Any person or agency in which the temporary care and custody of a child or youth is vested under this section shall have the following rights and duties regarding the child or youth: (I) The obligation of care and control; (II) the authority to make decisions regarding emergency medical, psychological, psychiatric or surgical treatment; and (III) such other rights and duties that the court having jurisdiction may order.\n\n(c) The preliminary hearing on the order of temporary custody or order to appear or the first hearing on a petition filed pursuant to subsection (a) of this section shall be held in order for the court to:\n\n(1) Advise the parent or guardian of the allegations contained in all petitions and applications that are the subject of the hearing and the parent's or guardian's right to counsel pursuant to subsection (b) of section 46b-135 ;\n\n(2) Ensure that an attorney, and where appropriate, a separate guardian ad litem has been appointed to represent the child or youth in accordance with subsection (b) of section 51-296a and sections 46b-129a and 46b-136 ;\n\n(3) Upon request, appoint an attorney to represent the respondent when the respondent is unable to afford representation, in accordance with subsection (b) of section 51-296a ;\n\n(4) Advise the parent or guardian of the right to a hearing on the petitions and applications, to be held not later than ten days after the date of the preliminary hearing if the hearing is pursuant to an order of temporary custody or an order to show cause;\n\n(5) Accept a plea regarding the truth of the allegations;\n\n(6) Make any interim orders, including visitation orders, that the court determines are in the best interests of the child or youth. The court, after a hearing pursuant to this subsection, shall order specific steps the commissioner and the parent or guardian shall take for the parent or guardian to regain or to retain custody of the child or youth;\n\n(7) Take steps to determine the identity of the alleged genetic parent of the child or youth, including, if necessary, inquiring of the birth parent of the child or youth, under oath, as to the identity and address of any person who might be the genetic parent of the child or youth and ordering genetic testing, and order service of the petition and notice of the hearing date, if any, to be made upon such alleged genetic parent;\n\n(8) If the person named as the alleged genetic parent appears and admits that such person is the genetic parent, provide such person and the birth parent with the notices that comply with section 17b-27 and provide them with the opportunity to sign an acknowledgment of parentage on forms that comply with section 17b-27 . Such documents shall be executed and filed in accordance with chapter 815y and a copy delivered to the clerk of the superior court for juvenile matters. The clerk of the superior court for juvenile matters shall send the original acknowledgment of parentage to the Department of Public Health for filing in the parentage registry maintained under section 19a-42a , and shall maintain a copy of the acknowledgment of parentage in the court file;\n\n(9) If the person named as an alleged genetic parent appears and denies that such person is the genetic parent of the child or youth, order genetic testing to determine parentage in accordance with the Connecticut Parentage Act. The clerk of the court shall send a certified copy of any judgment adjudicating parentage to the Department of Public Health for filing in the parentage registry maintained under section 19a-42a . If the results of the genetic tests indicate that the person named as the alleged genetic parent is not the genetic parent of the child or youth, the court shall enter a judgment that such person is not the genetic parent and the court shall remove such person from the case and afford such person no further standing in the case or in any subsequent proceeding regarding the child or youth;\n\n(10) Identify any person or persons related to the child or youth by blood, marriage or law residing in this state who might serve as licensed foster parents or temporary custodians and order the Commissioner of Children and Families to investigate and report to the court, not later than thirty days after the preliminary hearing, the appropriateness of placing the child or youth with such relative or relatives; and\n\n(11) In accordance with the provisions of the Interstate Compact on the Placement of Children pursuant to section 17a-175 , identify any person or persons related to the child or youth by blood, marriage or law residing out of state who might serve as licensed foster parents or temporary custodians, and order the Commissioner of Children and Families to investigate and determine, within a reasonable time, the appropriateness of placing the child or youth with such relative or relatives.\n\n(d) (1) (A) If not later than thirty days after the preliminary hearing, or within a reasonable time when a relative resides out of state, the Commissioner of Children and Families determines that there is not a suitable person related to the child or youth by blood or marriage who can be licensed as a foster parent or serve as a temporary custodian, and the court has not granted temporary custody to a person related to the child or youth by blood or marriage, any person related to the child or youth by blood or marriage may file, not later than ninety days after the date of the preliminary hearing, a motion to intervene for the limited purpose of moving for temporary custody of such child or youth. If a motion to intervene is timely filed, the court shall grant such motion except for good cause shown.\n\n(B) Any person related to a child or youth may file a motion to intervene for purposes of seeking temporary custody of a child or youth more than ninety days after the date of the preliminary hearing. The granting of such motion shall be solely in the court's discretion, except that such motion shall be granted absent good cause shown whenever the child's or youth's most recent placement has been disrupted or is about to be disrupted.\n\n(C) A relative shall appear in person, with or without counsel, and shall not be entitled to court appointed counsel or the assignment of counsel by the office of Chief Public Defender, except as provided in section 46b-136 .\n\n(2) Upon the granting of intervenor status to such relative of the child or youth, the court shall issue an order directing the Commissioner of Children and Families to conduct an assessment of such relative and to file a written report with the court not later than forty days after such order, unless such relative resides out of state, in which case the assessment shall be ordered and requested in accordance with the provisions of the Interstate Compact on the Placement of Children, pursuant to section 17a-175 . The court may also request such relative to release such relative's medical records, including any psychiatric or psychological records and may order such relative to submit to a physical or mental examination. The expenses incurred for such physical or mental examination shall be paid as costs of commitment are paid. Upon receipt of the assessment, the court shall schedule a hearing on such relative's motion for temporary custody not later than fifteen days after the receipt of the assessment. If the Commissioner of Children and Families, the child's or youth's attorney or guardian ad litem, or the parent or guardian objects to the vesting of temporary custody in such relative, the agency or person objecting at such hearing shall be required to prove by a fair preponderance of the evidence that granting temporary custody of the child or youth to such relative would not be in the best interests of such child or youth.\n\n(3) If the court grants such relative temporary custody during the period of such temporary custody, such relative shall be subject to orders of the court, including, but not limited to, providing for the care and supervision of such child or youth and cooperating with the Commissioner of Children and Families in the implementation of treatment and permanency plans and services for such child or youth. The court may, on motion of any party or the court's own motion, after notice and a hearing, terminate such relative's intervenor status if such relative's participation in the case is no longer warranted or necessary.\n\n(4) Any person related to a child or youth may file a motion to intervene for purposes of seeking guardianship of a child or youth more than ninety days after the date of the preliminary hearing. The granting of such motion to intervene shall be solely in the court's discretion, except that such motion shall be granted absent good cause shown whenever the child's or youth's most recent placement has been disrupted or is about to be disrupted. The court may, in the court's discretion, order the Commissioner of Children and Families to conduct an assessment of such relative granted intervenor status pursuant to this subdivision.\n\n(5) Any relative granted intervenor status pursuant to this subsection shall not be entitled to court-appointed counsel or representation by Division of Public Defender Services assigned counsel, except as provided in section 46b-136 .\n\n(e) If any parent or guardian fails, after service of such order, to appear at the preliminary hearing, the court may enter or sustain an order of temporary custody.\n\n(f) Upon request, or upon its own motion, the court shall schedule a hearing on the order for temporary custody or the order to appear to be held not later than ten days after the date of the preliminary hearing. Such hearing shall be held on consecutive days except for compelling circumstances or at the request of the parent or guardian.\n\n(g) At a contested hearing on the order for temporary custody or order to appear, credible hearsay evidence regarding statements of the child or youth made to a mandated reporter or to a parent may be offered by the parties and admitted by the court upon a finding that the statement is reliable and trustworthy and that admission of such statement is reasonably necessary. A signed statement executed by a mandated reporter under oath may be admitted by the court without the need for the mandated reporter to appear and testify unless called by a respondent or the child, provided the statement: (1) Was provided at the preliminary hearing and promptly upon request to any counsel appearing after the preliminary hearing; (2) reasonably describes the qualifications of the reporter and the nature of his contact with the child; and (3) contains only the direct observations of the reporter, and statements made to the reporter that would be admissible if the reporter were to testify to them in court and any opinions reasonably based thereupon. If a respondent or the child gives notice at the preliminary hearing that he intends to cross-examine the reporter, the person filing the petition shall make the reporter available for such examination at the contested hearing.\n\n(h) If any parent or guardian fails, after due notice of the hearing scheduled pursuant to subsection (g) of this section and without good cause, to appear at the scheduled date for a contested hearing on the order of temporary custody or order to appear, the court may enter or sustain an order of temporary custody.\n\n(i) When a petition is filed in said court for the commitment of a child or youth, the Commissioner of Children and Families shall make a thorough investigation of the case and shall cause to be made a thorough physical and mental examination of the child or youth if requested by the court. The court after hearing may also order a thorough physical or mental examination, or both, of a parent or guardian whose competency or ability to care for a child or youth before the court is at issue. The expenses incurred in making such physical and mental examinations shall be paid as costs of commitment are paid.\n\n(j) (1) For the purposes of this subsection and subsection (k) of this section, (A) “permanent legal guardianship” means a permanent guardianship, as defined in section 45a-604 , (B) “caregiver” means (i) a fictive kin caregiver, as defined in section 17a-114 , who is caring for a child, (ii) a relative caregiver, as defined in section 17a-126 , who is caring for a child, or (iii) a person who is licensed or approved to provide foster care pursuant to section 17a-114 , who is caring for a child, and (C) “trial home visit” means the temporary placement of a child or youth committed to the Commissioner of Children and Families in the home of such child's or youth's parent or guardian.\n\n(2) Upon finding and adjudging that any child or youth is uncared for, neglected or abused the court may (A) commit such child or youth to the Commissioner of Children and Families, and such commitment shall remain in effect until further order of the court, except that such commitment may be revoked or parental rights terminated at any time by the court; (B) vest such child's or youth's legal guardianship in any private or public agency that is permitted by law to care for neglected, uncared for or abused children or youths or with any other person or persons found to be suitable and worthy of such responsibility by the court, including, but not limited to, any relative of such child or youth by blood or marriage; (C) vest such child's or youth's permanent legal guardianship in any person or persons found to be suitable and worthy of such responsibility by the court, including, but not limited to, any relative of such child or youth by blood or marriage in accordance with the requirements set forth in subdivision (6) of this subsection; or (D) place the child or youth in the custody of the parent or guardian with protective supervision by the Commissioner of Children and Families subject to conditions established by the court.\n\n(3) If the court approves a permanency plan filed with the court that recommends the reunification of the child or youth with such child's or youth's parent or guardian, the Commissioner of Children and Families may, with the agreement of all parties of record, authorize a trial home visit prior to the revocation of the order of commitment pertaining to such child or youth. The commissioner shall (A) provide the court and all parties of record written notice of the commissioner's intent to authorize any such trial home visit not later than fifteen days prior to such authorization; (B) create a trial home visit plan that shall be provided to all parties of record, and include, but need not be limited to, announced and unannounced visits to the home by the department and the provision of any services during such trial home visit that the commissioner determines are necessary to promote the child's or youth's well-being; and (C) file a motion for revocation of commitment not later than thirty days after the date such trial home visit commences, unless the commissioner removes the child or youth from the home prior to that time pursuant to its responsibility and authority over children and youth committed to the care and custody of the commissioner. A trial home visit authorized under this section shall remain in effect until the commissioner removes such child or youth pursuant to subparagraph (C) of this subdivision or the court grants a motion for revocation of commitment filed pursuant to said subparagraph.\n\n(4) If the court determines that the commitment should be revoked and the child's or youth's legal guardianship or permanent legal guardianship should vest in someone other than the respondent parent, parents or former guardian, or if parental rights are terminated at any time, there shall be a rebuttable presumption that an award of legal guardianship or permanent legal guardianship upon revocation to, or adoption upon termination of parental rights by, any caregiver or person or who is, pursuant to an order of the court, the temporary custodian of the child or youth at the time of the revocation or termination, shall be in the best interests of the child or youth and that such caregiver is a suitable and worthy person to assume legal guardianship or permanent legal guardianship upon revocation or to adopt such child or youth upon termination of parental rights. The presumption may be rebutted by a preponderance of the evidence that an award of legal guardianship or permanent legal guardianship to, or an adoption by, such caregiver would not be in the child's or youth's best interests and such caregiver is not a suitable and worthy person. The court shall order specific steps that the parent must take to facilitate the return of the child or youth to the custody of such parent.\n\n(5) The commissioner shall be the guardian of such child or youth for the duration of the commitment, provided the child or youth has not reached the age of eighteen years, or until another guardian has been legally appointed, and in like manner, upon such vesting of the care of such child or youth, such other public or private agency or individual shall be the guardian of such child or youth until such child or youth has reached the age of eighteen years or, in the case of a child or youth in full-time attendance in a secondary school, a technical education and career school, a college or a state-accredited job training program, until such child or youth has reached the age of twenty-one years or until another guardian has been legally appointed. The commissioner may place any child or youth so committed to the commissioner in a suitable foster home or in the home of a fictive kin caregiver, relative caregiver, or in a licensed child-caring institution or in the care and custody of any accredited, licensed or approved child-caring agency, within or without the state, provided a child shall not be placed outside the state except for good cause and unless the parents or guardian of such child are notified in advance of such placement and given an opportunity to be heard, or in a receiving home maintained and operated by the commissioner. When placing such child or youth, the commissioner shall provide written notification of the placement, including the name, address and other relevant contact information relating to the placement, to any attorney or guardian ad litem appointed to represent the child or youth pursuant to subsection (c) of this section. The commissioner shall provide written notification to such attorney or guardian ad litem of any change in placement of such child or youth, including a hospitalization or respite placement, and if the child or youth absconds from care. The commissioner shall provide such written notification not later than ten business days prior to the date of change of placement in a nonemergency situation, or not later than two business days following the date of a change of placement in an emergency situation. In placing such child or youth, the commissioner shall, if possible, select a home, agency, institution or person of like religious faith to that of a parent of such child or youth, if such faith is known or may be ascertained by reasonable inquiry, provided such home conforms to the standards of the commissioner and the commissioner shall, when placing siblings, if possible, place such children together. At least ten days prior to transferring a child or youth to a second or subsequent placement, the commissioner shall give written notice to such child or youth and such child's or youth's attorney of said commissioner's intention to make such transfer, unless an emergency or risk to such child's or youth's well-being necessitates the immediate transfer of such child and renders such notice impossible. Upon the issuance of an order committing the child or youth to the commissioner, or not later than sixty days after the issuance of such order, the court shall determine whether the department made reasonable efforts to keep the child or youth with his or her parents or guardian prior to the issuance of such order and, if such efforts were not made, whether such reasonable efforts were not possible, taking into consideration the child's or youth's best interests, including the child's or youth's health and safety.\n\n(6) A youth who is committed to the commissioner pursuant to this subsection and has reached eighteen years of age may remain in the care of the commissioner, by consent of the youth and provided the youth has not reached the age of twenty-one years of age, if the youth is (A) enrolled in a full-time approved secondary education program or an approved program leading to an equivalent credential; (B) enrolled full time in an institution which provides postsecondary or vocational education; or (C) participating full time in a program or activity approved by said commissioner that is designed to promote or remove barriers to employment. The commissioner, in the commissioner's discretion, may waive the provision of full-time enrollment or participation based on compelling circumstances. Not more than one hundred twenty days after the youth's eighteenth birthday, the department shall file a motion in the superior court for juvenile matters that had jurisdiction over the youth's case prior to the youth's eighteenth birthday for a determination as to whether continuation in care is in the youth's best interest and, if so, whether there is an appropriate permanency plan. The court, in its discretion, may hold a hearing on said motion.\n\n(7) Prior to issuing an order for permanent legal guardianship, the court shall provide notice to each parent that the parent may not file a motion to terminate the permanent legal guardianship, or the court shall indicate on the record why such notice could not be provided, and the court shall find by clear and convincing evidence that the permanent legal guardianship is in the best interests of the child or youth and that the following have been proven by clear and convincing evidence:\n\n(A) One of the statutory grounds for termination of parental rights exists, as set forth in subsection (j) of section 17a-112 , or the parents have voluntarily consented to the establishment of the permanent legal guardianship;\n\n(B) Adoption of the child or youth is not possible or appropriate;\n\n(C) (i) If the child or youth is at least twelve years of age, such child or youth consents to the proposed permanent legal guardianship, or (ii) if the child is under twelve years of age, the proposed permanent legal guardian is: (I) A relative, (II) a caregiver, or (III) already serving as the permanent legal guardian of at least one of the child's siblings, if any;\n\n(D) The child or youth has resided with the proposed permanent legal guardian for at least a year; and\n\n(E) The proposed permanent legal guardian is (i) a suitable and worthy person, and (ii) committed to remaining the permanent legal guardian and assuming the right and responsibilities for the child or youth until the child or youth attains the age of majority.\n\n(8) An order of permanent legal guardianship may be reopened and modified and the permanent legal guardian removed upon the filing of a motion with the court, provided it is proven by a fair preponderance of the evidence that the permanent legal guardian is no longer suitable and worthy. A parent may not file a motion to terminate a permanent legal guardianship. If, after a hearing, the court terminates a permanent legal guardianship, the court, in appointing a successor legal guardian or permanent legal guardian for the child or youth shall do so in accordance with this subsection.\n\n(k) (1) (A) Nine months after placement of the child or youth in the care and custody of the commissioner pursuant to a voluntary placement agreement, or removal of a child or youth pursuant to section 17a-101g or an order issued by a court of competent jurisdiction, whichever is earlier, the commissioner shall file a motion for review of a permanency plan if the child or youth has not reached his or her eighteenth birthday. Nine months after a permanency plan has been approved by the court pursuant to this subsection or subdivision (5) of subsection (j) of this section, the commissioner shall file a motion for review of the permanency plan. Any party seeking to oppose the commissioner's permanency plan, including a relative of a child or youth by blood or marriage who has intervened pursuant to subsection (d) of this section and is licensed as a foster parent for such child or youth or is vested with such child's or youth's temporary custody by order of the court, shall file a motion in opposition not later than thirty days after the filing of the commissioner's motion for review of the permanency plan, which motion shall include the reason therefor. A permanency hearing on any motion for review of the permanency plan shall be held not later than ninety days after the filing of such motion. The court shall hold evidentiary hearings in connection with any contested motion for review of the permanency plan and credible hearsay evidence regarding any party's compliance with specific steps ordered by the court shall be admissible at such evidentiary hearings. The commissioner shall have the burden of proving that the proposed permanency plan is in the best interests of the child or youth. After the initial permanency hearing, subsequent permanency hearings shall be held not less frequently than every twelve months while the child or youth remains in the custody of the Commissioner of Children and Families or, if the youth is over eighteen years of age, while the youth remains in voluntary placement with the department. The court shall provide notice to the child or youth, the parent or guardian of such child or youth, and any intervenor of the time and place of the court hearing on any such motion not less than fourteen days prior to such hearing.\n\n(B) (i) If a child is at least twelve years of age, the child's permanency plan, and any revision to such plan, shall be developed in consultation with the child. In developing or revising such plan, the child may consult up to two individuals participating in the department's case plan regarding such child, neither of whom shall be the foster parent or caseworker of such child. One individual so selected by such child may be designated as the child's advisor for purposes of developing or revising the permanency plan. Regardless of the child's age, the commissioner shall provide not less than five days' advance written notice of any permanency team meeting concerning the child's permanency plan to an attorney or guardian ad litem appointed to represent the child pursuant to subsection (c) of this section.\n\n(ii) If a child is at least twelve years of age, the commissioner shall notify the parent or guardian, foster parent and child of any administrative case review regarding such child's commitment not less than five days prior to such review and shall make a reasonable effort to schedule such review at a time and location that allows the parent or guardian, foster parent and child to attend.\n\n(iii) If a child is at least twelve years of age, such child shall, whenever possible, identify not more than three adults with whom such child has a significant relationship and who may serve as a permanency resource. The identity of such adults shall be recorded in the case plan of such child.\n\n(2) At a permanency hearing held in accordance with the provisions of subdivision (1) of this subsection, the court shall approve a permanency plan that is in the best interests of the child or youth and takes into consideration the child's or youth's need for permanency. The child's or youth's health and safety shall be of paramount concern in formulating such plan. Such permanency plan may include the goal of (A) revocation of commitment and reunification of the child or youth with the parent or guardian, with or without protective supervision; (B) transfer of guardianship or permanent legal guardianship; (C) filing of termination of parental rights and adoption; or (D) for a child sixteen years of age or older, another planned permanent living arrangement ordered by the court, provided the Commissioner of Children and Families has documented a compelling reason why it would not be in the best interests of the child or youth for the permanency plan to include the goals in subparagraphs (A) to (C), inclusive, of this subdivision. Such other planned permanent living arrangement shall, whenever possible, include an adult who has a significant relationship with the child, and who is willing to be a permanency resource, and may include, but not be limited to, placement of a youth in an independent living program or long term foster care with an identified foster parent.\n\n(3) If the permanency plan for a child sixteen years of age or older includes the goal of another planned permanent living arrangement pursuant to subparagraph (D) of subdivision (2) of this subsection or subdivision (3) of subsection (c) of section 17a-111b , the department shall document for the court: (A) The manner and frequency of efforts made by the department to return the child home or to secure placement for the child with a fit and willing relative, legal guardian or adoptive parent; and (B) the steps the department has taken to ensure (i) the child's foster family home or child care institution is following a reasonable and prudent parent standard, as defined in section 17a-114d ; and (ii) the child has regular opportunities to engage in age appropriate and developmentally appropriate activities, as defined in section 17a-114d .\n\n(4) At a permanency hearing held in accordance with the provisions of subdivision (1) of this subsection, the court shall (A) (i) ask the child or youth about his or her desired permanency outcome, or (ii) if the child or youth is unavailable to appear at such hearing, require the attorney for the child or youth to consult with the child or youth regarding the child's or youth's desired permanency outcome and report the same to the court, (B) review the status of the child or youth, (C) review the progress being made to implement the permanency plan, (D) determine a timetable for attaining the permanency plan, (E) determine the services to be provided to the parent if the court approves a permanency plan of reunification and the timetable for such services, and (F) determine whether the commissioner has made reasonable efforts to achieve the permanency plan. The court may revoke commitment if a cause for commitment no longer exists and it is in the best interests of the child or youth.\n\n(5) If the permanency plan for a child sixteen years of age or older includes the goal of another planned permanent living arrangement pursuant to subparagraph (D) of subdivision (2) of this subsection, the court shall (A) (i) ask the child about his or her desired permanency outcome, or (ii) if the child is unavailable to appear at a permanency hearing held in accordance with the provisions of subdivision (1) of this subsection, require the attorney for the child to consult with the child regarding the child's desired permanency outcome and report the same to the court; (B) make a judicial determination that, as of the date of hearing, another planned permanent living arrangement is the best permanency plan for the child; and (C) document the compelling reasons why it is not in the best interest of the child to return home or to be placed with a fit and willing relative, legal guardian or adoptive parent.\n\n(6) If the court approves the permanency plan of adoption: (A) The Commissioner of Children and Families shall file a petition for termination of parental rights not later than sixty days after such approval if such petition has not previously been filed; (B) the commissioner may conduct a thorough adoption assessment and child-specific recruitment; and (C) the court may order that the child be photo-listed within thirty days if the court determines that such photo-listing is in the best interests of the child or youth. As used in this subdivision, “thorough adoption assessment” means conducting and documenting face-to-face interviews with the child or youth, foster care providers and other significant parties and “child specific recruitment” means recruiting an adoptive placement targeted to meet the individual needs of the specific child or youth, including, but not limited to, use of the media, use of photo-listing services and any other in-state or out-of-state resources that may be used to meet the specific needs of the child or youth, unless there are extenuating circumstances that indicate that such efforts are not in the best interests of the child or youth.\n\n(l) The Commissioner of Children and Families shall pay directly to the person or persons furnishing goods or services determined by said commissioner to be necessary for the care and maintenance of such child or youth the reasonable expense thereof, payment to be made at intervals determined by said commissioner; and the Comptroller shall draw his or her order on the Treasurer, from time to time, for such part of the appropriation for care of committed children or youths as may be needed in order to enable the commissioner to make such payments. The commissioner shall include in the department's annual budget a sum estimated to be sufficient to carry out the provisions of this section. Notwithstanding that any such child or youth has income or estate, the commissioner may pay the cost of care and maintenance of such child or youth. The commissioner may bill to and collect from the person in charge of the estate of any child or youth aided under this chapter, or the payee of such child's or youth's income, the total amount expended for care of such child or youth or such portion thereof as any such estate or payee is able to reimburse, provided the commissioner shall not collect from such estate or payee any reimbursement for the cost of care or other expenditures made on behalf of such child or youth from (1) the proceeds of any cause of action received by such child or youth; (2) any lottery proceeds due to such child or youth; (3) any inheritance due to such child or youth; (4) any payment due to such child or youth from a trust other than a trust created pursuant to 42 USC 1396p, as amended from time to time; or (5) the decedent estate of such child or youth.\n\n(m) The commissioner, a parent or the child's attorney may file a motion to revoke a commitment, and, upon finding that cause for commitment no longer exists, and that such revocation is in the best interests of such child or youth, the court may revoke the commitment of such child or youth. No such motion shall be filed more often than once every six months.\n\n(n) If the court has ordered legal guardianship of a child or youth to be vested in a suitable and worthy person pursuant to subsection (j) of this section, the child's or youth's parent or former legal guardian may file a motion to reinstate guardianship of the child or youth in such parent or former legal guardian. Upon the filing of such a motion, the court may order the Commissioner of Children and Families to investigate the home conditions and needs of the child or youth and the home conditions of the person seeking reinstatement of guardianship, and to make a recommendation to the court. A party to a motion for reinstatement of guardianship shall not be entitled to court-appointed counsel or representation by Division of Public Defender Services assigned counsel, except as provided in section 46b-136 . Upon finding that the cause for the removal of guardianship no longer exists, and that reinstatement is in the best interests of the child or youth, the court may reinstate the guardianship of the parent or the former legal guardian. No such motion may be filed more often than once every six months.\n\n(o) Upon service on the parent, guardian or other person having control of the child or youth of any order issued by the court pursuant to the provisions of subsections (b) and (j) of this section, the child or youth concerned shall be surrendered to the person serving the order who shall forthwith deliver the child or youth to the person, agency, department or institution awarded custody in the order. Upon refusal of the parent, guardian or other person having control of the child or youth to surrender the child or youth as provided in the order, the court may cause a warrant to be issued charging the parent, guardian or other person having control of the child or youth with contempt of court. If the person arrested is found in contempt of court, the court may order such person confined until the person complies with the order, but for not more than six months, or may fine such person not more than five hundred dollars, or both.\n\n(p) A foster parent, prospective adoptive parent or relative caregiver shall receive notice and have the right to be heard for the purposes of this section in Superior Court in any proceeding concerning a foster child living with such foster parent, prospective adoptive parent or relative caregiver. A foster parent, prospective adoptive parent or relative caregiver who has cared for a child or youth shall have the right to be heard and comment on the best interests of such child or youth in any proceeding under this section which is brought not more than one year after the last day the foster parent, prospective adoptive parent or relative caregiver provided such care. Any notice provided pursuant to this subsection shall include the Internet web site address for any proceeding that will be conducted on a virtual platform. The court shall confirm compliance with the notice requirements set forth in this subsection at any such proceeding.\n\n(q) Upon motion of any sibling of any child committed to the Department of Children and Families pursuant to this section, such sibling shall have the right to be heard concerning visitation with, and placement of, any such child. In awarding any visitation or modifying any placement, the court shall be guided by the best interests of all siblings affected by such determination.\n\n(r) The provisions of section 17a-152 , regarding placement of a child from another state, and section 17a-175 , regarding the Interstate Compact on the Placement of Children, shall apply to placements pursuant to this section. In any proceeding under this section involving the placement of a child or youth in another state where the provisions of section 17a-175 are applicable, the court shall, before ordering or approving such placement, state for the record the court's finding concerning compliance with the provisions of section 17a-175 . The court's statement shall include, but not be limited to: (1) A finding that the state has received notice in writing from the receiving state, in accordance with subsection (d) of Article III of section 17a-175 , indicating that the proposed placement does not appear contrary to the interests of the child, (2) the court has reviewed such notice, (3) whether or not an interstate compact study or other home study has been completed by the receiving state, and (4) if such a study has been completed, whether the conclusions reached by the receiving state as a result of such study support the placement.\n\n(s) In any proceeding under this section, the Department of Children and Families shall provide notice to (1) each attorney of record for each party involved in the proceeding when the department seeks to transfer a child or youth in its care, custody or control to an out-of-state placement, and (2) the attorney for the child or youth, and any guardian ad litem for such child or youth, of (A) any new report of abuse or neglect pertaining to such child or youth or such child's or youth's parent or guardian received pursuant to section 17a-103a , (B) whether such report resulted in an investigation, and (C) the results of any such investigation.\n\n(t) If a child or youth is placed into out-of-home care by the Commissioner of Children and Families pursuant to this section, the commissioner shall include in any report the commissioner submits to the court information regarding (1) the safety and suitability of such child's or youth's placement, taking into account the requirements set forth in section 17a-114 ; (2) whether the department has received or obtained the most recent information concerning such child's or youth's medical, dental, developmental, educational and treatment needs from any relevant service providers; (3) a timeline for ensuring that such needs are met; (4) for any such child or youth under three years of age, whether the child or youth was screened for developmental and social-emotional delays pursuant to section 17a-106e , whether any such delays were identified and, if so, whether the child or youth was referred to the birth-to-three program pursuant to said section; (5) the dates of administrative case review meetings and permanency team meetings; (6) any new report alleging abuse or neglect pertaining to such child or youth or a parent or guardian of such child or youth pursuant to section 17a-103a , and (A) whether such report resulted in an investigation, and (B) the findings of any such investigation; and (7) any new criminal charges pending against any such parent or guardian. Such information shall also be submitted to the court (A) not later than ninety days after such child or youth is placed into out-of-home care; (B) if such child's or youth's out-of-home placement changes; and (C) if the commissioner files a permanency plan on behalf of such child or youth. The court shall consider such information in making decisions regarding such child's or youth's best interests.\n\n(u) Prior to the issuance of any order affecting the legal status or placement of a child in any proceeding under this section, the court shall confirm that (1) any attorney for such child has obtained a clear understanding of the situation and the needs of such child, as described in 42 USC 5106a(b)(2)(B), as amended from time to time; (2) any guardian ad litem for such child has performed an independent investigation of the case and is prepared to present information pertinent to the court's determination of the best interests of such child, in accordance with the provisions of subparagraph (D) of subdivision (2) of section 46b-129a ; and (3) any attorney or guardian ad litem for such child has (A) communicated regularly with such child, or, in the case of a nonverbal child, such child's caregivers and service providers, and (B) visited with such child with sufficient frequency as to be informed of such child's situation and needs.\n\n(v) In any proceeding to review, modify, terminate or extend an order of protective supervision, the Department of Children and Families shall file with the court information concerning (1) whether the department has received or obtained the most up-to-date information concerning the child's medical, dental, developmental, educational and treatment needs from any relevant service providers; (2) whether the child has received services recommended by any such providers and a description of any concerns identified by such providers; (3) a description of (A) any new report alleging abuse or neglect pertaining to the child or a parent of the child received pursuant to section 17a-103a , (B) whether such report resulted in an investigation, and (C) the findings of any such investigation; (4) any new criminal charges pending against any such parent; and (5) for any child under three years of age, whether the child was screened for developmental and social-emotional delays pursuant to section 17a-106e , whether any such delays were identified and, if so, whether the child was referred to the birth-to-three program pursuant to said section.\n\n(w) In any proceeding under this section, the Department of Children and Families shall identify the source of any documentation, statements or allegations included in the department's submissions to the court and the date or dates upon which any such information was obtained by the department.\n\nSee Sec. 17a-109 re commitment of children to child-caring institutions."

Such judge may admit the child to bail or release the child in the custody of the child's parent or parents, the child's guardian or some other suitable person to appear before the Superior Court when ordered.

If such child is released to the child's own custody, the officer shall make reasonable efforts to notify, and to provide a copy of a written complaint and summons to, the parent or guardian or some other suitable person or agency prior to the court date on the summons.

No child may be detained after such hearing unless the court determines, based on the available facts, that (1) there is probable cause to believe that the child has committed the acts alleged, (2) there is no less restrictive alternative available, and (3) through the use of the detention risk screening instrument developed pursuant to section 46b-133g , that there is (A) probable cause to believe that the level of risk the child poses to public safety if released to the community prior to the court hearing or disposition cannot be managed in a less restrictive setting, (B) a need to hold the child in order to ensure the child's appearance before the court or compliance with court process, as demonstrated by the child's previous failure to respond to the court process, or (C) a need to hold the child for another jurisdiction. Such probable cause may be shown by sworn affidavit in lieu of testimony. No child shall be released from a juvenile residential center who is alleged to have committed a serious juvenile offense except by order of a judge of the Superior Court. The court may, in its discretion, consider as an alternative to detention a suspended detention order with graduated sanctions to be imposed based on the detention risk screening for such child, using the instrument developed pursuant to section 46b-133g . Any child confined in a community correctional center or lockup shall be held in an area separate and apart from any adult detainee, except in the case of a nursing infant, and no child shall at any time be held in solitary confinement. No such child may be held for a period that exceeds six hours, except such child may be held for a period that does not exceed eight hours in a case where an officer has submitted an application for an order of detention and the judge has not yet ruled on such application, or if such officer has been unable to contact such child's parent or guardian. When a female child is held in custody, she shall, as far as possible, be in the charge of a woman attendant.",
              "(f) The police officer who brings a child into detention shall have first notified, or made a reasonable effort to notify, the parents or guardian of the child in question of the intended action and shall file at the juvenile residential center a signed statement setting forth the alleged delinquent conduct of the child and the order to detain such child. Upon admission, the child shall be administered the detention risk screening instrument developed pursuant to section 46b-133g , and unless the child was arrested for a serious juvenile offense or unless an order not to release is noted on the take into custody order, arrest warrant or order to detain, the child may be released to the custody of the child's parent or parents, guardian or some other suitable person or agency in accordance with policies adopted by the Court Support Services Division of the Judicial Department pursuant to section 46b-133h .",
              "(g) In conjunction with any order of release from detention, the court may, when it has reason to believe a child is alcohol-dependent or drug-dependent as defined in section 46b-120 , and where necessary, reasonable and appropriate, order the child to participate in a program of periodic alcohol or drug testing and treatment as a condition of such release. The results of any such alcohol or drug test shall be admissible only for the purposes of enforcing the conditions of release from detention.",
              "(h) The detention supervisor of a juvenile residential center in charge of intake shall admit only a child who: (1) Is the subject of an order to detain or an outstanding court order to take such child into custody, (2) is ordered by a court to be held in detention, or (3) is being transferred to such center to await a court appearance.",
              "(i) Whenever a child is subject to a court order to take such child into custody, or other process issued pursuant to this section or section 46b-140a , the Judicial Branch may cause the order or process to be entered into a central computer system in accordance with policies and procedures established by the Chief Court Administrator. The existence of the order or process in the computer system shall constitute prima facie evidence of the issuance of the order or process. Any child named in the order or process may be arrested or taken into custody based on the existence of the order or process in the computer system and, if the order or process directs that such child be detained, the child shall be held in a juvenile residential center.",
              "(j) In the case of any child held in detention, the order to detain such child shall be for a period that does not exceed seven days or until the dispositional hearing is held, whichever is shorter, unless, following a detention review hearing, such order is renewed for a period that does not exceed seven days or until the dispositional hearing is held, whichever is shorter.",
              "(k) For purposes of subsections (c) and (e) of this section, a child may be determined to pose a risk to public safety if such child has previously been adjudicated as delinquent for or convicted of or pled guilty or nolo contendere to two or more felony offenses, has had two or more prior dispositions of probation and is charged with commission of a larceny under section 53a-119c .",

Whenever a child is arrested and charged with a delinquent act, such child (1) shall be brought before a judge of the Superior Court not later than the fifth business day after such arrest, unless required sooner pursuant to subsection (e) of this section, and (2) may be required to submit to the taking of his photograph, physical description and fingerprints. Notwithstanding the provisions of section 46b-124 , the name, photograph and custody status of any child arrested for the commission of a capital felony under the provisions of section 53a-54b in effect prior to April 25, 2012, or class A felony may be disclosed to the public.\n\n(b) Whenever a child is brought before a judge of the Superior Court, which court shall be the court that has jurisdiction over juvenile matters where the child resides if the residence of such child can be determined, such judge shall immediately have the case proceeded upon as a juvenile matter. Such judge may admit the child to bail or release the child in the custody of the child's parent or parents, the child's guardian or some other suitable person to appear before the Superior Court when ordered. If there is probable cause to believe that the child has committed the acts alleged, the court may consider if the child should be assessed for services. Such assessment shall be held not later than two weeks after the child is arraigned and such child shall have the right to counsel at such assessment. If detention becomes necessary, such detention shall be in the manner prescribed by this chapter, provided the child shall be placed in the least restrictive environment possible in a manner consistent with public safety.\n\n(c) (1) Upon the arrest of any child by an officer, such officer may (A) release the child to the custody of the child's parent or parents, guardian or some other suitable person or agency, (B) at the discretion of the officer, release the child to the child's own custody, or (C) using the form prescribed pursuant to section 46b-133p , seek a court order to detain the child in a juvenile residential center. No child may be placed in a juvenile residential center unless a judge of the Superior Court determines, based on the available facts, that (i) there is probable cause to believe that the child has committed the acts alleged, (ii) detention of the child is more reasonable than an appropriate less restrictive alternative, and (iii) there is (I) probable cause to believe that the level of risk that the child poses to public safety if released to the community prior to the court hearing or disposition cannot be managed in a less restrictive setting, (II) a need to hold the child in order to ensure the child's appearance before the court or compliance with court process, as demonstrated by the child's previous failure to respond to the court process, or (III) a need to hold the child for another jurisdiction. No child shall be held in any juvenile residential center unless an order to detain is issued by a judge of the Superior Court. If any such judge declines to detain a child, such judge shall articulate the reasons in writing, upon the form submitted in accordance with subparagraph (C) of this subdivision, for not holding the child in a juvenile residential center.\n\n(2) A judge of the Superior Court may order any child who is released into the custody of his or her parent or guardian or some other suitable person or agency after being charged with a second or subsequent delinquency offense involving a motor vehicle, as defined in section 46b-133j , or property theft, to be electronically monitored by using a global positioning system device until such child's case is disposed of or earlier upon order of the court. Any failure by the child to adhere to the judge's order concerning electronic monitoring may result in immediate detention of such child.\n\n(d) When a child is arrested for the commission of a delinquent act and the child is not placed in a juvenile residential center or referred to a diversionary program, an officer shall serve a written complaint and summons on the child and the child's parent, guardian or some other suitable person or agency. If such child is released to the child's own custody, the officer shall make reasonable efforts to notify, and to provide a copy of a written complaint and summons to, the parent or guardian or some other suitable person or agency prior to the court date on the summons. If a child is arrested for a firearms offense or a motor vehicle offense, the court date shall be scheduled for the next business day following the date of the child's arrest for such offense. If any person so summoned wilfully fails to appear in court at the time and place so specified, the court may issue a warrant for the child's arrest or a capias to assure the appearance in court of such parent, guardian or other person. If a child wilfully fails to appear in response to such a summons, the court may order such child taken into custody and such child may be charged with the delinquent act of wilful failure to appear under section 46b-120 . The court may punish for contempt, as provided in section 46b-121 , any parent, guardian or other person so summoned who wilfully fails to appear in court at the time and place so specified.\n\n(e) When a child is arrested for the commission of a delinquent act and is placed in a juvenile residential center pursuant to subsection (c) of this section, such child may be detained pending a hearing which shall be held on the business day next following the child's arrest. No child may be detained after such hearing unless the court determines, based on the available facts, that (1) there is probable cause to believe that the child has committed the acts alleged, (2) there is no less restrictive alternative available, and (3) through the use of the detention risk screening instrument developed pursuant to section 46b-133g , that there is (A) probable cause to believe that the level of risk the child poses to public safety if released to the community prior to the court hearing or disposition cannot be managed in a less restrictive setting, (B) a need to hold the child in order to ensure the child's appearance before the court or compliance with court process, as demonstrated by the child's previous failure to respond to the court process, or (C) a need to hold the child for another jurisdiction. Such probable cause may be shown by sworn affidavit in lieu of testimony. No child shall be released from a juvenile residential center who is alleged to have committed a serious juvenile offense except by order of a judge of the Superior Court. The court may, in its discretion, consider as an alternative to detention a suspended detention order with graduated sanctions to be imposed based on the detention risk screening for such child, using the instrument developed pursuant to section 46b-133g . Any child confined in a community correctional center or lockup shall be held in an area separate and apart from any adult detainee, except in the case of a nursing infant, and no child shall at any time be held in solitary confinement. No such child may be held for a period that exceeds six hours, except such child may be held for a period that does not exceed eight hours in a case where an officer has submitted an application for an order of detention and the judge has not yet ruled on such application, or if such officer has been unable to contact such child's parent or guardian. When a female child is held in custody, she shall, as far as possible, be in the charge of a woman attendant.\n\n(f) The police officer who brings a child into detention shall have first notified, or made a reasonable effort to notify, the parents or guardian of the child in question of the intended action and shall file at the juvenile residential center a signed statement setting forth the alleged delinquent conduct of the child and the order to detain such child. Upon admission, the child shall be administered the detention risk screening instrument developed pursuant to section 46b-133g , and unless the child was arrested for a serious juvenile offense or unless an order not to release is noted on the take into custody order, arrest warrant or order to detain, the child may be released to the custody of the child's parent or parents, guardian or some other suitable person or agency in accordance with policies adopted by the Court Support Services Division of the Judicial Department pursuant to section 46b-133h .\n\n(g) In conjunction with any order of release from detention, the court may, when it has reason to believe a child is alcohol-dependent or drug-dependent as defined in section 46b-120 , and where necessary, reasonable and appropriate, order the child to participate in a program of periodic alcohol or drug testing and treatment as a condition of such release.

            "text": "(a) For the purposes of this section, “special juvenile probation” means a period of probation imposed by the superior court for juvenile matters upon a child in a proceeding designated as a serious homicide, firearm or sexual offender prosecution during which the child is supervised by a juvenile probation officer prior to such child attaining eighteen years of age and by an adult probation officer after such child attains eighteen years of age.\n\n(b) Whenever a child is referred for (1) the commission of any crime of (A) murder or manslaughter in the first degree, (B) a violation of section 53a-56a , 53a-60a , 53a-60c , 53a-92a , 53a-94a , 53a-102a , 53a-103a or 53a-212 , or (C) a violation of section 53a-59 , 53a-101 or 53a-136a if such violation involved the use of a firearm, or (2) the commission of any crime of a sexual nature, and such case is not transferred to the regular criminal docket pursuant to section 46b-127 , the prosecutorial official may request the court to designate the proceeding as a serious homicide, firearm or sexual offender prosecution.\n\n(c) If a prosecutorial official requests that a proceeding be designated as a serious homicide, firearm or sexual offender prosecution, the court shall hold a hearing not later than thirty days after the filing of such request unless good cause is shown by the prosecutorial official or by the child as to why the hearing should not be held within such period. If good cause is shown, the hearing shall be held not later than ninety days after the filing of such request. The court shall decide whether to designate the proceeding as a serious homicide, firearm or sexual offender prosecution not later than thirty days after the completion of such hearing. The court shall grant the request to designate the proceeding as a serious homicide, firearm or sexual offender prosecution if the court finds probable cause to believe the child has committed the felony act charged and the prosecutorial official shows by clear and convincing evidence that such designation will serve the public safety. The decision to designate the proceeding as a serious homicide, firearm or sexual offender prosecution shall not be a final judgment for purposes of appeal.\n\n(d) A proceeding designated as a serious homicide, firearm or sexual offender prosecution pursuant to subsection (c) of this section shall be held before the court without a jury provided the child has waived the right to a trial by jury. If a child is convicted of or pleads guilty or nolo contendere to a charge in a proceeding that has been designated as a serious homicide, firearm or sexual offender prosecution, the court shall: (1) Sentence the child in accordance with section 46b-140 , provided such sentence may be extended for a period not to exceed sixty months, (2) sentence the child to a period of special juvenile probation of at least five years, to commence upon the release of the child from the institution, agency or program in whose care the child had been placed, and (3) sentence the child in accordance with section 53a-28 with the execution of such sentence stayed on the condition that the child not violate the conditions of the sentence imposed pursuant to subdivisions (1) and (2) of this subsection or commit a subsequent crime.\n\n(e) Whenever there is probable cause to believe that a child who has been sentenced pursuant to subsection (d) of this section has violated the conditions of the sentence imposed pursuant to subdivision (2) of said subsection or has committed a subsequent crime, the court may issue a warrant for the arrest of the child for a violation of the conditions of the sentence imposed pursuant to subsection (d) of this section and may order that the child be taken into custody in accordance with the provisions of sections 46b-125 and 53a-32 . If such violation of probation or subsequent crime occurs prior to the person attaining eighteen years of age, the matter shall be handled by the superior court for juvenile matters. If such violation of probation or subsequent crime occurs after the person has attained eighteen years of age, the matter shall be handled by the regular criminal docket of the Superior Court. Whenever such matter is handled by the superior court for juvenile matters, the court shall notify the child and such child's parent or guardian and the attorney of record, if any, in writing of the reasons alleged to exist for the lifting of the stay of execution of the sentence imposed pursuant to subdivision (3) of subsection (d) of this section. If the child challenges such reasons, the court shall hold a hearing at which the child shall be entitled to be heard and be represented by counsel. After such hearing, if the court finds that (1) the child has violated the conditions of the sentence imposed pursuant to subdivision (2) of subsection (d) of this section, (2) committed a subsequent crime, or (3) by clear and convincing evidence that the best interest of the community cannot be served by continued supervision by the superior court for juvenile matters or in the community, it shall order the child to serve a sentence not to exceed that imposed pursuant to subdivision (3) of subsection (d) of this section unless it determines there are mitigating circumstances that justify continuing the stay of execution and specifically states such mitigating circumstances in writing for the record. The child shall receive credit against any sentence imposed pursuant to subdivision (3) of subsection (d) of this section for time served in a juvenile facility pursuant to the sentence imposed pursuant to subdivision (1) of said subsection.\n\n(f) When a proceeding has been designated as a serious homicide, firearm or sexual offender prosecution pursuant to subsection (c) of this section and the child does not waive the right to a trial by jury, the court shall transfer the case from the docket for juvenile matters to the regular criminal docket of the Superior Court. Upon transfer, such child shall stand trial and be sentenced, if convicted, as if such child were eighteen years of age, subject to the provisions of section 54-91g , except that no such child shall be placed in a correctional facility but shall be maintained in a facility for children and youths until such child attains eighteen years of age or until such child is sentenced, whichever occurs first. Such child shall receive credit against any sentence imposed for time served in a juvenile facility prior to the effectuation of the transfer. A child who has been transferred may enter a guilty plea to a lesser offense if the court finds that such plea is made knowingly and voluntarily. Any child transferred to the regular criminal docket who pleads guilty to a lesser offense shall not resume such child's status as a juvenile regarding such offense. If the action is dismissed or nolled or if such child is found not guilty of the charge for which such child was transferred, the child shall resume such child's status as a juvenile until such child attains eighteen years of age."

The Court Support Services Division shall provide written notice concerning the erasure of certain records to any such child and the child's parent or guardian when (1) such child is so discharged, and (2) upon such child's eighteenth birthday if such child was younger than eighteen years of age when so discharged. Such notice shall provide that such child, parent or guardian may petition the Superior Court for such erasure pursuant to this section. If, upon the filing of such petition, such court finds (A) (i) that at least two years or, in the case of a child convicted as delinquent for the commission of a serious juvenile offense, four years have elapsed from the date of such discharge, (ii) that no subsequent juvenile proceeding or adult criminal proceeding is pending against such child, (iii) that such child has not been convicted of a delinquent act that would constitute a felony or misdemeanor if committed by an adult during such two-year or four-year period, (iv) that such child has not been convicted as an adult of a felony or misdemeanor during such two-year or four-year period, and (v) that such child has reached eighteen years of age, or (B) that such child has a criminal record as a result of being a victim of conduct by another person that constitutes a violation of section 53a-192a or a criminal violation of 18 USC Chapter 77, the court shall order all police and court records pertaining to such child to be erased. Upon the entry of such an erasure order, all references including arrest, complaint, referrals, petitions, reports and orders, shall be removed from all agency, official and institutional files, and a finding of delinquency or that the child was a member of a family with service needs shall be deemed never to have occurred. The persons in charge of such records shall not disclose to any person information pertaining to the record so erased, except that the fact of such erasure may be substantiated where, in the opinion of the court, it is in the best interests of such child to do so. No child who has been the subject of such an erasure order shall be deemed to have been arrested ab initio, within the meaning of the general statutes, with respect to proceedings so erased. Copies of the erasure order shall be sent to all persons, agencies, officials or institutions known to have information pertaining to the delinquency or family with service needs proceedings affecting such child. Whenever a child is dismissed as not delinquent or as not being a member of a family with service needs, all police and court records pertaining to such charge shall be ordered erased immediately, without the filing of a petition. Nothing in this section shall prohibit the court from granting a petition to erase a child's records on a showing of good cause, after a hearing, before the time when such records could be erased."

The Court Support Services Division shall provide written notice concerning the erasure of certain records to any such child and the child's parent or guardian when (1) such child is so discharged, and (2) upon such child's eighteenth birthday if such child was younger than eighteen years of age when so discharged. Such notice shall provide that such child, parent or guardian may petition the Superior Court for such erasure pursuant to this section. If, upon the filing of such petition, such court finds (A) (i) that at least two years or, in the case of a child convicted as delinquent for the commission of a serious juvenile offense, four years have elapsed from the date of such discharge, (ii) that no subsequent juvenile proceeding or adult criminal proceeding is pending against such child, (iii) that such child has not been convicted of a delinquent act that would constitute a felony or misdemeanor if committed by an adult during such two-year or four-year period, (iv) that such child has not been convicted as an adult of a felony or misdemeanor during such two-year or four-year period, and (v) that such child has reached eighteen years of age, or (B) that such child has a criminal record as a result of being a victim of conduct by another person that constitutes a violation of section 53a-192a or a criminal violation of 18 USC Chapter 77, the court shall order all police and court records pertaining to such child to be erased. Upon the entry of such an erasure order, all references including arrest, complaint, referrals, petitions, reports and orders, shall be removed from all agency, official and institutional files, and a finding of delinquency or that the child was a member of a family with service needs shall be deemed never to have occurred. The persons in charge of such records shall not disclose to any person information pertaining to the record so erased, except that the fact of such erasure may be substantiated where, in the opinion of the court, it is in the best interests of such child to do so. No child who has been the subject of such an erasure order shall be deemed to have been arrested ab initio, within the meaning of the general statutes, with respect to proceedings so erased. Copies of the erasure order shall be sent to all persons, agencies, officials or institutions known to have information pertaining to the delinquency or family with service needs proceedings affecting such child. Whenever a child is dismissed as not delinquent or as not being a member of a family with service needs, all police and court records pertaining to such charge shall be ordered erased immediately, without the filing of a petition.

              "PURPOSE",
              "The compacting states to this Interstate Compact recognize that each state is responsible for the proper supervision or return of juveniles, delinquents and status offenders who are on probation or parole and who have absconded, escaped or run away from supervision and control and in so doing have endangered their own safety and the safety of others. The compacting states also recognize that each state is responsible for the safe return of juveniles who have run away from home and in doing so have left their state of residence. The compacting states also recognize that Congress, by enacting the Crime Control Act, 4 USC Section 112 (1965), has authorized and encouraged compacts for cooperative efforts and mutual assistance in the prevention of crime.",
              "It is the purpose of this compact, through means of joint and cooperative action among the compacting states to: (A) Ensure that the adjudicated juveniles and status offenders subject to this compact are provided adequate supervision and services in the receiving state as ordered by the adjudicating judge or parole authority in the sending state; (B) ensure that the public safety interests of the citizens, including the victims of juvenile offenders, in both the sending and receiving states are adequately protected; (C) return juveniles who have run away, absconded or escaped from supervision or control or have been accused of an offense to the state requesting their return; (D) make contracts for the cooperative institutionalization in public facilities in member states for delinquent youth needing special services; (E) provide for the effective tracking and supervision of juveniles; (F) equitably allocate the costs, benefits and obligations of the compacting states; (G) establish procedures to manage the movement between states of juvenile offenders released to the community under the jurisdiction of courts, juvenile departments, or any other criminal or juvenile justice agency which has jurisdiction over juvenile offenders; (H) ensure immediate notice to jurisdictions where defined offenders are authorized to travel or to relocate across state lines; (I) establish procedures to resolve pending charges (detainers) against juvenile offenders prior to transfer or release to the community under the terms of this compact; (J) establish a system of uniform data collection on information pertaining to juveniles subject to this compact that allows access by authorized juvenile justice and criminal justice officials, and regular reporting of compact activities to heads of state executive, judicial and legislative branches and juvenile and criminal justice administrators; (K) monitor compliance with rules governing interstate movement of juveniles and initiate interventions to address and correct noncompliance; (L) coordinate training and education regarding the regulation of interstate movement of juveniles for officials involved in such activity; and (M) coordinate the implementation and operation of the compact with the Interstate Compact for the Placement of Children, the Interstate Compact for Adult Offender Supervision and other compacts affecting juveniles particularly in those cases where concurrent or overlapping supervision issues arise. It is the policy of the compacting states that the activities conducted by the Interstate Commission created herein are the formation of public policies and therefore are public business. Furthermore, the compacting states shall cooperate and observe their individual and collective duties and responsibilities for the prompt return and acceptance of juveniles subject to the provisions of this compact.

The compacting states also recognize that each state is responsible for the safe return of juveniles who have run away from home and in doing so have left their state of residence. The compacting states also recognize that Congress, by enacting the Crime Control Act, 4 USC Section 112 (1965), has authorized and encouraged compacts for cooperative efforts and mutual assistance in the prevention of crime.\n\nIt is the purpose of this compact, through means of joint and cooperative action among the compacting states to: (A) Ensure that the adjudicated juveniles and status offenders subject to this compact are provided adequate supervision and services in the receiving state as ordered by the adjudicating judge or parole authority in the sending state; (B) ensure that the public safety interests of the citizens, including the victims of juvenile offenders, in both the sending and receiving states are adequately protected; (C) return juveniles who have run away, absconded or escaped from supervision or control or have been accused of an offense to the state requesting their return; (D) make contracts for the cooperative institutionalization in public facilities in member states for delinquent youth needing special services; (E) provide for the effective tracking and supervision of juveniles; (F) equitably allocate the costs, benefits and obligations of the compacting states; (G) establish procedures to manage the movement between states of juvenile offenders released to the community under the jurisdiction of courts, juvenile departments, or any other criminal or juvenile justice agency which has jurisdiction over juvenile offenders; (H) ensure immediate notice to jurisdictions where defined offenders are authorized to travel or to relocate across state lines; (I) establish procedures to resolve pending charges (detainers) against juvenile offenders prior to transfer or release to the community under the terms of this compact; (J) establish a system of uniform data collection on information pertaining to juveniles subject to this compact that allows access by authorized juvenile justice and criminal justice officials, and regular reporting of compact activities to heads of state executive, judicial and legislative branches and juvenile and criminal justice administrators; (K) monitor compliance with rules governing interstate movement of juveniles and initiate interventions to address and correct noncompliance; (L) coordinate training and education regarding the regulation of interstate movement of juveniles for officials involved in such activity; and (M) coordinate the implementation and operation of the compact with the Interstate Compact for the Placement of Children, the Interstate Compact for Adult Offender Supervision and other compacts affecting juveniles particularly in those cases where concurrent or overlapping supervision issues arise. It is the policy of the compacting states that the activities conducted by the Interstate Commission created herein are the formation of public policies and therefore are public business. Furthermore, the compacting states shall cooperate and observe their individual and collective duties and responsibilities for the prompt return and acceptance of juveniles subject to the provisions of this compact. The provisions of this compact shall be reasonably and liberally construed to accomplish the purposes and policies of the compact.\n\nARTICLE II\n\nDEFINITIONS\n\nAs used in this compact, unless the context clearly requires a different construction:\n\nA. “Bylaws” means those bylaws established by the Interstate Commission for its governance, or for directing or controlling its actions or conduct.\n\nB. “Compact administrator” means the individual in each compacting state appointed pursuant to the terms of this compact, responsible for the administration and management of the state's supervision and transfer of juveniles subject to the terms of this compact, the rules adopted by the Interstate Commission and policies adopted by the State Council under this compact.\n\nC. “Compacting state” means any state which has enacted the enabling legislation for this compact.\n\nD. “Commissioner” means the voting representative of each compacting state appointed pursuant to Article III of this compact.\n\nE. “Court” means any court having jurisdiction over delinquent, neglected or dependent children.\n\nF. “Deputy compact administrator” means the individual, if any, in each compacting state appointed to act on behalf of a compact administrator pursuant to the terms of this compact responsible for the administration and management of the state's supervision and transfer of juveniles subject to the terms of this compact, the rules adopted by the Interstate Commission and policies adopted by the State Council under this compact.\n\nG. “Interstate Commission” means the Interstate Commission for Juveniles created by Article III of this compact.\n\nH. “Juvenile” means any person defined as a juvenile in any compacting state or by the rules of the Interstate Commission, including:\n\n(1) Accused Delinquent: A person charged with an offense that, if committed by an adult, would be a criminal offense;\n\n(2) Adjudicated Delinquent: A person found to have committed an offense that, if committed by an adult, would be a criminal offense;\n\n(3) Accused Status Offender: A person charged with an offense that would not be a criminal offense if committed by an adult;\n\n(4) Adjudicated Status Offender: A person found to have committed an offense that would not be a criminal offense if committed by an adult; and\n\n(5) Non-Offender: A person in need of supervision who has not been accused or adjudicated a status offender or delinquent.\n\nI. “Non-compacting state” means any state which has not enacted the enabling legislation for this compact.\n\nJ. “Probation or parole” means any kind of supervision or conditional release of juveniles authorized under the laws of the compacting states.\n\nK. “Rule” means a written statement by the Interstate Commission promulgated pursuant to Article VI of this compact that is of general applicability and implements, interprets or prescribes a policy or provision of the compact, or an organizational, procedural or practice requirement of the Interstate Commission, and has the force and effect of statutory law in a compacting state, and includes the amendment, repeal or suspension of an existing rule.\n\nL. “State” means a state of the United States, the District of Columbia or its designee, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the United States Virgin Islands, Guam, American Samoa and the Northern Marianas Islands.\n\nARTICLE III\n\nINTERSTATE COMMISSION FOR JUVENILES\n\nA.

If a majority of the legislatures of the compacting states rejects a rule, those states may, by enactment of a statute or resolution in the same manner used to adopt the compact, cause that such rule shall have no further force and effect in any compacting state.\n\nF. The existing rules governing the operation of the Interstate Compact on Juveniles superseded by this compact shall be null and void twelve months after the first meeting of the Interstate Commission.\n\nG. Upon determination by the Interstate Commission that a state-of-emergency exists, it may promulgate an emergency rule which shall become effective immediately upon adoption, provided that the usual rulemaking procedures provided in this article are retroactively applied to the emergency rule as soon as reasonably possible, but no later than ninety days after the effective date of the emergency rule.\n\nARTICLE VII\n\nOVERSIGHT, ENFORCEMENT AND DISPUTE RESOLUTION BY THE INTERSTATE COMMISSION\n\nSection A. Oversight\n\n1. The Interstate Commission shall oversee the administration and operations of the interstate movement of juveniles subject to this compact in the compacting states and shall monitor such activities being administered in non-compacting states which may significantly affect compacting states.\n\n2. The courts and executive agencies in each compacting state shall enforce this compact and shall take all actions necessary and appropriate to effectuate the compact's purposes and intent. The provisions of this compact and the rules promulgated under this compact shall be received by all the judges, public officers, commissions and departments of the state government as evidence of the authorized statute and administrative rules. All courts shall take judicial notice of the compact and the rules. In any judicial or administrative proceeding in a compacting state pertaining to the subject matter of this compact which may affect the powers, responsibilities or actions of the Interstate Commission, the Interstate Commission is entitled to receive all service of process in any such proceeding, and has standing to intervene in the proceeding for all purposes.\n\nSection B. Dispute Resolution\n\n1. The compacting states shall report to the Interstate Commission on all issues and activities necessary for the administration of the compact as well as issues and activities pertaining to compliance with the provisions of the compact and the bylaws and rules of the Interstate Commission.\n\n2. The Interstate Commission shall attempt, upon the request of a compacting state, to resolve any disputes or other issues which are subject to the compact and which may arise among compacting states and between compacting and non-compacting states. The Interstate Commission shall promulgate a rule providing for both mediation and binding dispute resolution for disputes among the compacting states.\n\n3. The Interstate Commission, in the reasonable exercise of its discretion, shall enforce the provisions and rules of this compact using any or all means set forth in Article XI of this compact.\n\nARTICLE VIII\n\nFINANCE\n\nA. The Interstate Commission shall pay or provide for the payment of the reasonable expenses of its establishment, organization and ongoing activities.\n\nB. The Interstate Commission shall levy on and collect an annual assessment from each compacting state to cover the cost of the internal operations and activities of the Interstate Commission and its staff which must be in a total amount sufficient to cover the Interstate Commission's annual budget as approved each year. The aggregate annual assessment amount shall be allocated based upon a formula to be determined by the Interstate Commission, taking into consideration the population of each compacting state and the volume of interstate movement of juveniles in each compacting state and the Interstate Commission shall promulgate a rule binding upon all compacting states which governs said assessment.\n\nC. The Interstate Commission shall not incur any obligations of any kind prior to securing the funds adequate to meet such obligations; nor shall the Interstate Commission pledge the credit of any of the compacting states, except by and with the authority of the compacting state.\n\nD. The Interstate Commission shall keep accurate accounts of all receipts and disbursements. The receipts and disbursements of the Interstate Commission shall be subject to the audit and accounting procedures established under its bylaws. However, all receipts and disbursements of funds handled by the Interstate Commission shall be audited yearly by a certified or licensed public accountant and the report of the audit shall be included in and become part of the annual report of the Interstate Commission.\n\nARTICLE IX\n\nTHE STATE COUNCIL\n\nEach compacting state shall create a State Council for Interstate Juvenile Supervision. While each state may determine the membership of its own state council, the membership of a state council shall include at least one representative from the legislative, judicial and executive branches of government; victims groups; and the compact administrator, deputy compact administrator or designee. Each compacting state retains the right to determine the qualifications of the compact administrator or deputy compact administrator. Each state council shall advise and may exercise oversight and advocacy concerning that state's participation in Interstate Commission activities and other duties as may be determined by that state including, but not limited to, development of policy concerning operations and procedures of the compact within that state.\n\nARTICLE X\n\nCOMPACTING STATES, EFFECTIVE DATE AND AMENDMENT\n\nA. Any state is eligible to become a compacting state.\n\nB. The compact shall become effective and binding upon legislative enactment of the compact into law by not less than thirty-five states. The initial effective date shall be the later of July 1, 2004, or upon enactment into law by the thirty-fifth state. Thereafter the compact shall become effective and binding as to any other compacting state upon enactment of the compact into law by that state. The governors of non-compacting states or their designees shall be invited to participate in the activities of the Interstate Commission on a non-voting basis prior to adoption of the compact by all states.\n\nC. The Interstate Commission may propose amendments to the compact for enactment by the compacting states. No amendment shall become effective and binding upon the Interstate Commission and the compacting states until it is enacted into law by unanimous consent of the compacting states.\n\nARTICLE XI\n\nWITHDRAWAL, DEFAULT, TERMINATION AND JUDICIAL ENFORCEMENT\n\nSection A. Withdrawal\n\n1. Once effective, the compact shall continue in force and remain binding upon each compacting state. A compacting state may withdraw from the compact by specifically repealing the statute which enacted the compact into law.\n\n2. The effective date of withdrawal is the effective date of the repeal.\n\n3. The withdrawing state shall immediately notify the chairperson of the Interstate Commission in writing upon the introduction of legislation repealing this compact in the withdrawing state. The Interstate Commission shall notify the other compacting states of the withdrawing state's intent to withdraw within sixty days of its receipt thereof.\n\n4. The withdrawing state is responsible for all assessments, obligations and liabilities incurred through the effective date of withdrawal, including any obligations, the performance of which extend beyond the effective date of withdrawal.\n\n5. Reinstatement following withdrawal of any compacting state shall occur upon the withdrawing state reenacting the compact or upon such later date as determined by the Interstate Commission.\n\nSection B. Technical Assistance, Fines, Suspension, Termination and Default\n\n1. If the Interstate Commission determines that any compacting state has at any time defaulted in the performance of any of its obligations or responsibilities under this compact, or the bylaws or rules of the Interstate Commission, the Interstate Commission may impose any or all of the following penalties:\n\na. Remedial training and technical assistance as directed by the Interstate Commission;\n\nb. Alternative Dispute Resolution;\n\nc. Fines, fees and costs in such amounts as are deemed to be reasonable as fixed by the Interstate Commission; and\n\nd. Suspension or termination of membership in the compact, which shall be imposed only after all other reasonable means of securing compliance under the bylaws and rules have been exhausted and the Interstate Commission has determined that the offending state is in default. Immediate notice of suspension shall be given by the Interstate Commission to the Governor, the Chief Justice or the chief judicial officer, the majority and minority leaders of the legislature and the state council of the defaulting state. The grounds for default include, but are not limited to, failure of a compacting state to perform such obligations or responsibilities imposed upon it by this compact, the bylaws, or rules and any other grounds designated in the bylaws and rules of the Interstate Commission. The Interstate Commission shall immediately notify the defaulting state in writing of the penalty imposed by the Interstate Commission and of the default pending a cure of the default. The Interstate Commission shall stipulate the conditions and the time period within which the defaulting state must cure its default. If the defaulting state fails to cure the default within the time period specified by the Interstate Commission, the defaulting state shall be terminated from the compact upon an affirmative vote of a majority of the compacting states and all rights, privileges and benefits conferred by this compact shall be terminated from the effective date of termination.\n\n2. Within sixty days of the effective date of termination of a defaulting state, the Interstate Commission shall notify the Governor, the Chief Justice or chief judicial officer, the majority and minority leaders of the legislature and the state council of the defaulting state of such termination.\n\n3. The defaulting state is responsible for all assessments, obligations and liabilities incurred through the effective date of termination including any obligations, the performance of which extends beyond the effective date of termination.\n\n4. The Interstate Commission shall not bear any costs relating to the defaulting state unless otherwise mutually agreed upon in writing between the Interstate Commission and the defaulting state.\n\n5. Reinstatement following termination of any compacting state requires both a reenactment of the compact by the defaulting state and the approval of the Interstate Commission pursuant to the rules.\n\nSection C. Judicial Enforcement\n\nThe Interstate Commission may, by majority vote of the members, initiate legal action in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia or, at the discretion of the Interstate Commission, for the federal district where the Interstate Commission has its offices, to enforce compliance with the provisions of the compact and the rules and bylaws of the Interstate Commission, against any compacting state in default. In the event judicial enforcement is necessary, the prevailing party shall be awarded all costs of such litigation including reasonable attorney's fees.\n\nSection D. Dissolution of Compact\n\n1. The compact dissolves effective upon the date of the withdrawal or default of the compacting state that reduces membership in the compact to one compacting state.\n\n2. Upon the dissolution of this compact, the compact becomes void and shall be of no further force or effect, and the business and affairs of the Interstate Commission shall be concluded and any surplus funds shall be distributed in accordance with the bylaws.\n\nARTICLE XII\n\nSEVERABILITY AND CONSTRUCTION\n\nA. The provisions of this compact shall be severable, and if any phrase, clause, sentence or provision is deemed unenforceable, the remaining provisions of the compact shall be enforceable.\n\nB. The provisions of this compact shall be liberally construed to effectuate its purposes.\n\nARTICLE XIII\n\nBINDING EFFECT OF COMPACT AND OTHER LAWS\n\nSection A. Other Laws\n\n1. This compact does not prevent the enforcement of any other law of a compacting state that is not inconsistent with this compact.\n\n2. All compacting states' laws other than state constitutions and other interstate compacts conflicting with this compact are superseded to the extent of the conflict.\n\nSection B. Binding Effect of the Compact\n\n1. All lawful actions of the Interstate Commission, including all rules and bylaws promulgated by the Interstate Commission, are binding upon the compacting states.\n\n2. All agreements between the Interstate Commission and the compacting states are binding in accordance with their terms.\n\n3. Upon the request of a party to a conflict over meaning or interpretation of Interstate Commission actions, and upon a majority vote of the compacting states, the Interstate Commission may issue advisory opinions regarding such meaning or interpretation.\n\n4. If any provision of this compact exceeds the constitutional limits imposed on the legislature of any compacting state, the obligations, duties, powers or jurisdiction sought to be conferred by such provision upon the Interstate Commission shall be ineffective and such obligations, duties, powers or jurisdiction shall remain in the compacting state and shall be exercised by the agency of the compacting state to which such obligations, duties, powers or jurisdiction are delegated by law in effect at the time this compact becomes effective."

              "(a)(1) The Superior Court or a family support magistrate may make and enforce orders for payment of support against any person who neglects or refuses to furnish necessary support to such person's spouse or a child under the age of eighteen or as otherwise provided in this subsection, according to such person's ability to furnish such support, notwithstanding the provisions of section 46b-37 . If such child is unmarried and a full-time high school student, such support shall continue according to the parents' respective abilities, if such child is in need of support, until such child completes the twelfth grade or attains the age of nineteen, whichever occurs first.",
              "(2) Any such support order in a IV-D support case shall include a provision for the health care coverage of the child. Such provision may include an order for either parent or both parents to provide such coverage under any or all of subparagraphs (A), (B) or (C) of this subdivision.",
              "(A) The provision for health care coverage may include an order for either parent to name any child as a beneficiary of any medical or dental insurance or benefit plan carried by such parent or available to such parent at a reasonable cost, as defined in subparagraph (D) of this subdivision. If such order requires the parent to maintain insurance available through an employer, the order shall be enforced using a National Medical Support Notice as provided in section 46b-88 .",
              "(B) The provision for health care coverage may include an order for either parent to: (i) Apply for and maintain coverage on behalf of the child under the HUSKY Plan, Part B; or (ii) provide cash medical support, as described in subparagraphs (E) and (F) of this subdivision. An order under this subparagraph shall be made only if the cost to the parent obligated to maintain coverage under the HUSKY Plan, Part B, or provide cash medical support is reasonable, as defined in subparagraph (D) of this subdivision. An order under clause (i) of this subparagraph shall be made only if insurance coverage as described in subparagraph (A) of this subdivision is unavailable at reasonable cost to either parent, or inaccessible to the child.",
              "(C) An order for payment of the child's medical and dental expenses, other than those described in clause (ii) of subparagraph (E) of this subdivision, that are not covered by insurance or reimbursed in any other manner shall be entered in accordance with the child support guidelines established pursuant to section 46b-215a .",
              "(D) Health care coverage shall be deemed reasonable in cost if: (i) The parent obligated to maintain such coverage would qualify as a low-income obligor under the child support guidelines established pursuant to section 46b-215a , based solely on such parent's income, and the cost does not exceed five per cent of such parent's net income; or (ii) the parent obligated to maintain such coverage would not qualify as a low-income obligor under such guidelines and the cost does not exceed seven and one-half per cent of such parent's net income. In either case, net income shall be determined in accordance with the child support guidelines established pursuant to section 46b-215a . If a parent obligated to maintain insurance must obtain coverage for himself or herself to comply with the order to provide coverage for the child, reasonable cost shall be determined based on the combined cost of coverage for such parent and such child.",
              "(E) Cash medical support means (i) an amount ordered to be paid toward the cost of premiums for health insurance coverage provided by a public entity, including the HUSKY Plan, Part A or Part B, except as provided in subparagraph (F) of this subdivision, or by another parent through employment or otherwise, or (ii) an amount ordered to be paid, either directly to a medical provider or to the person obligated to pay such provider, toward any ongoing extraordinary medical and dental expenses of the child that are not covered by insurance or reimbursed in any other manner, provided such expenses are documented and identified (I) specifically on the record, or (II) in an affidavit, made under oath, that also states that no restraining order issued pursuant to section 46b-15 or protective order issued pursuant to section 46b-38c , between the parties is in effect or pending before the court. Cash medical support, as described in clauses (i) and (ii) of this subparagraph, may be ordered in lieu of an order under subparagraph (A) of this subdivision to be effective until such time as health insurance that is accessible to the child and reasonable in cost becomes available, or in addition to an order under subparagraph (A) of this subdivision, provided the total cost to the obligated parent of insurance and cash medical support is reasonable, as described in subparagraph (D) of this subdivision. An order for cash medical support shall be payable to the state or the custodial party, as their interests may appear, provided an order under clause (i) of this subparagraph shall be effective only as long as health insurance coverage is maintained. Any unreimbursed medical and dental expenses not covered by an order issued pursuant to clause (ii) of this subparagraph are subject to an order for unreimbursed medical and dental expenses pursuant to subparagraph (C) of this subdivision.",
              "(F) Cash medical support to offset the cost of any insurance payable under the HUSKY Plan, Part A or Part B, shall not be ordered against a noncustodial parent who is a low-income obligor, as defined in the child support guidelines established pursuant to section 46b-215a , or against a custodial parent of children covered under the HUSKY Plan, Part A or Part B.",
              "(3) Proceedings to obtain orders of support under this section shall be commenced by the service on the liable person or persons of a verified petition, with summons and order, of the husband or wife, child or any relative or the conservator, guardian or support enforcement officer, town or state, or any selectmen or the public official charged with the administration of public assistance of the town, or in IV-D support cases, as defined in subdivision (13) of subsection (b) of section 46b-231 , the Commissioner of Social Services. The verified petition, summons and order shall be filed in the judicial district in which the petitioner or respondent resides or does business, or if filed in the Family Support Magistrate Division, in the judicial district in which the petitioner or respondent resides or does business.",
              "(4) For purposes of this section, the term “child” shall include one born to parents married to each other whose alleged genetic parent has acknowledged in writing parentage of such child or has been adjudged the parent by a court of competent jurisdiction, or a child who was born before marriage whose parents afterwards intermarry.",
              "(5) Said court or family support magistrate shall also have authority to make and enforce orders directed to the conservator or guardian of any person, or payee of Social Security or other benefits to which such person is entitled, to the extent of the income or estate held by such fiduciary or payee in any such capacity.",
              "(6) Said court or family support magistrate shall also have authority to determine, order and enforce payment of any sums due under a written agreement to support against the person liable for such support under such agreement.",
              "(7) (A) The court or family support magistrate may also determine, order and enforce payment of any support due because of neglect or refusal to furnish support for periods prior to the action. In the case of a child born out of wedlock whose parents have not intermarried, a parent's liability for such support shall be limited to the three years next preceding the filing of a petition or written agreement to support pursuant to this section.",
              "(B) In the determination of support due based on neglect or refusal to furnish support prior to the action, the support due for periods of time prior to the action shall be based upon the obligor's ability to pay during such prior periods, as determined in accordance with the child support guidelines established pursuant to section 46b-215a . The state shall disclose to the court any information in its possession concerning current and past ability to pay. If no information is available to the court concerning past ability to pay, the court may determine the support due for periods of time prior to the action as if past ability to pay is equal to current ability to pay, if current ability is known. If current ability to pay is not known, the court shall determine the past ability to pay based on the obligor's work history, if known, or if not known, on the state minimum wage that was in effect during such periods, provided only actual earnings shall be used to determine ability to pay for past periods during which the obligor was a full-time high school student or was incarcerated, institutionalized or incapacitated.",
              "(C) Any finding of support due for periods of time prior to an action in which the obligor failed to appear shall be entered subject to adjustment. Such adjustment may be made upon motion of any party, and the state in IV-D cases shall make such motion if it obtains information that would have substantially affected the court's determination of past ability to pay if such information had been available to the court. Motion for adjustment under this subparagraph may be made not later than twelve months from the date upon which the obligor receives notification of (i) the amount of such finding of support due for periods of time prior to the action, and (ii) the right not later than twelve months from the date of receipt of such notification to present evidence as to such obligor's past ability to pay support for such periods of time prior to the action. A copy of any support order entered, subject to adjustment, shall state in plain language the basis for the court's determination of past support, the right to request an adjustment and to present information concerning the obligor's past ability to pay, and the consequences of a failure to request such adjustment.",
              "(8) (A) The judge or family support magistrate shall cause a summons, signed by such judge or magistrate, by the clerk of said court or Family Support Magistrate Division, or by a commissioner of the Superior Court to be issued requiring such liable person or persons to appear in court or before a family support magistrate, at a time and place as determined by the clerk but not more than ninety days after the issuance of the summons. Service may be made by a state marshal, any proper officer or any investigator employed by the Department of Social Services or by the Commissioner of Administrative Services. The state marshal, proper officer or investigator shall make due return of process to the court not less than twenty-one days before the date assigned for hearing. Upon proof of the service of the summons to appear in court or before a family support magistrate at the time and place named for hearing upon such petition, the failure of the defendant or defendants to appear shall not prohibit the court or family support magistrate from going forward with the hearing. If the summons and order is signed by a commissioner of the Superior Court, upon proof of service of the summons to appear in court or before a family support magistrate and upon the failure of the defendant to appear at the time and place named for hearing upon the petition, request may be made by the petitioner to the court or family support magistrate for an order that a capias mittimus be issued.",
              "(B) In the case of a person supported wholly or in part by a town, the welfare authority of the town shall notify the responsible relatives of such person of the amount of assistance given, the beginning date thereof and the amount of support expected from each of them, if any, and if any such relative does not contribute in such expected amount, the superior court for the judicial district in which such town is located or a family support magistrate sitting in the judicial district in which such town is located may order such relative or relatives to contribute to such support, from the time of the beginning date of expense shown on the notice, such sum as said court or family support magistrate deems reasonably within each such relative's ability to support such person.",
              "(C) The court, or any judge thereof, or family support magistrate when said court or family support magistrate is not sitting, may require the defendant or defendants to become bound, with sufficient surety, to the state, town or person bringing the complaint, to abide such judgment as may be rendered on such complaint. Failure of the defendant or defendants to obey any order made under this section may be punished as contempt of court and the costs of commitment of any person imprisoned for contempt shall be paid by the state as in criminal cases. Except as otherwise provided, upon proof of the service of the summons to appear in court or before a family support magistrate at the time and place named for a hearing upon the failure of the defendant or defendants to obey such court order or order of the family support magistrate, the court or family support magistrate may order a capias mittimus be issued and directed to a judicial marshal to the extent authorized pursuant to section 46b-225 , or any other proper officer to arrest such defendant or defendants and bring such defendant or defendants before the Superior Court for the contempt hearing. When any person is found in contempt under this section, the court or family support magistrate may award to the petitioner a reasonable attorney's fee and the fees of the officer serving the contempt citation, such sums to be paid by the person found in contempt.",
              "(9) In addition to or in lieu of such contempt proceedings, the court or family support magistrate, upon a finding that any person has failed to obey any order made under this section, may: (A) Order a plan for payment of any past-due support owing under such order, or, in IV-D cases, if such obligor is not incapacitated, order such obligor to participate in work activities which may include, but shall not be limited to, job search, training, work experience and participation in the job training and retraining program established by the Labor Commissioner pursuant to section 31-3t ; (B) suspend any professional, occupational, recreational, commercial driver's or motor vehicle operator's license as provided in subsections (b) to (e), inclusive, of section 46b-220 , provided such failure was without good cause; (C) issue an income withholding order against such amount of any debt accruing by reason of personal services as provided by sections 52-362 , 52-362b and 52-362c ; and (D) order executions against any real, personal, or other property of such person which cannot be categorized solely as either, for payment of accrued and unpaid amounts due under such order.",
              "(10) No entry fee, judgment fee or any other court fee shall be charged by the court or the family support magistrate to either party in proceedings under this section.",
              "(11) Any written agreement to support which is filed with the court or the Family Support Magistrate Division shall have the effect of an order of the court or a family support magistrate.",
              "(b) The Attorney General of the state of Connecticut and the attorney representing a town shall become a party for the interest of the state of Connecticut and such town in any proceedings for support which concerns any person who is receiving or has received public assistance or care from the state or any town. The Attorney General shall represent the IV-D agency in non-TFA IV-D support cases if the IV-D agency determines that such representation is required pursuant to guidelines issued by the Commissioner of Social Services.",
              "(c) The court or a family support magistrate shall direct all payments on orders of support in IV-D cases to be made to the state acting by and through the IV-D agency. In IV-D support cases, the IV-D agency or a support enforcement agency under cooperative agreement with the IV-D agency may, upon notice to the obligor and obligee, redirect payments for the support of any child receiving child support enforcement services either to the state of Connecticut or to the present custodial party, as their interests may appear, provided neither the obligor nor the obligee objects in writing within ten business days from the mailing date of such notice. Any such notice shall be sent by first class mail to the most recent address of such obligor and obligee, as recorded in the state case registry pursuant to section 46b-218 , and a copy of such notice shall be filed with the court or family support magistrate if both the obligor and obligee fail to object to the redirected payments within ten business days from the mailing date of such notice. All payments made shall be distributed as required by Title IV-D of the Social Security Act.",
              "(d) No order for support made by the court or a family support magistrate shall be stayed by an appeal but such order shall continue in effect until a determination is made thereon upon such appeal; if however as a result of such appeal or further hearing, the amount of such order is reduced or vacated, such defendant shall be credited or reimbursed accordingly.",
              "(e) Except as provided in sections 46b-301 to 46b-425 , inclusive, any court or family support magistrate, called upon to enforce a support order, shall insure that such order is reasonable in light of the obligor's ability to pay. Except as provided in sections 46b-301 to 46b-425 , inclusive, any support order entered pursuant to this section, or any support order from another jurisdiction subject to enforcement by the state of Connecticut, may be modified by motion of the party seeking such modification upon a showing of a substantial change in the circumstances of either party or upon a showing that such support order substantially deviates from the child support guidelines established pursuant to section 46b-215a , unless there was a specific finding on the record at a hearing, or in a written judgment, order or memorandum of decision of the court, that the application of the guidelines would be inequitable or inappropriate, provided the court or family support magistrate finds that the obligor or the obligee and any other interested party have received actual notice of the pendency of such motion and of the time and place of the hearing on such motion. There shall be a rebuttable presumption that any deviation of less than fifteen per cent from the child support guidelines is not substantial and any deviation of fifteen per cent or more from the guidelines is substantial. Modification may be made of such support order without regard to whether the order was issued before, on or after May 9, 1991. No such support orders may be subject to retroactive modification, except that the court or family support magistrate may order modification with respect to any period during which there is a pending motion for a modification of an existing support order from the date of service of the notice of such pending motion upon the opposing party pursuant to section 52-50 . In any hearing to modify any support order from another jurisdiction the court or the family support magistrate shall conduct the proceedings in accordance with sections 46b-384 to 46b-387 , inclusive.",
              "(f) In IV-D support cases, as defined in subdivision (13) of subsection (b) of section 46b-231 , a copy of any support order established or modified pursuant to this section or, in the case of a motion for modification of an existing support order, a notice of determination that there should be no change in the amount of the support order, shall be provided to each party and the state case registry within fourteen days after issuance of such order or determination.",

If such child is unmarried and a full-time high school student, such support shall continue according to the parents' respective abilities, if such child is in need of support, until such child completes the twelfth grade or attains the age of nineteen, whichever occurs first.\n\n(2) Any such support order in a IV-D support case shall include a provision for the health care coverage of the child. Such provision may include an order for either parent or both parents to provide such coverage under any or all of subparagraphs (A), (B) or (C) of this subdivision.\n\n(A) The provision for health care coverage may include an order for either parent to name any child as a beneficiary of any medical or dental insurance or benefit plan carried by such parent or available to such parent at a reasonable cost, as defined in subparagraph (D) of this subdivision. If such order requires the parent to maintain insurance available through an employer, the order shall be enforced using a National Medical Support Notice as provided in section 46b-88 .\n\n(B) The provision for health care coverage may include an order for either parent to: (i) Apply for and maintain coverage on behalf of the child under the HUSKY Plan, Part B; or (ii) provide cash medical support, as described in subparagraphs (E) and (F) of this subdivision.

An order for cash medical support shall be payable to the state or the custodial party, as their interests may appear, provided an order under clause (i) of this subparagraph shall be effective only as long as health insurance coverage is maintained. Any unreimbursed medical and dental expenses not covered by an order issued pursuant to clause (ii) of this subparagraph are subject to an order for unreimbursed medical and dental expenses pursuant to subparagraph (C) of this subdivision.\n\n(F) Cash medical support to offset the cost of any insurance payable under the HUSKY Plan, Part A or Part B, shall not be ordered against a noncustodial parent who is a low-income obligor, as defined in the child support guidelines established pursuant to section 46b-215a , or against a custodial parent of children covered under the HUSKY Plan, Part A or Part B.\n\n(3) Proceedings to obtain orders of support under this section shall be commenced by the service on the liable person or persons of a verified petition, with summons and order, of the husband or wife, child or any relative or the conservator, guardian or support enforcement officer, town or state, or any selectmen or the public official charged with the administration of public assistance of the town, or in IV-D support cases, as defined in subdivision (13) of subsection (b) of section 46b-231 , the Commissioner of Social Services. The verified petition, summons and order shall be filed in the judicial district in which the petitioner or respondent resides or does business, or if filed in the Family Support Magistrate Division, in the judicial district in which the petitioner or respondent resides or does business.\n\n(4) For purposes of this section, the term “child” shall include one born to parents married to each other whose alleged genetic parent has acknowledged in writing parentage of such child or has been adjudged the parent by a court of competent jurisdiction, or a child who was born before marriage whose parents afterwards intermarry.\n\n(5) Said court or family support magistrate shall also have authority to make and enforce orders directed to the conservator or guardian of any person, or payee of Social Security or other benefits to which such person is entitled, to the extent of the income or estate held by such fiduciary or payee in any such capacity.\n\n(6) Said court or family support magistrate shall also have authority to determine, order and enforce payment of any sums due under a written agreement to support against the person liable for such support under such agreement.\n\n(7) (A) The court or family support magistrate may also determine, order and enforce payment of any support due because of neglect or refusal to furnish support for periods prior to the action. In the case of a child born out of wedlock whose parents have not intermarried, a parent's liability for such support shall be limited to the three years next preceding the filing of a petition or written agreement to support pursuant to this section.\n\n(B) In the determination of support due based on neglect or refusal to furnish support prior to the action, the support due for periods of time prior to the action shall be based upon the obligor's ability to pay during such prior periods, as determined in accordance with the child support guidelines established pursuant to section 46b-215a . The state shall disclose to the court any information in its possession concerning current and past ability to pay. If no information is available to the court concerning past ability to pay, the court may determine the support due for periods of time prior to the action as if past ability to pay is equal to current ability to pay, if current ability is known. If current ability to pay is not known, the court shall determine the past ability to pay based on the obligor's work history, if known, or if not known, on the state minimum wage that was in effect during such periods, provided only actual earnings shall be used to determine ability to pay for past periods during which the obligor was a full-time high school student or was incarcerated, institutionalized or incapacitated.\n\n(C) Any finding of support due for periods of time prior to an action in which the obligor failed to appear shall be entered subject to adjustment. Such adjustment may be made upon motion of any party, and the state in IV-D cases shall make such motion if it obtains information that would have substantially affected the court's determination of past ability to pay if such information had been available to the court. Motion for adjustment under this subparagraph may be made not later than twelve months from the date upon which the obligor receives notification of (i) the amount of such finding of support due for periods of time prior to the action, and (ii) the right not later than twelve months from the date of receipt of such notification to present evidence as to such obligor's past ability to pay support for such periods of time prior to the action. A copy of any support order entered, subject to adjustment, shall state in plain language the basis for the court's determination of past support, the right to request an adjustment and to present information concerning the obligor's past ability to pay, and the consequences of a failure to request such adjustment.\n\n(8) (A) The judge or family support magistrate shall cause a summons, signed by such judge or magistrate, by the clerk of said court or Family Support Magistrate Division, or by a commissioner of the Superior Court to be issued requiring such liable person or persons to appear in court or before a family support magistrate, at a time and place as determined by the clerk but not more than ninety days after the issuance of the summons. Service may be made by a state marshal, any proper officer or any investigator employed by the Department of Social Services or by the Commissioner of Administrative Services. The state marshal, proper officer or investigator shall make due return of process to the court not less than twenty-one days before the date assigned for hearing. Upon proof of the service of the summons to appear in court or before a family support magistrate at the time and place named for hearing upon such petition, the failure of the defendant or defendants to appear shall not prohibit the court or family support magistrate from going forward with the hearing. If the summons and order is signed by a commissioner of the Superior Court, upon proof of service of the summons to appear in court or before a family support magistrate and upon the failure of the defendant to appear at the time and place named for hearing upon the petition, request may be made by the petitioner to the court or family support magistrate for an order that a capias mittimus be issued.\n\n(B) In the case of a person supported wholly or in part by a town, the welfare authority of the town shall notify the responsible relatives of such person of the amount of assistance given, the beginning date thereof and the amount of support expected from each of them, if any, and if any such relative does not contribute in such expected amount, the superior court for the judicial district in which such town is located or a family support magistrate sitting in the judicial district in which such town is located may order such relative or relatives to contribute to such support, from the time of the beginning date of expense shown on the notice, such sum as said court or family support magistrate deems reasonably within each such relative's ability to support such person.\n\n(C) The court, or any judge thereof, or family support magistrate when said court or family support magistrate is not sitting, may require the defendant or defendants to become bound, with sufficient surety, to the state, town or person bringing the complaint, to abide such judgment as may be rendered on such complaint. Failure of the defendant or defendants to obey any order made under this section may be punished as contempt of court and the costs of commitment of any person imprisoned for contempt shall be paid by the state as in criminal cases. Except as otherwise provided, upon proof of the service of the summons to appear in court or before a family support magistrate at the time and place named for a hearing upon the failure of the defendant or defendants to obey such court order or order of the family support magistrate, the court or family support magistrate may order a capias mittimus be issued and directed to a judicial marshal to the extent authorized pursuant to section 46b-225 , or any other proper officer to arrest such defendant or defendants and bring such defendant or defendants before the Superior Court for the contempt hearing. When any person is found in contempt under this section, the court or family support magistrate may award to the petitioner a reasonable attorney's fee and the fees of the officer serving the contempt citation, such sums to be paid by the person found in contempt.\n\n(9) In addition to or in lieu of such contempt proceedings, the court or family support magistrate, upon a finding that any person has failed to obey any order made under this section, may: (A) Order a plan for payment of any past-due support owing under such order, or, in IV-D cases, if such obligor is not incapacitated, order such obligor to participate in work activities which may include, but shall not be limited to, job search, training, work experience and participation in the job training and retraining program established by the Labor Commissioner pursuant to section 31-3t ; (B) suspend any professional, occupational, recreational, commercial driver's or motor vehicle operator's license as provided in subsections (b) to (e), inclusive, of section 46b-220 , provided such failure was without good cause; (C) issue an income withholding order against such amount of any debt accruing by reason of personal services as provided by sections 52-362 , 52-362b and 52-362c ; and (D) order executions against any real, personal, or other property of such person which cannot be categorized solely as either, for payment of accrued and unpaid amounts due under such order.\n\n(10) No entry fee, judgment fee or any other court fee shall be charged by the court or the family support magistrate to either party in proceedings under this section.\n\n(11) Any written agreement to support which is filed with the court or the Family Support Magistrate Division shall have the effect of an order of the court or a family support magistrate.\n\n(b) The Attorney General of the state of Connecticut and the attorney representing a town shall become a party for the interest of the state of Connecticut and such town in any proceedings for support which concerns any person who is receiving or has received public assistance or care from the state or any town. The Attorney General shall represent the IV-D agency in non-TFA IV-D support cases if the IV-D agency determines that such representation is required pursuant to guidelines issued by the Commissioner of Social Services.\n\n(c) The court or a family support magistrate shall direct all payments on orders of support in IV-D cases to be made to the state acting by and through the IV-D agency. In IV-D support cases, the IV-D agency or a support enforcement agency under cooperative agreement with the IV-D agency may, upon notice to the obligor and obligee, redirect payments for the support of any child receiving child support enforcement services either to the state of Connecticut or to the present custodial party, as their interests may appear, provided neither the obligor nor the obligee objects in writing within ten business days from the mailing date of such notice. Any such notice shall be sent by first class mail to the most recent address of such obligor and obligee, as recorded in the state case registry pursuant to section 46b-218 , and a copy of such notice shall be filed with the court or family support magistrate if both the obligor and obligee fail to object to the redirected payments within ten business days from the mailing date of such notice. All payments made shall be distributed as required by Title IV-D of the Social Security Act.\n\n(d) No order for support made by the court or a family support magistrate shall be stayed by an appeal but such order shall continue in effect until a determination is made thereon upon such appeal; if however as a result of such appeal or further hearing, the amount of such order is reduced or vacated, such defendant shall be credited or reimbursed accordingly.\n\n(e) Except as provided in sections 46b-301 to 46b-425 , inclusive, any court or family support magistrate, called upon to enforce a support order, shall insure that such order is reasonable in light of the obligor's ability to pay. Except as provided in sections 46b-301 to 46b-425 , inclusive, any support order entered pursuant to this section, or any support order from another jurisdiction subject to enforcement by the state of Connecticut, may be modified by motion of the party seeking such modification upon a showing of a substantial change in the circumstances of either party or upon a showing that such support order substantially deviates from the child support guidelines established pursuant to section 46b-215a , unless there was a specific finding on the record at a hearing, or in a written judgment, order or memorandum of decision of the court, that the application of the guidelines would be inequitable or inappropriate, provided the court or family support magistrate finds that the obligor or the obligee and any other interested party have received actual notice of the pendency of such motion and of the time and place of the hearing on such motion. There shall be a rebuttable presumption that any deviation of less than fifteen per cent from the child support guidelines is not substantial and any deviation of fifteen per cent or more from the guidelines is substantial. Modification may be made of such support order without regard to whether the order was issued before, on or after May 9, 1991. No such support orders may be subject to retroactive modification, except that the court or family support magistrate may order modification with respect to any period during which there is a pending motion for a modification of an existing support order from the date of service of the notice of such pending motion upon the opposing party pursuant to section 52-50 . In any hearing to modify any support order from another jurisdiction the court or the family support magistrate shall conduct the proceedings in accordance with sections 46b-384 to 46b-387 , inclusive.\n\n(f) In IV-D support cases, as defined in subdivision (13) of subsection (b) of section 46b-231 , a copy of any support order established or modified pursuant to this section or, in the case of a motion for modification of an existing support order, a notice of determination that there should be no change in the amount of the support order, shall be provided to each party and the state case registry within fourteen days after issuance of such order or determination.\n\nSee Sec. 46b-88 re National Medical Support Notice.\n\nSee Sec. 46b-219 re child's freedom from responsibility to support a deserting parent.\n\nSee Sec. 51-348a re prosecution for nonsupport.\n\nSee Sec. 52-56(d) re execution or service of capias mittimus in any precinct by state marshal of any precinct.\n\nSee Sec. 53-304 re procedures when support not provided and penalties for failure to provide support."

Child support guidelines must be considered in any marital dissolution action involving minor children, and there is no exception to this mandate for unallocated awards of alimony and child support. 138 CA 544. Trial court did not deviate from child support guidelines in issuing order for extracurricular activities expenses, such order was not a basic child support order issued pursuant to this section and therefore the court was not required to make specific finding on the record that application of the guidelines would be inequitable or inappropriate. 223 CA 69."

If such recipient appears, either personally or through a representative, at such hearing, the family support magistrate shall determine whether the order in effect for child support is reasonable in relation to the current financial circumstances of the parties, prior to modifying an order increasing such periodic arrearage payments.",

A person who is aggrieved by a decision of a family support magistrate modifying a Superior Court order is entitled to appeal such decision in accordance with the provisions of subsection (n) of this section.",

Such support agreements shall be reviewed by a family support magistrate who shall approve or disapprove the agreement.

Upon such disapproval, the clerk shall schedule a hearing for the purpose of determining appropriate support amounts and shall notify all appearing parties of the hearing date.",
              "(7) Family support magistrates shall enforce orders for child and spousal support entered by such family support magistrate and by the Superior Court in IV-D support cases by citing an obligor for contempt.

Upon failure of the obligor to post such bond, the family support magistrate may refer the obligor to a community correctional center until he has complied with such order, provided the obligor shall be heard at the next regular session of the Family Support Magistrate Division in the court to which he was summoned. If no regular session is held within seven days of such referral, the family support magistrate shall either cause a special session of the Family Support Magistrate Division to be convened, or the obligor shall be heard by a Superior Court judge in the judicial district in which the matter is pending. If the obligor fails to appear before the family support magistrate at the time and place he is ordered to appear, the family support magistrate may order the bond, if any, forfeited, and the proceeds thereof distributed as required by Title IV-D of the Social Security Act, and the family support magistrate may issue a capias mittimus for the arrest of the obligor, ordering him to appear before the family support magistrate. A family support magistrate may determine whether or not an obligor is in contempt of the order of the Superior Court or of a family support magistrate and may make such orders as are provided by law to enforce a support obligation, except that if the family support magistrate determines that incarceration of an obligor for failure to obey a support order may be indicated, the family support magistrate shall inform the obligor of his right to be represented by an attorney and his right to a court-appointed attorney to represent him if he is indigent. If the obligor claims he is indigent and desires an attorney to represent him, the family support magistrate shall conduct a hearing to determine if the obligor is indigent. If, after such hearing, the family support magistrate finds that the obligor is indigent, the family support magistrate shall appoint an attorney to represent the obligor.",
              "(8) Agreements between parties as to custody and visitation of minor children in IV-D support cases may be filed with the assistant clerk of the Family Support Magistrate Division. Such agreements shall be reviewed by a family support magistrate, who shall approve the agreement unless he finds such agreement is not in the best interests of the child. Agreements between parties as to custody and visitation in IV-D support cases shall be enforced in the same manner as agreements for support are enforced, pursuant to subdivision (7) of this subsection.",
              "(9) Agreements between the parties as to the modification or enforcement of support orders in IV-D support cases may be filed with the assistant clerk of the Family Support Magistrate Division for the judicial district where the mother or father of the child resides and where the parties have submitted to a motion for modification or an application for contempt of an existing child or spousal support order. Such agreements may be approved by the family support magistrate after an inquiry into the financial needs, resources and the respective abilities of the parties. The inquiry required pursuant to this subdivision may take place on the record at a hearing, or may be made on the basis of an affidavit from each party, made under oath, stating that (A) each party has the financial resources and other facts satisfying any requirement of the inquiry in question, and (B) that no restraining order issued pursuant to section 46b-15 or protective order issued pursuant to section 46b-38c , between the parties is in effect or pending before the court. If each party so attests, a family support magistrate may (i) determine whether the agreement between the parties as to modification or enforcement of a support order is fair and equitable under all the circumstances, and (ii) make any other findings required by this section.",
              "(10) Whenever an obligor is before a family support magistrate in proceedings to establish, modify or enforce a support order in a IV-D support case and such order is not secured by an income withholding order, the family support magistrate may require the obligor to execute a bond or post other security sufficient to perform such order for support, provided the family support magistrate finds that such a bond is available for purchase within the financial means of the obligor. Upon failure of such obligor to comply with such support order, the family support magistrate may order the bond or the security forfeited and the proceeds thereof distributed as required by Title IV-D of the Social Security Act.",
              "(11) In any proceeding in the Family Support Magistrate Division, if the family support magistrate finds that a party is indigent and unable to pay a fee or fees payable to the court or to pay the cost of service of process, the family support magistrate shall waive such fee or fees and the cost of service of process shall be paid by the state.",
              "(12) A family support magistrate may dismiss any action or proceeding which the family support magistrate may hear and determine.",
              "(13) A family support magistrate may order parties to participate in the parenting education program in accordance with the provisions of section 46b-69b .",

If such recipient appears, either personally or through a representative, at such hearing, the family support magistrate shall determine whether the order in effect for child support is reasonable in relation to the current financial circumstances of the parties, prior to modifying an order increasing such periodic arrearage payments.\n\n(3) Family support magistrates shall review and approve or disapprove all agreements for support in IV-D support cases filed with the Family Support Magistrate Division in accordance with sections 17b-179 , 17b-745 , 46b-215 , 46b-570 and subsection (c) of section 53-304 .\n\n(4) Motions for modification of existing child and spousal support orders entered by the Superior Court in IV-D support cases, including motions to modify existing child and spousal support orders entered in actions brought pursuant to chapter 815j, shall be brought in the Family Support Magistrate Division and decided by a family support magistrate.

If the support agreement filed with the clerk is disapproved by a family support magistrate, the reason for disapproval shall be stated in the record and such disapproval shall have a retroactive effect. Upon such disapproval, the clerk shall schedule a hearing for the purpose of determining appropriate support amounts and shall notify all appearing parties of the hearing date.\n\n(7) Family support magistrates shall enforce orders for child and spousal support entered by such family support magistrate and by the Superior Court in IV-D support cases by citing an obligor for contempt. Family support magistrates, in IV-D support cases, may order any obligor who is subject to a plan for reimbursement of past-due support and is not incapacitated, to participate in work activities which may include, but shall not be limited to, job search, training, work experience and participation in the job training and retraining program established by the Labor Commissioner pursuant to section 31-3t . Family support magistrates shall also enforce income withholding orders entered pursuant to section 52-362 , including any additional amounts to be applied toward liquidation of any arrearage, as required under subsection (e) of said section. Family support magistrates may require the obligor to furnish recognizance to the state of Connecticut in the form of a cash deposit or bond of such character and in such amount as the Family Support Magistrate Division deems proper to assure appearance at the next regular session of the Family Support Magistrate Division in the judicial district in which the matter is pending. Upon failure of the obligor to post such bond, the family support magistrate may refer the obligor to a community correctional center until he has complied with such order, provided the obligor shall be heard at the next regular session of the Family Support Magistrate Division in the court to which he was summoned. If no regular session is held within seven days of such referral, the family support magistrate shall either cause a special session of the Family Support Magistrate Division to be convened, or the obligor shall be heard by a Superior Court judge in the judicial district in which the matter is pending. If the obligor fails to appear before the family support magistrate at the time and place he is ordered to appear, the family support magistrate may order the bond, if any, forfeited, and the proceeds thereof distributed as required by Title IV-D of the Social Security Act, and the family support magistrate may issue a capias mittimus for the arrest of the obligor, ordering him to appear before the family support magistrate. A family support magistrate may determine whether or not an obligor is in contempt of the order of the Superior Court or of a family support magistrate and may make such orders as are provided by law to enforce a support obligation, except that if the family support magistrate determines that incarceration of an obligor for failure to obey a support order may be indicated, the family support magistrate shall inform the obligor of his right to be represented by an attorney and his right to a court-appointed attorney to represent him if he is indigent. If the obligor claims he is indigent and desires an attorney to represent him, the family support magistrate shall conduct a hearing to determine if the obligor is indigent. If, after such hearing, the family support magistrate finds that the obligor is indigent, the family support magistrate shall appoint an attorney to represent the obligor.\n\n(8) Agreements between parties as to custody and visitation of minor children in IV-D support cases may be filed with the assistant clerk of the Family Support Magistrate Division. Such agreements shall be reviewed by a family support magistrate, who shall approve the agreement unless he finds such agreement is not in the best interests of the child. Agreements between parties as to custody and visitation in IV-D support cases shall be enforced in the same manner as agreements for support are enforced, pursuant to subdivision (7) of this subsection.\n\n(9) Agreements between the parties as to the modification or enforcement of support orders in IV-D support cases may be filed with the assistant clerk of the Family Support Magistrate Division for the judicial district where the mother or father of the child resides and where the parties have submitted to a motion for modification or an application for contempt of an existing child or spousal support order. Such agreements may be approved by the family support magistrate after an inquiry into the financial needs, resources and the respective abilities of the parties. The inquiry required pursuant to this subdivision may take place on the record at a hearing, or may be made on the basis of an affidavit from each party, made under oath, stating that (A) each party has the financial resources and other facts satisfying any requirement of the inquiry in question, and (B) that no restraining order issued pursuant to section 46b-15 or protective order issued pursuant to section 46b-38c , between the parties is in effect or pending before the court. If each party so attests, a family support magistrate may (i) determine whether the agreement between the parties as to modification or enforcement of a support order is fair and equitable under all the circumstances, and (ii) make any other findings required by this section.\n\n(10) Whenever an obligor is before a family support magistrate in proceedings to establish, modify or enforce a support order in a IV-D support case and such order is not secured by an income withholding order, the family support magistrate may require the obligor to execute a bond or post other security sufficient to perform such order for support, provided the family support magistrate finds that such a bond is available for purchase within the financial means of the obligor. Upon failure of such obligor to comply with such support order, the family support magistrate may order the bond or the security forfeited and the proceeds thereof distributed as required by Title IV-D of the Social Security Act.\n\n(11) In any proceeding in the Family Support Magistrate Division, if the family support magistrate finds that a party is indigent and unable to pay a fee or fees payable to the court or to pay the cost of service of process, the family support magistrate shall waive such fee or fees and the cost of service of process shall be paid by the state.\n\n(12) A family support magistrate may dismiss any action or proceeding which the family support magistrate may hear and determine.\n\n(13) A family support magistrate may order parties to participate in the parenting education program in accordance with the provisions of section 46b-69b .\n\n(14) Family support magistrates may issue writs of habeas corpus ad testificandum in IV-D support cases for persons in the custody of the Commissioner of Correction.\n\n(15) A family support magistrate may, upon the filing of a motion to modify an existing support order based on the fact that the Social Security Administration, or a state agency authorized to award disability benefits has determined that the obligor qualifies for disability benefits under the federal Supplemental Security Income Program and the filing of an affidavit by a support enforcement officer: (A) Modify the existing support order to zero dollars without a hearing; (B) schedule the motion for a hearing; or (C) deny the motion without a hearing. The support enforcement officer's affidavit shall state: (i) The date that the child support obligor qualified for benefits under the federal Supplemental Security Income Program; (ii) that the support enforcement officer confirmed such benefits with the federal Social Security Administration or another federal agency with access to Social Security Administration applicant and benefit information; (iii) that a diligent search failed to identify any other income or assets that could be used to satisfy the child support order; (iv) that support enforcement services provided notice to the custodial party in accordance with section 52-57 or by certified mail, return receipt requested, of the proposed modification, that the custodial party had the right to object to the proposed modification, and that support enforcement services must receive any objection to the proposed modification not later than fifteen calendar days after the date that the custodial party received such notice; and (v) that support enforcement services did not receive an objection from the custodial party. Any support order modified pursuant to this subdivision may be later modified upon a finding of a substantial change in circumstances. Nothing in this subdivision shall preclude a family support magistrate from modifying an existing support order under any other section of the general statutes.\n\n(n) (1) A person who is aggrieved by a final decision of a family support magistrate is entitled to judicial review by way of appeal under this section.\n\n(2) Proceedings for such appeal shall be instituted by filing a petition in superior court for the judicial district in which the decision of the family support magistrate was rendered not later than fourteen days after filing of the final decision with an assistant clerk assigned to the Family Support Magistrate Division or, if a rehearing is requested, not later than fourteen days after filing of the notice of the decision thereon. In a IV-D support case, such petitions shall be accompanied by a certification that copies of the petition have been served upon the IV-D agency as defined in subsection (b) of this section and all parties of record. Service upon the IV-D agency may be made by the appellant mailing a copy of the petition by certified mail to the office of the Attorney General in Hartford.\n\n(3) Within fourteen days after the filing of the petition, or within such further time as may be allowed by the court, the Family Support Magistrate Division shall transmit to the reviewing court the original or a certified copy of the entire record of the proceeding appealed from, which shall include the decision of the family support magistrate. The court may require or permit subsequent corrections or additions to the record.\n\n(4) The aggrieved party shall file with his appeal a statement that no transcript is required for the purpose of determining the issues raised on appeal or a statement that he has ordered a transcript. A transcript may be filed by any party to an appeal and shall be filed within thirty days from the filing of said appeal unless the time for filing such transcript is extended by order of the Superior Court or the family support magistrate. Costs of preparing the transcript shall be paid by the party ordering the preparation of the transcript.\n\n(5) If, before the date set for hearing, application is made to the Superior Court for leave to present additional evidence, and it is shown to the satisfaction of the court that the additional evidence is material and that there were good reasons for failure to present it in the proceeding before the family support magistrate, the Superior Court may permit additional evidence be taken before it upon conditions determined by the court.\n\n(6) The appeal shall be conducted by the Superior Court without a jury and shall be confined to the record and such additional evidence as the Superior Court has permitted to be introduced. The Superior Court, upon request, shall hear oral argument and receive written briefs.\n\n(7) The Superior Court may affirm the decision of the family support magistrate or remand the case for further proceedings. The Superior Court may reverse or modify the decision if substantial rights of the appellant have been prejudiced because the decision of the family support magistrate is: (A) In violation of constitutional or statutory provisions; (B) in excess of the statutory authority of the family support magistrate; (C) made upon unlawful procedure; (D) affected by other error of law; (E) clearly erroneous in view of the reliable, probative, and substantial evidence on the whole record; or (F) arbitrary or capricious or characterized by abuse of discretion or clearly unwarranted exercise of discretion.\n\n(8) Any order entered by the court pursuant to an appeal under this subsection may be retroactive to the date of the original order entered by the family support magistrate.\n\n(9) Upon all such appeals which are denied, costs may be taxed in favor of the prevailing party at the discretion of the Superior Court, but no costs shall be taxed against the state.\n\n(10) In any case in which any party claims that he cannot pay the costs of an appeal or defending an appeal under this section, he shall, within the time permitted for filing the appeal, or the time permitted for filing of a transcript of testimony if preparation of such transcript is required, file with the clerk of the superior court to which the appeal is to be taken an application for waiver of payment of such fees, costs and necessary expenses. The application shall conform to rules adopted pursuant to section 51-14 . After such hearing as the Superior Court determines is necessary, the Superior Court shall enter its judgment on the application, which judgment shall contain a statement of the facts the Superior Court has found, with its conclusions thereon. The filing of the application for the waiver shall toll the time limits for the filing of an appeal until such time as a judgment on such application is entered.\n\n(o) Upon final determination of any appeal from a decision of a family support magistrate by the Superior Court, there shall be no right to further review except to the Appellate Court. The procedure on such appeal to the Appellate Court shall, except as otherwise provided herein, be in accordance with the procedures provided by rule or law for the appeal of judgments rendered by the Superior Court unless modified by rule of the judges of the Appellate Court. There shall be no right to further review except to the Supreme Court pursuant to the provisions of section 51-197f .\n\n(p) The filing of an appeal from a decision of a family support magistrate does not affect the order of support of a family support magistrate, but it shall continue in effect until the appeal is decided, and thereafter, unless denied, until changed by further order of a family support magistrate or the Superior Court.\n\n(q) When an order for child or spousal support has been entered against an obligor by the Superior Court in an action originating in the Superior Court, such order shall supersede any previous order for child or spousal support against such obligor entered by a family support magistrate and shall also supersede any previous agreement for support executed by such obligor and filed with the Family Support Magistrate Division.\n\n(r) Orders for support entered by a family support magistrate shall have the same force and effect as orders of the Superior Court, except where otherwise provided in sections 17b-81 , 17b-93 , 17b-179 , 17b-743 , 17b-744 , 17b-745 , and 17b-746 , 46b-55 , 46b-59a , 46b-86 and 46b-570 , this chapter, subsection (b) of section 51-348 , section 52-362 , subsection (a) of section 52-362d , subsection (a) of section 52-362e and subsection (c) of section 53-304 , and shall be considered orders of the Superior Court for the purpose of establishing and enforcing support orders of the family support magistrate, as provided in sections 17b-81 , 17b-93 , 17b-179 , 17b-745 , 52-362 , 52-362d , 52-362e and 53-304 , except as otherwise provided in this section. All orders for support issued by family support magistrates in any matter before a magistrate shall contain an order for withholding to enforce such orders as set forth in section 52-362 .\n\n(s) Support enforcement officers of Support Enforcement Services of the Superior Court shall:\n\n(1) Supervise the payment of any child or spousal support order in IV-D support cases and cases under sections 46b-301 to 46b-425 , inclusive. Supervision of such orders is defined as the utilization of all procedures available by law to collect child or spousal support, or enforce medical support including (A) issuance and implementation of income withholdings ordered by the Superior Court or a family support magistrate pursuant to section 52-362 , (B) issuance of an order requiring any party to appear before a family support magistrate on an action to modify a support order pursuant to subdivision (4) of this subsection, (C) issuance of a capias mittimus directed to a proper officer to arrest an obligor or witness and bring such obligor or witness before a family support magistrate if such obligor or witness is served with a summons, subpoena, citation or order to appear issued by a family support magistrate, the assistant clerk of the Family Support Magistrate Division or a support enforcement officer and fails to appear, (D) if necessary, bringing an application for contempt to a family support magistrate and, in connection with such application, issuing an order requiring the obligor to appear before a family support magistrate to show cause why such obligor should not be held in contempt for failure to pay an order for child or spousal support entered by the Superior Court or a family support magistrate, (E) issuance of a National Medical Support Notice in accordance with section 46b-88 , and (F) taking of acknowledgements of parties to agreements incident to the duties under subdivision (4) of this subsection;\n\n(2) In non-TFA cases, have the authority to bring petitions for support orders pursuant to section 46b-215 , file agreements for support with the assistant clerk of the Family Support Magistrate Division, and bring applications for show cause orders pursuant to section 46b-570 , and in IV-D support cases and cases under sections 46b-301 to 46b-425 , inclusive, enforce foreign support orders registered with the Family Support Magistrate Division pursuant to sections 46b-364 to 46b-372 , inclusive, and file agreements for support with the assistant clerk of the Family Support Magistrate Division;\n\n(3) In connection with any order or agreement entered by, or filed with, the Family Support Magistrate Division, or any order entered by the Superior Court in a IV-D support case, upon order, investigate the financial situation of the parties and report findings to the family support magistrate regarding: (A) Any pending motion to modify such order or agreement; or (B) any request or application for modification of such order or agreement made by an obligee;\n\n(4) Review child support orders (A) in non-TFA IV-D support cases (i) at the request of either parent or custodial party subject to a support order, or (ii) upon receipt of information indicating a substantial change in circumstances of any party to the support order, (B) in TFA cases, at the request of the Office of Child Support Services, or (C) as necessary to comply with federal requirements for the child support enforcement program mandated by Title IV-D of the Social Security Act, and initiate an action before a family support magistrate to modify such support order if it is determined upon such review that the order substantially deviates from the child support guidelines established pursuant to section 46b-215a . A requesting party under subparagraph (A)(i) or (B) of this subdivision shall have a right to such review every three years without proving a substantial change in circumstances, but more frequent reviews shall be made only if such requesting party demonstrates a substantial change in circumstances. There shall be a rebuttable presumption that any deviation of less than fifteen per cent from the child support guidelines is not substantial and any deviation of fifteen per cent or more from the guidelines is substantial. Modification may be made of such support order without regard to whether the order was issued before, on or after May 9, 1991. In determining whether to modify a child support order based on a substantial deviation from such child support guidelines, consideration shall be given to the division of real and personal property between the parties set forth in any final decree entered pursuant to chapter 815j and the benefits accruing to the child as the result of such division. No order for periodic payment of support may be subject to retroactive modification, except that the family support magistrate may order modification with respect to any period during which there is a pending motion for modification of a support order from the date of service of notice of such pending motion to the opposing party pursuant to section 52-50 ; and\n\n(5) In proceedings before the Family Support Magistrate Division under the Uniform Interstate Family Support Act (A) perform clerical, administrative and other nonjudicial functions on behalf of the Family Support Magistrate Division; (B) maintain a registry of support orders and judgments; and (C) assist the IV-D agency in performing its functions under sections 46b-398 to 46b-410 , inclusive.\n\n(t) The Attorney General shall:\n\n(1) Represent the interest of the state in all actions for child or spousal support in all cases in which the state is furnishing or has furnished aid or care to one of the parties to the action or a child of one of the parties;\n\n(2) In interstate support enforcement under sections 46b-301 to 46b-425 , inclusive, provide necessary legal services on behalf of the support enforcement agency in providing services to a petitioner; and\n\n(3) Represent the IV-D agency in providing support enforcement services in non-TFA IV-D support cases pursuant to sections 17b-179 , 17b-745 and 46b-215 .\n\n(u) (1) The Department of Social Services may in IV-D cases (A) bring petitions for support orders pursuant to section 46b-215 , (B) obtain acknowledgments of parentage, (C) bring applications for show cause orders pursuant to section 46b-570 , (D) file agreements for support with the assistant clerk of the Family Support Magistrate Division, (E) issue withholding orders entered by the Superior Court or a family support magistrate in accordance with subsection (b) of section 52-362 , and (F) upon notice to the obligor and obligee, redirect payments for the support of any child receiving child support enforcement services either to the state of Connecticut or to the present custodial party, as their interests may appear, for distribution in accordance with Title IV-D of the Social Security Act, provided neither the obligor nor the obligee objects in writing within ten business days from the mailing date of such notice, and provided further that any such notice shall be sent by first class mail to the most recent address of such obligor and obligee, as recorded in the state case registry pursuant to section 46b-218 , and a copy of such notice shall be filed with the court or family support magistrate if both the obligor and obligee fail to object to the redirected payments within ten business days from the mailing date of such notice.\n\n(2) The Department of Social Services shall provide notice not less than once every three years to the parents subject to a support order in a IV-D case informing the parents of their right to request a review under subdivision (4) of subsection (s) of this section.\n\nSee Sec. 52-56(d) re execution or service of capias mittimus in any precinct by state marshal of any precinct."

              "(a)(1)(A) If the defendant is found to be the parent of the child, the court or family support magistrate shall order the defendant to stand charged with the support and maintenance of such child, with the assistance of any other parent if such parent is financially able, as the court or family support magistrate finds, in accordance with the provisions of subsection (b) of section 17b-179 , or section 17a-90 , 17b-81 , 17b-223 , 17b-745 , 46b-129 , 46b-130 or 46b-215 , to be reasonably commensurate with the financial ability of the defendant, and to pay a certain sum periodically until the child attains the age of eighteen years or as otherwise provided in this subsection. If such child is unmarried and a full-time high school student, such support shall continue according to the parents' respective abilities, if such child is in need of support, until such child completes the twelfth grade or attains the age of nineteen, whichever occurs first.",
              "(B) The court or family support magistrate shall order the defendant to pay such sum to the complainant, or, if a town or the state has paid such expense, to the town or the state, as the case may be, and shall grant execution for the same and costs of suit taxed as in other civil actions, together with a reasonable attorney's fee, and may require the defendant to become bound with sufficient surety to perform such orders for support and maintenance. In IV-D support cases, the IV-D agency or a support enforcement agency under cooperative agreement with the IV-D agency may, upon notice to the obligor and obligee, redirect payments for the support of any child receiving child support enforcement services either to the state of Connecticut or to the present custodial party, as their interests may appear, provided neither the obligor nor the obligee objects in writing within ten business days from the mailing date of such notice. Any such notice shall be sent by first class mail to the most recent address of such obligor and obligee, as recorded in the state case registry pursuant to section 46b-218 , and a copy of such notice shall be filed with the court or family support magistrate if both the obligor and obligee fail to object to the redirected payments within ten business days from the mailing date of such notice. All payments made shall be distributed as required by Title IV-D of the Social Security Act.",
              "(2) In addition, the court or family support magistrate shall include in each support order in a IV-D support case a provision for the health care coverage of the child. Such provision may include an order for either parent or both parents to provide such coverage under any or all of subparagraphs (A), (B) or (C) of this subdivision.",
              "(A) The provision for health care coverage may include an order for either parent to name any child as a beneficiary of any medical or dental insurance or benefit plan carried by such parent or available to such parent at a reasonable cost as described in subparagraph (D) of this subdivision. If such order requires the parent to maintain insurance available through an employer, the order shall be enforced using a National Medical Support Notice as provided in section 46b-88 .",
              "(B) The provision for health care coverage may include an order for either parent to: (i) Apply for and maintain coverage on behalf of the child under the HUSKY Plan, Part B; or (ii) provide cash medical support, as described in subparagraphs (E) and (F) of this subdivision. An order under this subparagraph shall be made only if the cost to the parent obligated to maintain coverage under the HUSKY Plan, Part B, or provide cash medical support is reasonable, as described in subparagraph (D) of this subdivision. An order under clause (i) of this subparagraph shall be made only if insurance coverage as described in subparagraph (A) of this subdivision is unavailable at reasonable cost to either parent, or inaccessible to the child.",
              "(C) An order for payment of the child's medical and dental expenses, other than those described in clause (ii) of subparagraph (E) of this subdivision, that are not covered by insurance or reimbursed in any other manner shall be entered in accordance with the child support guidelines established pursuant to section 46b-215a .",
              "(D) Health care coverage shall be deemed reasonable in cost if: (i) The parent obligated to maintain such coverage would qualify as a low-income obligor under the child support guidelines established pursuant to section 46b-215a , based solely on such parent's income, and the cost does not exceed five per cent of such parent's net income; or (ii) the parent obligated to maintain such coverage would not qualify as a low-income obligor under such guidelines and the cost does not exceed seven and one-half per cent of such parent's net income. In either case, net income shall be determined in accordance with the child support guidelines established pursuant to section 46b-215a . If a parent obligated to maintain insurance must obtain coverage for himself or herself to comply with the order to provide coverage for the child, reasonable cost shall be determined based on the combined cost of coverage for such parent and such child.",
              "(E) Cash medical support means (i) an amount ordered to be paid toward the cost of premiums for health insurance coverage provided by a public entity, including the HUSKY Plan, Part A or Part B, except as provided in subparagraph (F) of this subdivision, or by another parent through employment or otherwise, or (ii) an amount ordered to be paid, either directly to a medical provider or to the person obligated to pay such provider, toward any ongoing extraordinary medical and dental expenses of the child that are not covered by insurance or reimbursed in any other manner, provided such expenses are documented and identified (I) specifically on the record, or (II) in an affidavit, made under oath, that also states that no restraining order issued pursuant to section 46b-15 or protective order issued pursuant to section 46b-38c , between the parties is in effect or pending before the court. Cash medical support, as described in clauses (i) and (ii) of this subparagraph, may be ordered in lieu of an order under subparagraph (A) of this subdivision to be effective until such time as health insurance that is accessible to the child and reasonable in cost becomes available, or in addition to an order under subparagraph (A) of this subdivision, provided the total cost to the obligated parent of insurance and cash medical support is reasonable, as described in subparagraph (D) of this subdivision. An order for cash medical support shall be payable to the state or the custodial party, as their interests may appear, provided an order under clause (i) of this subparagraph shall be effective only as long as health insurance coverage is maintained. Any unreimbursed medical and dental expenses not covered by an order pursuant to clause (ii) of this subparagraph are subject to an order for unreimbursed medical and dental expenses pursuant to subparagraph (C) of this subdivision.",
              "(F) Cash medical support to offset the cost of any insurance payable under the HUSKY Plan, Part A or Part B, shall not be ordered against a noncustodial parent who is a low-income obligor, as defined in the child support guidelines established pursuant to section 46b-215a , or against a custodial parent of children covered under the HUSKY Plan, Part A or Part B.",
              "(3) The court or family support magistrate may also make and enforce orders for the payment by any person named herein of past-due support for which the defendant is liable in accordance with the provisions of section 17a-90 or 17b-81 , subsection (b) of section 17b-179 or section 17b-223 , 46b-129 or 46b-130 and, in IV-D cases, order such person, provided such person is not incapacitated, to participate in work activities which may include, but shall not be limited to, job search, training, work experience and participation in the job training and retraining program established by the Labor Commissioner pursuant to section 31-3t . The defendant's liability for past-due support under this subdivision shall be limited to the three years next preceding the filing of the petition.",
              "(4) If the defendant fails to comply with any order made under this section, the court or family support magistrate may commit the defendant to a community correctional center, there to remain until the defendant complies therewith; but, if it appears that the parent receiving support does not apply the periodic allowance paid by the defendant toward the support of such child, and that such child is chargeable, or likely to become chargeable, to the town where it belongs, the court, on application, may discontinue such allowance to the parent receiving support, and may direct such allowance to be paid to the selectmen of such town, for such support, and may issue execution in their favor for the same. The provisions of section 17b-743 shall apply to this section. The clerk of the court which has rendered judgment for the payment of money for the maintenance of any child under the provisions of this section shall, within twenty-four hours after such judgment has been rendered, notify the selectmen of the town where the child belongs.",
              "(5) Any support order made under this section may at any time thereafter be set aside, altered or modified by any court issuing such order upon a showing of a substantial change in the circumstances of the defendant or another parent of such child or upon a showing that such order substantially deviates from the child support guidelines established pursuant to section 46b-215a , unless there was a specific finding on the record at a hearing, or in a written judgment, order or memorandum of decision of the court, that the application of the guidelines would be inequitable or inappropriate. There shall be a rebuttable presumption that any deviation of less than fifteen per cent from the child support guidelines is not substantial and any deviation of fifteen per cent or more from the guidelines is substantial. No such support orders may be subject to retroactive modification, except that the court may order modification with respect to any period during which there is a pending motion for a modification of an existing support order from the date of service of the notice of such pending motion upon the opposing party pursuant to section 52-50 .",
              "(6) Failure of the defendant to obey any order for support made under this section may be punished as for contempt of court and the costs of commitment of any person imprisoned therefor shall be paid by the state as in criminal cases.",
              "(b) (1) Except as provided in subdivision (2) of this subsection, a judgment of parentage entered by the Superior Court or family support magistrate pursuant to this chapter may not be opened or set aside unless (A) a motion to open or set aside is filed not later than four months after the date on which the judgment was entered, and (B) upon a showing (i) of reasonable cause, or (ii) that a valid defense to the petition for a judgment of parentage existed, in whole or in part, at the time judgment was rendered, and the person seeking to open or set aside the judgment was prevented by mistake, accident or other reasonable cause from making a valid defense.",
              "(2) The Superior Court or a family support magistrate may consider a motion to open or set aside a judgment of parentage filed more than four months after such judgment was entered if such court or magistrate determines that the judgment was entered due to fraud, duress or material mistake of fact. The burden of proof shall be on the person seeking to open or set aside such judgment. If the court or family support magistrate determines such person has met the burden of proof under this subdivision, the judgment shall be set aside only if the court or family support magistrate determines that doing so is in the best interest of the child, based on the relevant factors set forth in section 46b-475 .",
              "(3) Whenever the Superior Court or family support magistrate opens a judgment of parentage entered pursuant to this section in which a person was found to be the parent of a child who is or has been supported by the state and the court or family support magistrate finds that the person adjudicated the parent is not the parent of the child, the Department of Social Services shall refund to such person any money paid to the state by such person during the period such child was supported by the state.",
              "(c) In IV-D support cases, as defined in subdivision (13) of subsection (b) of section 46b-231 , a copy of any support order established or modified pursuant to this section or, in the case of a motion for modification of an existing support order, a notice of determination that there should be no change in the amount of the support order, shall be provided to each party and the state case registry within fourteen days after issuance of such order or determination.",

            "text": "(a)(1)(A) If the defendant is found to be the parent of the child, the court or family support magistrate shall order the defendant to stand charged with the support and maintenance of such child, with the assistance of any other parent if such parent is financially able, as the court or family support magistrate finds, in accordance with the provisions of subsection (b) of section 17b-179 , or section 17a-90 , 17b-81 , 17b-223 , 17b-745 , 46b-129 , 46b-130 or 46b-215 , to be reasonably commensurate with the financial ability of the defendant, and to pay a certain sum periodically until the child attains the age of eighteen years or as otherwise provided in this subsection. If such child is unmarried and a full-time high school student, such support shall continue according to the parents' respective abilities, if such child is in need of support, until such child completes the twelfth grade or attains the age of nineteen, whichever occurs first.\n\n(B) The court or family support magistrate shall order the defendant to pay such sum to the complainant, or, if a town or the state has paid such expense, to the town or the state, as the case may be, and shall grant execution for the same and costs of suit taxed as in other civil actions, together with a reasonable attorney's fee, and may require the defendant to become bound with sufficient surety to perform such orders for support and maintenance. In IV-D support cases, the IV-D agency or a support enforcement agency under cooperative agreement with the IV-D agency may, upon notice to the obligor and obligee, redirect payments for the support of any child receiving child support enforcement services either to the state of Connecticut or to the present custodial party, as their interests may appear, provided neither the obligor nor the obligee objects in writing within ten business days from the mailing date of such notice. Any such notice shall be sent by first class mail to the most recent address of such obligor and obligee, as recorded in the state case registry pursuant to section 46b-218 , and a copy of such notice shall be filed with the court or family support magistrate if both the obligor and obligee fail to object to the redirected payments within ten business days from the mailing date of such notice. All payments made shall be distributed as required by Title IV-D of the Social Security Act.\n\n(2) In addition, the court or family support magistrate shall include in each support order in a IV-D support case a provision for the health care coverage of the child. Such provision may include an order for either parent or both parents to provide such coverage under any or all of subparagraphs (A), (B) or (C) of this subdivision.\n\n(A) The provision for health care coverage may include an order for either parent to name any child as a beneficiary of any medical or dental insurance or benefit plan carried by such parent or available to such parent at a reasonable cost as described in subparagraph (D) of this subdivision. If such order requires the parent to maintain insurance available through an employer, the order shall be enforced using a National Medical Support Notice as provided in section 46b-88 .\n\n(B) The provision for health care coverage may include an order for either parent to: (i) Apply for and maintain coverage on behalf of the child under the HUSKY Plan, Part B; or (ii) provide cash medical support, as described in subparagraphs (E) and (F) of this subdivision. An order under this subparagraph shall be made only if the cost to the parent obligated to maintain coverage under the HUSKY Plan, Part B, or provide cash medical support is reasonable, as described in subparagraph (D) of this subdivision. An order under clause (i) of this subparagraph shall be made only if insurance coverage as described in subparagraph (A) of this subdivision is unavailable at reasonable cost to either parent, or inaccessible to the child.\n\n(C) An order for payment of the child's medical and dental expenses, other than those described in clause (ii) of subparagraph (E) of this subdivision, that are not covered by insurance or reimbursed in any other manner shall be entered in accordance with the child support guidelines established pursuant to section 46b-215a .\n\n(D) Health care coverage shall be deemed reasonable in cost if: (i) The parent obligated to maintain such coverage would qualify as a low-income obligor under the child support guidelines established pursuant to section 46b-215a , based solely on such parent's income, and the cost does not exceed five per cent of such parent's net income; or (ii) the parent obligated to maintain such coverage would not qualify as a low-income obligor under such guidelines and the cost does not exceed seven and one-half per cent of such parent's net income. In either case, net income shall be determined in accordance with the child support guidelines established pursuant to section 46b-215a . If a parent obligated to maintain insurance must obtain coverage for himself or herself to comply with the order to provide coverage for the child, reasonable cost shall be determined based on the combined cost of coverage for such parent and such child.\n\n(E) Cash medical support means (i) an amount ordered to be paid toward the cost of premiums for health insurance coverage provided by a public entity, including the HUSKY Plan, Part A or Part B, except as provided in subparagraph (F) of this subdivision, or by another parent through employment or otherwise, or (ii) an amount ordered to be paid, either directly to a medical provider or to the person obligated to pay such provider, toward any ongoing extraordinary medical and dental expenses of the child that are not covered by insurance or reimbursed in any other manner, provided such expenses are documented and identified (I) specifically on the record, or (II) in an affidavit, made under oath, that also states that no restraining order issued pursuant to section 46b-15 or protective order issued pursuant to section 46b-38c , between the parties is in effect or pending before the court. Cash medical support, as described in clauses (i) and (ii) of this subparagraph, may be ordered in lieu of an order under subparagraph (A) of this subdivision to be effective until such time as health insurance that is accessible to the child and reasonable in cost becomes available, or in addition to an order under subparagraph (A) of this subdivision, provided the total cost to the obligated parent of insurance and cash medical support is reasonable, as described in subparagraph (D) of this subdivision. An order for cash medical support shall be payable to the state or the custodial party, as their interests may appear, provided an order under clause (i) of this subparagraph shall be effective only as long as health insurance coverage is maintained. Any unreimbursed medical and dental expenses not covered by an order pursuant to clause (ii) of this subparagraph are subject to an order for unreimbursed medical and dental expenses pursuant to subparagraph (C) of this subdivision.\n\n(F) Cash medical support to offset the cost of any insurance payable under the HUSKY Plan, Part A or Part B, shall not be ordered against a noncustodial parent who is a low-income obligor, as defined in the child support guidelines established pursuant to section 46b-215a , or against a custodial parent of children covered under the HUSKY Plan, Part A or Part B.\n\n(3) The court or family support magistrate may also make and enforce orders for the payment by any person named herein of past-due support for which the defendant is liable in accordance with the provisions of section 17a-90 or 17b-81 , subsection (b) of section 17b-179 or section 17b-223 , 46b-129 or 46b-130 and, in IV-D cases, order such person, provided such person is not incapacitated, to participate in work activities which may include, but shall not be limited to, job search, training, work experience and participation in the job training and retraining program established by the Labor Commissioner pursuant to section 31-3t . The defendant's liability for past-due support under this subdivision shall be limited to the three years next preceding the filing of the petition.\n\n(4) If the defendant fails to comply with any order made under this section, the court or family support magistrate may commit the defendant to a community correctional center, there to remain until the defendant complies therewith; but, if it appears that the parent receiving support does not apply the periodic allowance paid by the defendant toward the support of such child, and that such child is chargeable, or likely to become chargeable, to the town where it belongs, the court, on application, may discontinue such allowance to the parent receiving support, and may direct such allowance to be paid to the selectmen of such town, for such support, and may issue execution in their favor for the same. The provisions of section 17b-743 shall apply to this section. The clerk of the court which has rendered judgment for the payment of money for the maintenance of any child under the provisions of this section shall, within twenty-four hours after such judgment has been rendered, notify the selectmen of the town where the child belongs.\n\n(5) Any support order made under this section may at any time thereafter be set aside, altered or modified by any court issuing such order upon a showing of a substantial change in the circumstances of the defendant or another parent of such child or upon a showing that such order substantially deviates from the child support guidelines established pursuant to section 46b-215a , unless there was a specific finding on the record at a hearing, or in a written judgment, order or memorandum of decision of the court, that the application of the guidelines would be inequitable or inappropriate. There shall be a rebuttable presumption that any deviation of less than fifteen per cent from the child support guidelines is not substantial and any deviation of fifteen per cent or more from the guidelines is substantial. No such support orders may be subject to retroactive modification, except that the court may order modification with respect to any period during which there is a pending motion for a modification of an existing support order from the date of service of the notice of such pending motion upon the opposing party pursuant to section 52-50 .\n\n(6) Failure of the defendant to obey any order for support made under this section may be punished as for contempt of court and the costs of commitment of any person imprisoned therefor shall be paid by the state as in criminal cases.\n\n(b) (1) Except as provided in subdivision (2) of this subsection, a judgment of parentage entered by the Superior Court or family support magistrate pursuant to this chapter may not be opened or set aside unless (A) a motion to open or set aside is filed not later than four months after the date on which the judgment was entered, and (B) upon a showing (i) of reasonable cause, or (ii) that a valid defense to the petition for a judgment of parentage existed, in whole or in part, at the time judgment was rendered, and the person seeking to open or set aside the judgment was prevented by mistake, accident or other reasonable cause from making a valid defense.\n\n(2) The Superior Court or a family support magistrate may consider a motion to open or set aside a judgment of parentage filed more than four months after such judgment was entered if such court or magistrate determines that the judgment was entered due to fraud, duress or material mistake of fact. The burden of proof shall be on the person seeking to open or set aside such judgment. If the court or family support magistrate determines such person has met the burden of proof under this subdivision, the judgment shall be set aside only if the court or family support magistrate determines that doing so is in the best interest of the child, based on the relevant factors set forth in section 46b-475 .\n\n(3) Whenever the Superior Court or family support magistrate opens a judgment of parentage entered pursuant to this section in which a person was found to be the parent of a child who is or has been supported by the state and the court or family support magistrate finds that the person adjudicated the parent is not the parent of the child, the Department of Social Services shall refund to such person any money paid to the state by such person during the period such child was supported by the state.\n\n(c) In IV-D support cases, as defined in subdivision (13) of subsection (b) of section 46b-231 , a copy of any support order established or modified pursuant to this section or, in the case of a motion for modification of an existing support order, a notice of determination that there should be no change in the amount of the support order, shall be provided to each party and the state case registry within fourteen days after issuance of such order or determination.\n\nSee Sec. 46b-88 re National Medical Support Notice."

Not less than ten days prior to the date of the hearing on a claim for parentage, the Probate Court shall cause a certified copy of such claim and the notice of hearing under subsection (b) of this section to be served upon the birth parent of such child by personal service or service at the birth parent's usual place of abode, and to the Attorney General by first class mail. The Attorney General may file an appearance and shall be and remain a party to the action if the child is receiving or has received aid or care from the state, or if the child is receiving child support enforcement services, as defined in subdivision (2) of subsection (b) of section 46b-231 . The claim for parentage shall be admissible in any action for parentage under section 46b-560 , and shall estop the claimant from denying parentage of such child and shall contain language that such person acknowledges liability for contribution to the support and education of the child after the child's birth and for contribution to the pregnancy-related medical expenses of the birth parent.\n\n(b) If a claim for parentage is filed by the alleged genetic parent of any minor child born to an unmarried birth parent, the Probate Court shall schedule a hearing on such claim, send notice of the hearing to all parties involved and proceed accordingly.\n\n(c) The child shall be made a party to the action. If the child is a minor at the time of the proceedings, the minor child shall be represented by a guardian ad litem appointed by the Probate Court in accordance with section 45a-708 . Payment for the guardian ad litem shall be made in accordance with such section from funds appropriated to the Judicial Department, except that, if funds have not been included in the budget of the Judicial Department for such purposes, such payment shall be made from the Probate Court Administration Fund.\n\n(d) In the event that the birth parent or the alleged genetic parent is a minor, the Probate Court shall appoint a guardian ad litem to represent him or her in accordance with the provisions of section 45a-708 . Payment shall be made in accordance with said section from funds appropriated to the Judicial Department, except that, if funds have not been included in the budget of the Judicial Department for such purposes, such payment shall be made from the Probate Court Administration Fund.\n\n(e) By filing a claim under this section, the alleged genetic parent submits to the jurisdiction of the Probate Court.\n\n(f) Once parental rights of the alleged genetic parent have been adjudicated in such parent's favor under subsection (b) of this section, or acknowledged as provided for under sections 46b-476 to 46b-487 , inclusive, such parent's rights and responsibilities shall be equivalent to those of the birth parent, including those rights defined under section 45a-606 . Thereafter, disputes involving custody, visitation or support shall be transferred to the Superior Court under chapter 815j, except that the Probate Court may enter a temporary order for custody, visitation or support until an order is entered by the Superior Court.\n\n(g) Failing perfection of parental rights as prescribed by this section, any person claiming to be the alleged genetic parent of a child born to an unmarried birth parent (1) who has not been adjudicated the parent of such child by a court of competent jurisdiction, or (2) who has not acknowledged in writing that such person is the parent of such child, or (3) who has not contributed regularly to the support of such child, or (4) whose name does not appear on the birth certificate, shall cease to be a legal party in interest in any proceeding concerning the custody or welfare of the child, including, but not limited to, guardianship and adoption, unless such person has shown a reasonable degree of interest, concern or responsibility for the child's welfare.\n\n(h) Notwithstanding the provisions of this section, after the death of the alleged genetic parent of a child born to an unmarried birth parent, a party deemed by the Probate Court to have a sufficient interest may file a claim for parentage on behalf of such alleged genetic parent with the Probate Court for the district in which either the alleged genetic parent resided or the party filing the claim resides. If a claim for parentage is filed pursuant to this subsection, the Probate Court shall schedule a hearing on such claim, send notice of the hearing to all parties involved and proceed accordingly."
