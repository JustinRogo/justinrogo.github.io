In the year of a presidential preference primary, the registrars shall send such notice not earlier than the date of such primary. If the registrar does not receive the return card within thirty days after it is sent, the elector's name, including the name of an elector who has not voted in two consecutive federal elections, shall be placed on the inactive registry list for four years.

            "text": "(a) The registrars, on the Tuesday of the fifth week before each regular election, shall be in session for the purpose of completing a correct list of all electors who will be entitled to vote at such election. Such registry list shall consist of an active registry list and an inactive registry list. Such session shall be held during such hours between nine o'clock a.m. and five o'clock p.m. as the registrars find necessary to complete the list. Notice of such session shall be given at least five days before the session by publication in a newspaper having a circulation in such municipality, if any, and by posting on the signpost therein, if any, or at some other exterior place near the office of the town clerk. Such publication shall not be required to be in the form of a legal advertisement.\n\n(b) At such session and on any day except on the day of an election or primary, the registrars shall remove from the list the name of each elector who has died, who has been disfranchised or who has confirmed in writing that the elector has moved out of the municipality, except electors entitled to remain on such list under the provisions of this chapter. An elector shall be deemed to have confirmed in writing that the elector has moved out of the municipality if (1) the elector has submitted a change of address form for purposes of a state motor vehicle operator's license, unless the elector states on the form that the change of address is not for voter registration purposes, (2) the elector has submitted a change of address form to a voter registration agency, as defined in section 9-23n , and such agency has provided such change of address to the registrars of voters, or (3) the registrars of voters have received a cancellation of previous registration from any other election official indicating that such elector has registered as an elector outside such municipality.\n\n(c) Whenever the registrars of voters of a town remove from the registry list the name of an elector who has submitted a change of address to the Commissioner of Motor Vehicles or a voter registration agency under subdivision (1) or (2) of subsection (b) of this section, indicating that the elector has moved out of such town, the registrars shall send the elector, by forwardable mail to the elector's former address from such list or current address in the new town, (1) a notice of removal, (2) information explaining how to have the elector's name restored to such list, which shall be in a form prescribed by the Secretary of the State, and (3) a mail-in voter registration application which can be used by the elector to apply for admission as an elector in the new town. If such notice, information and application are sent to the elector's former address and are returned undeliverable, the registrars shall mail such documents to the elector's address in the new town.\n\n(d) The registrars shall enter the names on such list by street and number of the house, when the houses are numbered, so that there shall be entered on the list first, the street, avenue or road; second, the number of the house or residence in numerical order or, if the registrars of any town find it more convenient, by odd and even numbers in numerical order; and third, the names of the electors in such house in alphabetical order. The names of any electors who cannot be so listed shall be listed alphabetically in the voting district wherein any such elector is a bona fide resident. The registrars of voters may consecutively number the names on the registry list, may include voter identification numbers for the names on the registry list, and may include a mark, as prescribed by the Secretary of the State, next to the name of each first-time registrant on the system who registers to vote on or after January 1, 2003, and does not provide identification with his or her mail-in voter registration application as provided in the Help America Vote Act, P.L. 107-252, as amended from time to time, provided such list shall comply in all respects with the requirements of law other than for the addition of such numbers and marks. The registrars shall not use Social Security numbers for any such voter identification numbers.\n\n(e) In any case in which the registrars have obtained reliable information of an elector's change of address within the municipality, the registrars shall enter the name of such elector on the registry list at the place where the elector then resides, provided, if such reliable information is the National Change of Address System of the United States Postal Service, the registrar shall change the registry list and send the elector a notice of the change by forwardable mail and a postage prepaid preaddressed return form by which the elector may verify or correct the address information. If during the canvass the registrars determine that an elector has moved out of the municipality and such elector has not confirmed in writing that the elector has moved out of the municipality, the registrars shall, not later than May first, send to the elector, by forwardable mail, a notice required by the National Voter Registration Act of 1993, P.L. 103-31, as amended from time to time, together with a postage prepaid preaddressed return card on which the elector may state the elector's current address. In the year of a presidential preference primary, the registrars shall send such notice not earlier than the date of such primary. If the registrar does not receive the return card within thirty days after it is sent, the elector's name, including the name of an elector who has not voted in two consecutive federal elections, shall be placed on the inactive registry list for four years. At the expiration of such period of time on the inactive registry list, such name shall be removed from the registry list. If such elector applies to restore the elector's name to the active registry list or votes during such period, the elector's name shall be restored to the active registry list. Such registrars shall retain a duplicate copy or record of each such notice in their office or, if the registrars do not have a permanent office, in the office space provided under section 9-5a , and shall note on such duplicate copy or record the date on which such notice was mailed. In each municipality, any elector, upon change of residence within the municipality, may cause the elector's registration to be transferred to the elector's new address by presenting to the registrars a new application for voter registration. The registrars shall thereupon enter the elector's name on the list at the elector's new residence; provided no transfer of registration shall be made on the registry list on election day without the consent of each registrar.\n\nSee Secs. 54-240g and 54-240k re confidentiality of address of participant in address confidentiality program."

Such challenge may be made, and notice thereof sent, at any time except for the period of five weeks before any regular election to be held in such municipality.

(insert name of town) now registered at .... (insert name of street, and number, if any) do hereby state under oath that I maintain a place of abode at .... (insert name of street, and number, if any) within such town; that my absence is temporary from said town for the following reasons: ....; that it is my present intention to maintain a domicile and residence in said town and return thereto whenever the necessity for temporary absence has ceased; that I am not now registered elsewhere as an elector nor have I any present intention so to register.\n\n....

Otherwise, the name of such elector shall be placed on the inactive registry list for four years and then removed from the registry list. All applications herein provided for shall be kept by the registrars as a permanent record; and, when no application for retention of his electoral privilege is received from any elector whose right to have his name retained on the registry list is challenged under the provisions of this section, the registrars shall keep as a permanent record evidence that the notice required by this section has been sent in the manner provided herein."

The clerk shall instead deliver such ballot or ballots to the registrars of voters or their designees who will supervise the voting of such ballots in accordance with this section.\n\n(e) Except in the case of a written refusal as provided in subsection (b) of this section, upon receipt of a request for supervision of absentee balloting during the period set forth in subsection (c) of this section, the registrar or registrars of voters who received the request shall inform the registrar or administrator who made the request and the town clerk as to the date and time when such supervision shall occur, which shall be the date and time contained in the request or the alternate date and time contained in the request. If the registrar or registrars fail to select either date, the supervision shall take place on the date and time contained in the request. If a request for supervision of absentee balloting at an institution is filed during the period set forth in subsection (c) of this section and the town clerk receives an application for an absentee ballot from a patient in the institution after the date when supervised balloting occurred, either registrar of voters may request, in writing, to the appropriate town clerk and registrars of voters that the supervision of the voting of absentee ballots at such institution in accordance with this section be repeated, and in such case the registrars or their designees shall supervise absentee balloting at such institution on the date and at the time specified in the subsequent request, which shall be not later than the last business day before the election or primary.\n\n(f) On the date when the supervision of absentee balloting at any institution is to occur, the town clerk shall deliver to the registrars or their designees the absentee ballots and envelopes for all applicants who are electors of such clerk's town and patients at such institution. The ballot and envelopes shall be prepared for delivery to the applicant as provided in sections 9-137 to 9-140a , inclusive. The registrars or their designees shall furnish the town clerk a written receipt for such ballots.\n\n(g) The registrars or their designees, as the case may be, shall jointly deliver the ballots to the respective applicants at the institution and shall jointly supervise the voting of such ballots. The ballots shall be returned to the registrars or their designees by the electors in the envelopes provided and in accordance with the provisions of sections 9-137 , 9-139 and 9-140a . If any elector asks for assistance in voting his ballot, two registrars or their designees of different political parties or, for a primary, their designees of different candidates, shall render such assistance as they deem necessary and appropriate to enable such elector to vote his ballot. The registrars or their designees may reject a ballot when (1) the elector declines to vote a ballot, or (2) the registrars or their designees are unable to determine how the elector who has requested their assistance desires to vote the ballot. When the registrars or their designees reject a ballot, they shall mark the serially-numbered outer envelope “rejected” and note the reasons for rejection. Nothing in this section shall limit the right of an elector to vote his ballot in secret.\n\n(h) After all ballots have been voted or marked “rejected” in accordance with subsection (g) of this section, the registrars or their designees shall jointly deliver or mail them in the envelopes, which shall be sealed, to the appropriate town clerk, who shall retain them until delivered in accordance with section 9-140c .\n\n(i) When an institution is located in a town having a primary, the registrar in that town of the party holding the primary shall appoint for each such institution, one designee of the party-endorsed candidates and one designee of the contestants from the lists, if any, submitted by the party-endorsed candidates and contestants. Such registrar shall notify all party-endorsed candidates and all contestants of their right to submit a list of potential designees under this section. Each party-endorsed candidate and each contestant may submit to such registrar in writing a list of names of potential designees, provided any such list shall be submitted not later than ten days before the primary. If no such lists are submitted within said period, such registrar shall appoint one designee of the party-endorsed candidates and one designee of the contestants. Each designee appointed pursuant to this section shall be sworn to the faithful performance of his duties, and the registrar shall file a certificate of each designation with his town clerk.\n\n(j) Any registrar of voters who has filed a request that the absentee balloting at an institution be supervised and any registrar required to conduct a supervision of voting under this section, who neglects to perform any of the duties required of him by this section so as to cause any elector to lose his vote shall be guilty of a class A misdemeanor. Any registrar from the same town as a registrar who has filed such a request may waive his right to participate in the supervision of absentee balloting.\n\n(k) Notwithstanding any provision of this section, if the spouse or a child of a registrar of voters or a dependent relative residing in the registrar's household is a candidate in the election or primary for which supervised absentee voting is to occur, such registrar shall not supervise such absentee voting but may designate the deputy registrar of voters or an assistant registrar of voters, appointed by the registrar pursuant to section 9-192 , to supervise the absentee voting in his place.\n\n(l) Notwithstanding any provision of the general statutes, the Secretary of the State may suspend the supervision of absentee balloting under this section and section 9-159r , provided the Secretary (1) suspends such supervision of absentee balloting in recognition of a declaration by the Governor of a civil preparedness emergency, pursuant to section 28-9 , or a public health emergency, pursuant to section 19-131a , and (2) submits a report, in accordance with section 11-4a , to the joint standing committee of the General Assembly having cognizance of matters relating to elections advising of such suspension and specifying alternative actions to be taken to provide opportunities for absentee voting by electors described in this section and section 9-159r ."

The elector shall place the early voting ballot in the early voting ballot envelope provided and deposit such envelope in a secured early voting ballot depository receptacle. At the conclusion of each day during the early voting period, the registrars of voters shall transport such receptacle containing such day's early voting ballots to the municipal clerk, who shall retain and securely store such ballots in as near a manner as possible to that for the retention and secure storage of absentee ballots, as provided in subsection (g) of this section, except that, if such manner is not practicable, then such early voting ballots shall be retained and securely stored as provided in an alternate plan submitted by the registrars of voters to the Secretary of the State and approved by the Secretary.

At the conclusion of each day during the early voting period, the registrars of voters shall transport such receptacle containing such day's early voting ballots to the municipal clerk, who shall retain and securely store such ballots in as near a manner as possible to that for the retention and secure storage of absentee ballots, as provided in subsection (g) of this section, except that, if such manner is not practicable, then such early voting ballots shall be retained and securely stored as provided in an alternate plan submitted by the registrars of voters to the Secretary of the State and approved by the Secretary. On the day of the election or primary, the early voting ballots shall be delivered to the registrars of voters for the purpose of counting such ballots. A section of the head moderator's return shall show the number of early voting ballots received from electors. The registrars of voters shall seal a copy of the vote tally for early voting ballots in a depository envelope with the early voting ballots and store such early voting depository envelope with the other election or primary results materials.

The Secretary shall certify each person who successfully completes an instructional session or regional instructional session, as the case may be, conducted in accordance with the provisions of subsection (b) of this section and an examination administered by the Secretary, as eligible to serve as moderator or alternate moderator at any election or primary held during the time such certification is effective, except the Secretary shall not certify any person as moderator or alternate moderator who has been convicted of or pled guilty or nolo contendere to, in a court of competent jurisdiction, any felony involving fraud, forgery, larceny, embezzlement or bribery or any criminal offense under this title. Before July 1, 2019, (1) any initial certification granted under this subsection shall expire two years after the date of its granting, and (2) prior to expiration of an initial or subsequent certification, a moderator or alternate moderator may undergo an abridged recertification process prescribed by the Secretary, and upon successful completion thereof, such certification shall be renewed for two years after the date of such completion. On and after July 1, 2019, (A) any initial certification granted under this subsection shall expire four years after the date of its granting, and (B) prior to expiration of an initial or subsequent certification, a moderator or alternate moderator may undergo an abridged recertification process prescribed by the Secretary, and upon successful completion thereof, such certification shall be renewed for four years after the date of such completion.

The Secretary of the State may adopt regulations, in accordance with the provisions of chapter 54, as the Secretary deems necessary to implement the certification process under this section.\n\n(d) If the person designated as moderator is unable to serve for any reason, a certified alternate moderator shall serve as moderator. If such certified alternate moderator is not called upon to serve as moderator, he shall serve in another capacity as an election official on election or primary day. If any town or voting district lacks a moderator due to the death, disability or withdrawal of a certified moderator or alternate moderator, or due to the disqualification of a moderator for any reason, including failure to attend an instructional session as required by this section, the registrars of voters shall appoint a new moderator for such town or voting district in the manner provided in this section. Such new moderator shall attend an instructional session and a certification session conducted in accordance with the provisions of this section. If all such sessions have been conducted at the time of appointment of the new moderator, the new moderator shall receive instruction from the registrars who appointed the new moderator.\n\nSee Sec. 9-249 re instruction of election officials in use of voting tabulator."

For any result under subdivision (3) of this subsection that is a fractional number, the head moderator shall round such result to the nearest whole number, provided a half number shall be rounded to the next highest whole number, and provided further that each such endorsing party with a percentage greater than zero under subdivision (1) of this subsection shall receive at least one such vote, with the remaining parties receiving a proportional reduction in votes, if necessary. If any vote remains that can not be evenly attributed to such parties, such vote shall be attributed to the endorsing party with the most votes.\n\n(c) Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (b) of this section, the Secretary of the State may approve a voting tabulator which requires the elector in the polls to place the elector's ballot into the recording device and which meets the voluntary performance and test standards for voting systems adopted by (1) the Federal Election Commission on January 25, 1990, as amended from time to time, or (2) the Election Assistance Commission pursuant to the Help America Vote Act of 2002, P.L. 107-252, 42 USC 15481-85, as amended from time to time, whichever standards are most current at the time of the Secretary of the State's approval, and regulations which the Secretary of the State may adopt in accordance with the provisions of chapter 54, provided the voting tabulator shall (A) warn the elector of overvotes, (B) not record overvotes, and (C) not record more than one vote of an elector for the same person for an office. In the event that a candidate is cross endorsed and an elector casts more than one vote for such candidate, such vote shall be attributed by the head moderator to the endorsing parties as provided for in this subsection. The head moderator shall (i) determine the percentage of all attributable votes the candidate received that are attributable to each endorsing party, (ii) determine the number of ballots upon which an elector voted for the candidate more than once, and (iii) apply the percentage determined under subparagraph (C)(i) of this subsection for an endorsing party to the total determined under subparagraph (C)(ii) of this subsection. The resulting number from the calculation under subparagraph (C)(iii) of this subsection shall be the number of votes the head moderator attributes to the endorsing party associated with the percentage used in the calculation under subparagraph (C)(iii) of this subsection. The head moderator shall repeat the calculation in subparagraph (C)(iii) of this subsection for each endorsing party. For any result under subparagraph (C)(iii) of this subsection that is a fractional number, the head moderator shall round such result to the nearest whole number, provided a half number shall be rounded to the next highest whole number, and provided further that each such endorsing party with a percentage greater than zero under subparagraph (C)(i) of this subsection shall receive at least one such vote, with the remaining parties receiving a proportional reduction in votes, if necessary. If any vote remains that can not be evenly attributed to such parties, such vote shall be attributed to the endorsing party with the most votes.\n\n(d) Any direct recording electronic voting tabulator approved by the Secretary of the State for an election or primary held on or after July 1, 2005, shall be so constructed as to:\n\n(1) (A) Contemporaneously produce an individual, permanent, paper record containing all of the elector's selections of ballot preferences for candidates and questions or proposals, if any, prior to the elector's casting a ballot, as set forth in this subsection, and (B) produce at any time after the close of the polls a voting tabulator generated, individual, permanent, paper record of each such elector's selections of ballot preferences for candidates and questions or proposals, if any. Both the contemporaneously produced paper record and the voting tabulator generated paper record of each elector's selections of ballot preferences shall include a voting tabulator generated unique identifier that can be matched against each other and which preserves the secrecy of the elector's ballot as set forth in subdivision (4) of this subsection;\n\n(2) Provide each elector with an opportunity to verify that the contemporaneously produced, individual, permanent, paper record accurately conforms to such elector's selection of ballot preferences, as reflected on the electronic summary screen, and to hear, if desired, an audio description of such electronic summary screen, for the purpose of having an opportunity to make any corrections or changes prior to casting the ballot. If an elector makes corrections or changes prior to casting the ballot, the voting tabulator shall void such contemporaneously produced paper record, contemporaneously produce another paper record containing such corrections or changes and provide the elector with another opportunity to verify ballot preferences in accordance with the provisions of this subdivision. As used in this section, “electronic summary screen” means a screen generated by a direct recording electronic voting tabulator that displays a summary of an elector's selections of ballot preferences for candidates and questions or proposals, if any, at an election or primary;\n\n(3) Provide that a ballot shall be deemed cast on the voting tabulator at the time that an elector's contemporaneously produced, individual, permanent, voter-verified paper record, containing all of the elector's final selections of ballot preferences, is (A) deposited inside a receptacle designed to store all such paper records produced by such voting tabulator on the day of the election or primary, and (B) the elector's selection of ballot preferences is simultaneously electronically recorded inside the voting tabulator for the purpose of (i) being electronically tabulated immediately after the polls are closed on the day of the election or primary, and (ii) producing, on such other day as required under section 9-242b , a voting tabulator generated, individual, permanent, paper record of each such elector's selections of ballot preferences for candidates and questions or proposals, if any;\n\n(4) Except as otherwise provided in subdivision (1) of section 9-242b , secure the secrecy of each such elector's ballot by making it impossible for any other individual to identify the elector in relationship to such elector's selection of ballot preferences at the time that the elector (A) selects ballot preferences; (B) verifies the accuracy of the electronic summary screen by comparing it to the contemporaneously produced, individual, permanent, paper record or the audio description of such electronic summary screen, prior to casting a ballot; (C) makes corrections or changes by reselecting ballot preferences and verifies the accuracy of such preferences in accordance with the provisions of subdivision (2) of this subsection prior to casting a ballot; and (D) casts the ballot; and at the time that all electors' ballots are canvassed, recanvassed or otherwise tallied to produce a final count of the vote for candidates and questions or proposals, if any, whether through the electronic vote tabulation process or through the manual count process of each elector's contemporaneously produced, individual, permanent, voter-verified paper record, as set forth in section 9-242b ; and\n\n(5) (A) Be accessible to blind or visually impaired persons by providing each elector, if desired by the elector, an audio description of the contemporaneously produced individual, permanent, paper record containing all of the elector's selections of ballot preferences, in addition to an audio description of the electronic summary screen and comply with such additional standards of accessibility included in regulations that the Secretary of the State may adopt in accordance with the provisions of chapter 54.\n\n(B) Notwithstanding the provisions of subparagraph (A) of this subdivision, on or before June 30, 2007, the Secretary of the State may approve an electronic voting tabulator that does not comply with the provisions of said subparagraph if (i) the Secretary determines that there are no electronic voting tabulators available for purchase or lease at the time of such approval that are capable of complying with said subparagraph (A), (ii) the electronic voting tabulator complies with the provisions of subdivisions (1) to (4), inclusive, of this subsection, and (iii) the person applying to the Secretary for approval of the electronic voting tabulator agrees to include a provision in any contract for the sale or lease of such voting tabulators that requires such person, upon notification by the Secretary that modifications to such tabulators that would bring the tabulators into compliance with said subparagraph (A) are available, to (I) so modify any electronic voting tabulators previously sold or leased under such contract in order to comply with said subparagraph (A), and (II) provide that any electronic voting tabulators sold or leased after receipt of such notice comply with said subparagraph (A). No voting tabulator approved under this subparagraph shall be used on or after July 1, 2007, unless it has been modified to comply with the provisions of subparagraph (A) of this subdivision."

              "The following procedures shall apply to any election or primary in which one or more direct recording electronic voting tabulators are used:",
              "(1) Any elector who requires assistance by reason of blindness, disability, or inability to read or write shall have the right to request assistance inside the voting booth by a person of the elector's choice in accordance with 42 USC 1973aa-6, as amended from time to time, or section 9-264 .",
              "(2) A canvass of the votes shall take place inside the polling place immediately following the close of the polls on the day of the election or primary in accordance with the requirements of chapter 148. With respect to direct recording electronic voting tabulators, any such canvass shall be an electronic vote tabulation of all of the votes cast on each such voting tabulator for each candidate and question or proposal, and the moderator shall attach a printout of such electronic vote tabulation to the tally sheets. The moderator shall then add together all of the votes recorded on each voting tabulator in use at the polling place, whether or not such voting tabulators were direct recording electronic voting tabulators, to produce a cumulative count within the polling place of all candidates and any questions or proposals appearing on the ballot in the election or primary. Any member of the public shall have a right to be present in the polling place to observe the canvass of the votes beginning as soon as the polls are declared closed by the moderator and continuing throughout the canvass of the votes of each voting tabulator until the final canvass of all of the votes cast on all of the voting tabulators in use in the polling place are added together for each candidate and question or proposal and publicly announced and declared by the moderator.",
              "(3) If a recanvass of the votes is required pursuant to chapter 148, the recanvass officials shall, in addition to the other requirements of said chapter, conduct a manual tally of the individual, permanent, voter-verified, paper records contemporaneously produced by each direct recording electronic voting tabulator used within the geographical jurisdiction that is subject to such recanvass. The manual tally conducted for the recanvass shall be limited to the particular candidates and questions or proposals that are subject to recanvass. If the manual tabulation of such contemporaneously produced paper records does not reconcile with the electronic vote tabulation of a particular direct recording electronic voting tabulator or tabulators, such contemporaneously produced paper records shall be considered the true and correct record of each elector's vote on such electronic voting tabulator or tabulators and shall be used as the official record for purposes of declaring the official election results or for purposes of any subsequent recanvass, tally or election contest conducted pursuant to chapters 148 to 153, inclusive. If any of the contemporaneously produced individual, permanent, voter-verified paper records are found to have been damaged in such manner as they are unable to be manually tallied with respect to the ballot positions that are the subject of the recanvass, each such damaged record shall be matched against the voting tabulator generated, individual, permanent, paper record produced by the voting tabulator bearing the identical tabulator-generated unique identifier as the damaged record and, in such instance, shall be substituted as the official record for purposes of determining the final election results or for purposes of any subsequent recanvass, tally or election contest.",
              "(4) Notwithstanding the provisions of section 9-311 , the Secretary of the State may order a discrepancy recanvass under said section of the returns of an election or a primary for a district office, a state office or the office of elector of President and Vice-President of the United States, if the Secretary has reason to believe that discrepancies may have occurred that could affect the outcome of the election or primary. Any such discrepancy recanvass may be conducted of the returns in any or all voting districts in (A) the district in which an election or primary is held, in the case of an election or primary for a district office, or (B) the state, in the case of an election or primary for a state office or the office of elector of President and Vice-President of the United States or a presidential preference primary, whichever is applicable. As used in this subdivision, “district office” and “state office” have the same meanings as provided in section 9-372 .",
              "(5) Not later than five business days after each election in which a direct recording electronic voting tabulator is used, the registrars of voters or their designees, representing at least two political parties, shall conduct a manual audit of the votes recorded on at least (A) two direct recording electronic voting tabulators used in each assembly district, or (B) a number of direct recording electronic voting tabulators equal to fifty per cent of the number of voting districts in the municipality, whichever is less. Not later than five business days after a primary in which a direct recording electronic voting tabulator is used, the registrar of voters of the party holding the primary shall conduct such a manual audit by designating two or more individuals, one of whom may be the registrar, representing at least two candidates in the primary. The tabulators audited under this subdivision shall be selected in a random drawing that is announced in advance to the public and is open to the public. All direct recording electronic voting tabulators used within an assembly district shall have an equal chance of being selected for the audit. The Secretary of the State shall determine and publicly announce the method of conducting the random drawing, before the election. The manual audit shall consist of a manual tabulation of the contemporaneously produced, individual, permanent, voter-verified, paper records produced by each voting tabulator subject to the audit and a comparison of such count, with respect to all candidates and any questions or proposals appearing on the ballot, with the electronic vote tabulation reported for such voting tabulator on the day of the election or primary. Such audit shall not be required if a recanvass has been, or will be, conducted on the voting tabulator. Such manual audit shall be noticed in advance and be open to public observation. A reconciliation sheet, on a form prescribed by the Secretary of the State, that reports and compares the manual and electronic vote tabulations of each candidate and question or proposal on each such voting tabulator, along with any discrepancies, shall be prepared by the audit officials, signed and forthwith filed with the town clerk of the municipality and the Secretary of the State. If any contemporaneously produced, individual, permanent, voter-verified, paper record is found to have been damaged, the same procedures described in subdivision (3) of this section for substituting such record with the voting tabulator generated, individual, permanent, paper record produced by the voting tabulator bearing the identical tabulator generated unique identifier as the damaged record shall apply and be utilized by the audit officials to complete the reconciliation. The reconciliation sheet shall be open to public inspection and may be used as prima facie evidence of a discrepancy in any contest arising pursuant to chapter 149. If the audit officials are unable to reconcile the manual count with the electronic vote tabulation and discrepancies, the Secretary of the State shall conduct such further investigation of the voting tabulator malfunction as may be necessary for the purpose of reviewing whether or not to decertify the voting tabulator or tabulators and may order a recanvass in accordance with the provisions of subdivision (4) of this section.",
              "(6) The individual, permanent, voter-verified, paper records contemporaneously produced by any direct recording electronic voting tabulator in use at an election or primary held on or after July 1, 2005, shall be carefully preserved and returned in their designated receptacle in accordance with the requirements of section 9-266 or 9-310 , whichever is applicable, and may not be opened or destroyed, except during recanvass or manual audit as set forth in this section, for one hundred eighty days following an election or primary that does not include a federal office, pursuant to section 9-310 , or for twenty-two months following an election or primary involving a federal office, pursuant to 42 USC 1974, as amended from time to time.",
              "(7) Nothing in this section shall preclude any candidate or elector from seeking additional remedies pursuant to chapter 149.",
              "(8) After an election or primary, any voting tabulator may be kept locked for a period longer than that prescribed by sections 9-266 , 9-310 and 9-447 , if such an extended period is ordered by either a court of competent jurisdiction or the State Elections Enforcement Commission. Either the court or said commission may order an audit of such voting tabulators to be conducted by such persons as the court or said commission may designate."

Such written notice shall require the clerk or registrars of voters, as the case may be, to bring with them the depository envelopes required by section 9-150a , the package of write-in ballots provided for in section 9-310 , the absentee ballot applications, the list of absentee ballot applications, the registry list and the moderators' returns and shall require such recanvass officials to meet at a specified time not later than the fifth business day after such election to recanvass the returns of a voting tabulator or voting tabulators or absentee ballots or write-in ballots used in such district in such election. If any of such recanvass officials are unavailable at the time of the recanvass, the registrar of voters of the same political party as that of the recanvass official unable to attend shall designate another elector having previous training and experience in the conduct of elections to take his place. Before such recanvass is made, such moderator shall give notice, in writing, to the chairperson of the town committee of each political party which nominated candidates for the election, and, in the case of a state election, not later than twenty-four hours after a determination is made regarding the need for a recanvass to the Secretary of the State, of the time and place where such recanvass is to be made; and each such chairperson may send party representatives to be present at such recanvass. Such party representatives may observe, but no one other than a recanvass official may take part in the recanvass. If any irregularity in the recanvass procedure is noted by such a party representative, he shall be permitted to present evidence of such irregularity in any contest relating to the election.",
              "(b) The moderator shall determine the place or places where the recanvass shall be conducted and, if such recanvass is held before the tabulators are boxed and collected in the manner required by section 9-266 , the moderator may either require that such recanvass of such tabulators be conducted in each place where the tabulators are located, or he may require that they be removed to one central place, where such recanvass shall be conducted. All recanvassing procedures shall be open to public observation, subject to the provisions of subsection (d) of this section. Such recanvass officials shall, in the presence of such moderator and registrars of voters, make a record of the number on the seal and the number on the protective counter, if one is provided, on each voting tabulator specified by such moderator. Such registrars of voters in the presence of such moderator shall turn over the keys of each such tabulator to such recanvass officials, and such recanvass officials, in the presence of such registrars of voters and moderator, shall immediately proceed to recanvass the vote cast thereon, and shall then open the package of absentee ballots and recanvass the vote cast thereon. In the course of the recanvass of the absentee ballot vote the recanvass officials shall check all outer envelopes for absentee ballots against the inner envelopes for such ballots and against the registry list to verify postmarks, addresses and registry list markings and also to determine whether the number of envelopes from which absentee ballots have been removed is the same as the number of persons checked as having voted by absentee ballot. The write-in ballots shall also be recanvassed at this time. Any party representative present shall have a right to view each ballot as it is being recanvassed by the recanvass officials, so as to be able to discern the markings on such ballot. All of the recanvass officials shall use the same forms for tallies and returns as were used at the original canvass and the absentee ballot counters shall also sign the tallies.",

The write-in ballots shall be replaced in a properly secured sealed package. Upon the completion of such recanvass, any tabulator used in such recanvass shall be locked and sealed, the keys thereof shall immediately be returned to such registrars of voters and such tabulator shall remain so locked until the expiration of fourteen days after such election or for such longer period as is ordered by a court of competent jurisdiction. The absentee ballots shall be replaced in their wrappers and be resealed by the moderator in the presence of the recanvass officials. Upon the completion of such recanvass, such moderator and at least two of the recanvass officials of different political parties shall forthwith prepare and sign such return forms which shall contain a written statement giving the result of such recanvass for each tabulator and each package of absentee ballots whose returns were so recanvassed, setting forth whether or not the original canvass was correctly made and stating whether or not the discrepancy still remains unaccounted for. Such return forms containing such statement shall forthwith be filed by the moderator in the office of such clerk. If such recanvass reveals that the original canvass of returns was not correctly made, such return forms containing such statement so filed with the clerk shall constitute a corrected return. In the case of a state election, a recanvass return shall be made in duplicate on a form prescribed and provided by the Secretary of the State, and the moderator shall file one copy with the Secretary of the State and one copy with the town clerk not later than ten days after the election. Such recanvass return shall be substituted for the original return and shall have the same force and effect as an original return.",

Such written notice shall require the clerk or registrars of voters, as the case may be, to bring with them the depository envelopes required by section 9-150a , the package of write-in ballots provided for in section 9-310 , the absentee ballot applications, the list of absentee ballot applications, the registry list and the moderators' returns and shall require such recanvass officials to meet at a specified time not later than the fifth business day after such election to recanvass the returns of a voting tabulator or voting tabulators or absentee ballots or write-in ballots used in such district in such election. If any of such recanvass officials are unavailable at the time of the recanvass, the registrar of voters of the same political party as that of the recanvass official unable to attend shall designate another elector having previous training and experience in the conduct of elections to take his place. Before such recanvass is made, such moderator shall give notice, in writing, to the chairperson of the town committee of each political party which nominated candidates for the election, and, in the case of a state election, not later than twenty-four hours after a determination is made regarding the need for a recanvass to the Secretary of the State, of the time and place where such recanvass is to be made; and each such chairperson may send party representatives to be present at such recanvass. Such party representatives may observe, but no one other than a recanvass official may take part in the recanvass. If any irregularity in the recanvass procedure is noted by such a party representative, he shall be permitted to present evidence of such irregularity in any contest relating to the election.\n\n(b) The moderator shall determine the place or places where the recanvass shall be conducted and, if such recanvass is held before the tabulators are boxed and collected in the manner required by section 9-266 , the moderator may either require that such recanvass of such tabulators be conducted in each place where the tabulators are located, or he may require that they be removed to one central place, where such recanvass shall be conducted. All recanvassing procedures shall be open to public observation, subject to the provisions of subsection (d) of this section. Such recanvass officials shall, in the presence of such moderator and registrars of voters, make a record of the number on the seal and the number on the protective counter, if one is provided, on each voting tabulator specified by such moderator. Such registrars of voters in the presence of such moderator shall turn over the keys of each such tabulator to such recanvass officials, and such recanvass officials, in the presence of such registrars of voters and moderator, shall immediately proceed to recanvass the vote cast thereon, and shall then open the package of absentee ballots and recanvass the vote cast thereon. In the course of the recanvass of the absentee ballot vote the recanvass officials shall check all outer envelopes for absentee ballots against the inner envelopes for such ballots and against the registry list to verify postmarks, addresses and registry list markings and also to determine whether the number of envelopes from which absentee ballots have been removed is the same as the number of persons checked as having voted by absentee ballot. The write-in ballots shall also be recanvassed at this time. Any party representative present shall have a right to view each ballot as it is being recanvassed by the recanvass officials, so as to be able to discern the markings on such ballot. All of the recanvass officials shall use the same forms for tallies and returns as were used at the original canvass and the absentee ballot counters shall also sign the tallies.\n\n(c) The votes shall be announced and recorded in the manner prescribed in section 9-309 on return forms provided by the registrars of voters and appended thereto shall be a statement signed by the moderator indicating the time and place of the recanvass and the names, addresses, titles and party affiliations of the recanvass officials. The write-in ballots shall be replaced in a properly secured sealed package. Upon the completion of such recanvass, any tabulator used in such recanvass shall be locked and sealed, the keys thereof shall immediately be returned to such registrars of voters and such tabulator shall remain so locked until the expiration of fourteen days after such election or for such longer period as is ordered by a court of competent jurisdiction. The absentee ballots shall be replaced in their wrappers and be resealed by the moderator in the presence of the recanvass officials. Upon the completion of such recanvass, such moderator and at least two of the recanvass officials of different political parties shall forthwith prepare and sign such return forms which shall contain a written statement giving the result of such recanvass for each tabulator and each package of absentee ballots whose returns were so recanvassed, setting forth whether or not the original canvass was correctly made and stating whether or not the discrepancy still remains unaccounted for. Such return forms containing such statement shall forthwith be filed by the moderator in the office of such clerk. If such recanvass reveals that the original canvass of returns was not correctly made, such return forms containing such statement so filed with the clerk shall constitute a corrected return. In the case of a state election, a recanvass return shall be made in duplicate on a form prescribed and provided by the Secretary of the State, and the moderator shall file one copy with the Secretary of the State and one copy with the town clerk not later than ten days after the election. Such recanvass return shall be substituted for the original return and shall have the same force and effect as an original return.\n\n(d) The moderator may, when any disorder arises that interferes with the conduct of a recanvass, including any attempt by a person other than a recanvass official to take part in such recanvass or by such a person to communicate with a recanvass official other than the moderator, and the offender refuses to submit to the moderator's lawful authority, order that the offender be removed by the recanvass officials from such recanvass until the offender conforms to order or, if need be, until such recanvass is completed.\n\n(e) As used in this section, (1) “moderator” means, in the case of municipalities not divided into voting districts, the moderator of the election and, in the case of municipalities divided into voting districts, the head moderator of the election, and (2) “registrars of voters”, in a municipality where there are different registrars of voters for different voting districts, means the registrars of voters in the voting district in which, at the last-preceding election, the presiding officer for the purpose of declaring the result of the vote of the whole municipality was moderator.\n\nSee Sec. 1-2a re construction of references to “United States mail”, “postmark” or “registered or certified mail”."

When election statute mandates certain procedures, and election official has failed to apply or to follow those procedures, such conduct implicitly constitutes an incorrect interpretation of requirements of statute and, therefore, is a ruling of an election official; ordinary rules of evidence apply in election contests; there is no special obligation for a court to exercise its discretion in favor of admitting evidence. 285 C. 618. Before a court is able to ascertain whether there was any official action that constituted a ruling, evidence must be presented as to reason for alleged violation of election law or who was responsible for such violation; an improper ruling by election official re appointment of official counters does not entitle plaintiff to new election if cause of unreliability in election results is an alleged miscount, rather than ruling; as a general rule, a recount of vote is appropriate remedy when plaintiff has alleged simple counting mistake under Subsec.

If, after hearing, sufficient reason is shown, such judge may order any voting tabulators to be unlocked or any ballot boxes to be opened and a recount of the votes cast, including absentee ballots, to be made. Such judge shall thereupon, if he finds any error in the ruling of the election official, any mistake in the count of the votes or any violation of said sections, certify the result of his finding or decision to the Secretary of the State before the tenth day following the conclusion of the hearing. Such judge may (1) determine the result of such primary; (2) order a change in the existing primary schedule; or (3) order a new primary if he finds that but for the error in the ruling of the election official, any mistake in the count of the votes or any violation of said sections, the result of such primary might have been different and he is unable to determine the result of such primary.\n\n(c) The certification by the judge of his finding or decision shall be final and conclusive upon all questions relating to errors in the ruling of such election official, to the correctness of such count, and, for the purposes of this section only, such alleged violations, and shall operate to correct any returns or certificates filed by the election officials, unless the same is appealed from as provided in section 9-325 . In the event a new primary is held pursuant to such Superior Court order, the result of such new primary shall be final and conclusive unless a complaint is brought pursuant to this section. The clerk of the court shall forthwith transmit a copy of such findings and order to the Secretary of the State."

The court shall have authority to order that a municipality implement one or more remedies that may be inconsistent with the provisions of any municipal law or of any special act relating to the conduct of elections, where such inconsistent provisions would otherwise preclude the court from ordering an appropriate remedy.\n\n(f) (1) In the case of any proposal for a municipality to enact and implement (A) a new method of election to replace such municipality's at-large method of election with either a district-based method of election or an alternative method of election, or (B) a new districting or redistricting plan, the legislative body of such municipality shall act in accordance with the provisions of subdivision (2) of this subsection if any such proposal was made after the receipt of a notification letter described in subsection (g) of this section or after the filing of a claim pursuant to this section or the federal Voting Rights Act.\n\n(2) (A) Prior to drawing a draft districting or redistricting plan or plans, or transitioning to a proposed district-based method of election or alternative method of election, the municipality shall hold at least one public hearing at which members of the public may provide input regarding such draft or proposal, including, if applicable, the composition of districts. Notice of each such hearing shall be published at least three weeks prior to the date of such hearing. In advance of each such hearing, the municipality shall conduct outreach to members of the public, including to language minority groups, to explain the districting or redistricting process and to encourage such input.\n\n(B) After all such draft districting or redistricting plans are drawn, the municipality shall publish and make available for public dissemination at least one such plan and include the potential sequence of elections in the event the members of the legislative body of such municipality would be elected for staggered terms under such plan. The municipality shall hold at least one public hearing at which members of the public may provide input regarding the content of such plan or plans and, if applicable, such potential sequence of elections. Such plan or plans shall be published at least three weeks prior to consideration at each such hearing. If such plan or plans are revised at or following any such hearing, the municipality shall publish and make available for public dissemination such revised plan or plans at least two weeks prior to any adoption of such revised plan or plans.\n\n(g) (1) Prior to filing an action against a municipality pursuant to subsection (d) of this section, any party described in subsection (d) of this section shall send by certified mail, return receipt requested, a notification letter to the clerk of such municipality asserting that such municipality may be in violation of the provisions of sections 9-368j to 9-368q , inclusive.\n\n(2) (A) No such party may file an action pursuant to this section earlier than fifty days after sending such notification letter to such municipality.\n\n(B) Prior to receiving a notification letter, or not later than fifty days after any such notification letter is sent to a municipality, the legislative body of such municipality may pass a resolution (i) affirming such municipality's intention to enact and implement a remedy for a potential violation of the provisions of sections 9-368j to 9-368q , inclusive, (ii) setting forth specific measures such municipality will take to facilitate approval and implementation of such a remedy, and (iii) providing a schedule for the enactment and implementation of such a remedy. No party described in subsection (d) of this section may file an action pursuant to this section earlier than ninety days after passage of any such resolution by such legislative body.\n\n(C) If, under the laws of the state or under any charter or home rule ordinance, the legislative body of a municipality lacks authority to enact or implement a remedy identified in any such resolution within ninety days after the passage of such resolution, or if such municipality is a covered jurisdiction as described in section 9-368m , such legislative body shall take the following measures upon such passage:\n\n(i) The municipality shall hold at least one public hearing on any proposal to remedy any potential violation of the provisions of sections 9-368j to 9-368q , inclusive, at which members of the public may provide input regarding any such proposed remedies. In advance of each such hearing, the municipality shall conduct outreach to members of the public, including to language minority groups, to encourage such input.\n\n(ii) The legislative body of such municipality may approve any such proposed remedy that complies with the provisions of sections 9-368j to 9-368q , inclusive, and submit such proposed remedy to the Secretary of the State.\n\n(iii) Notwithstanding any provision of this title and any special act, charter or home rule ordinance, the Secretary of the State shall, not later than ninety days after submission of such proposed remedy by such municipality, approve or reject such proposed remedy in accordance with the provisions of this clause. The Secretary may require that such municipality or any other party provide additional information related to the submission of such proposed remedy. The Secretary may only approve such proposed remedy if the Secretary concludes (I) such municipality may be in violation of the provisions of sections 9-368j to 9-368q , inclusive, (II) the proposed remedy would address any such potential violation, (III) the proposed remedy does not violate the Constitution of Connecticut or any federal law, and (IV) the proposed remedy can be implemented in a manner that will not unduly disrupt the administration of an ongoing or imminent election.\n\n(iv) Notwithstanding any provision of this title and any special act, charter or home rule ordinance, if the Secretary of the State approves the proposed remedy, such proposed remedy shall be enacted and implemented immediately or, if immediate implementation would unduly disrupt the administration of an ongoing or imminent election, as soon as possible. If the municipality is a covered jurisdiction as described in section 9-368m , such municipality shall not be required to obtain preclearance for such proposed remedy.\n\n(v) If the Secretary of the State denies the proposed remedy, (I) such proposed remedy shall not be enacted or implemented, (II) the Secretary shall set forth the reasons for such denial, and (III) the Secretary may recommend another remedy that the Secretary would approve.\n\n(vi) If the Secretary of the State does not approve or reject such proposed remedy within ninety days after the submission of such proposed remedy by the municipality, the proposed remedy shall not be enacted or implemented.\n\n(D) A municipality that has passed a resolution described in subparagraph (B) of this subdivision may enter into an agreement with any party who sent a notification letter described in subdivision (1) of this subsection providing that such party shall not file an action pursuant to this section earlier than ninety days after entering into such agreement. If such party agrees to so enter into such an agreement, such agreement shall require that the municipality either enact and implement a remedy that complies with the provisions of sections 9-368j to 9-368q , inclusive, or pass such a resolution and submit such resolution to the Secretary of the State. If such party declines to so enter into such an agreement, such party may file an action pursuant to this section at any time, subject to the provisions of subparagraph (A) of this subdivision.\n\n(E) If, pursuant to the provisions of this subsection, a municipality enacts or implements a remedy or the Secretary of the State approves a proposed remedy, a party who sent a notification letter described in subdivision (1) of this subsection regarding a potential violation that is related to such remedy may, not later than thirty days after such enactment, implementation or approval, submit a claim for reimbursement from such municipality for the costs associated with producing and sending such notification letter. Such party shall submit such claim in writing and substantiate such claim with financial documentation, including a detailed invoice for any demography services or analysis of voting patterns in such municipality. Upon receipt of any such claim, such municipality may request additional financial documentation if that which has been provided by such party is insufficient to substantiate such costs. Such municipality shall reimburse such party for reasonable costs claimed or for an amount to which such party and such municipality agree, except that the cumulative amount of any such reimbursements to all such parties other than the Secretary of the State shall not exceed fifty thousand dollars, adjusted in accordance with any change in the consumer price index for all urban consumers as published by the United States Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics. If any such party and such municipality fail to agree to a reimbursement amount, either such party or such municipality may file an action for a declaratory judgment with the superior court for the judicial district in which such municipality is located for a clarification of rights.\n\n(F) (i) Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection, a party described in subsection (d) of this section may seek preliminary relief for a regular election held in a municipality by filing an action pursuant to this section during the one hundred twenty days prior to such regular election. Not later than the filing of such action, such party shall send a notification letter described in subdivision (1) of this subsection to such municipality. In the event any such action is withdrawn or dismissed as being moot as a result of such municipality's enactment or implementation of a remedy, or the approval by the Secretary of the State of a proposed remedy, any such party may only submit a claim for reimbursement in accordance with the provisions of subparagraph (E) of this subdivision.\n\n(ii) In the case of preliminary relief sought pursuant to subparagraph (F)(i) of this subdivision by a party described in subsection (d) of this section, the superior court for the judicial district in which such municipality is located shall grant such relief if such court determines that (I) such party has shown a substantial likelihood of success on the merits, and (II) it is possible to implement an appropriate remedy that would resolve the violation alleged under this section prior to such election in a manner that will not unduly disrupt such election."

For the purposes of this section, in a municipality that has a town meeting as its legislative body, the board of selectmen shall be deemed to be the legislative body of such municipality.\n\n(B) Each such explanatory text shall be prepared by the municipal clerk and shall specify the intent and purpose of each such proposal or question. Such explanatory text shall not advocate either the approval or disapproval of the proposal or question. The municipal clerk shall cause such question or proposal and such explanatory text to be printed in sufficient supply for public dissemination and shall also provide for the printing of such explanations of proposals or questions on posters of a size to be determined by said clerk. At least three such posters shall be posted at each polling place at which electors will be voting on such proposals or questions. Any posters printed in excess of the number required by this section to be posted may be displayed by said clerk at the clerk's discretion at locations which are frequented by the public. The explanatory text shall also be furnished to each absentee ballot applicant pursuant to subsection (d) of section 9-140 . Each such explanatory text shall be subject to the approval of the municipal attorney.\n\n(C) Any such other printed material shall be prepared by the person or persons so authorized by the legislative body, shall not advocate either the approval or disapproval of the proposal or question and shall be subject to the approval of the municipal attorney.\n\n(2) (A) For any referendum called for by a regional school district, the regional school board of education shall authorize the preparation, printing and dissemination of concise explanatory texts or other printed material with respect to proposals or questions approved for submission to the electors of the municipalities included in such regional school district at a referendum. For any such referendum, only the regional school board of education shall make any such authorization.\n\n(B) Each such explanatory text shall be prepared by the regional school board of education and shall specify the intent of each such proposal or question. Such explanatory text shall not advocate either the approval or disapproval of the proposal or question. The regional school board of education's secretary shall undertake any other duty of a municipal clerk, as described in subdivision (1) of this subsection. Each such explanatory text shall be subject to the approval of the regional school board of education's attorney.\n\n(C) Any such other printed material shall be prepared by the person or persons so authorized by the regional school board of education, shall not advocate either the approval or disapproval of the proposal or question and shall be subject to the approval of the regional school board of education's attorney.\n\n(3) (A) For purposes of this subdivision, “community notification system” means a communication system maintained by a municipality that is available to all residents of such municipality and permits any resident to opt to receive notifications of community events or news from such municipality via electronic mail, text, telephone or other electronic or automated means.\n\n(B) At the direction of the chief elected official of a municipality or, with respect to a referendum called for by a regional school district, the request of the chairperson of the regional school board of education having jurisdiction over such municipality included in such regional school district, a municipality that maintains a community notification system may use such system to send or publish a notice informing all residents enrolled in such system of an upcoming referendum. Such notice shall be limited to (i) the time and location of such referendum, (ii) a statement of the question as it is to appear on the ballot at the referendum, and (iii) if applicable, the explanatory text or other material approved in accordance with subdivision (1) or (2) of this subsection. Any such notice shall not advocate the approval or disapproval of the proposal or question or attempt to influence or aid the success or defeat of the referendum.\n\n(C) Other than a notice authorized by this subdivision, no person may use or authorize the use of municipal funds to send an unsolicited communication to a group of residents regarding a referendum via electronic mail, text, telephone or other electronic or automated means for the purpose of reminding or encouraging such residents to vote in a referendum, provided such prohibition shall not apply to a regularly published newsletter or similar publication.\n\n(D) An Internet web site maintained by a municipality or a regional school district shall not be deemed a community notification system for the purposes of this subdivision, but may contain a notice with the information described in subparagraph (B) of this subdivision.\n\n(4) Except as specifically authorized in this section, no expenditure of state or municipal funds shall be made to influence any person to vote for approval or disapproval of any such proposal or question or to otherwise influence or aid the success or defeat of any such referendum. The provisions of this subdivision shall not apply to a written, printed or typed summary of any official's views on a proposal or question, which is prepared for any news medium or which is not distributed with public funds to a member of the public except upon request of such member. For purposes of this section, the maintenance of a third-party comment posted on social media or on an Internet web site maintained by the state, a municipality or a regional school district permitting such third-party comments shall not constitute an expenditure of state or municipal funds.\n\n(b) The State Elections Enforcement Commission, after providing an opportunity for a hearing in accordance with chapter 54, may impose a civil penalty on any person who violates this section by authorizing an expenditure of state or municipal funds for a purpose which is prohibited by this section. The amount of any such civil penalty shall not exceed twice the amount of the improper expenditure or one thousand dollars, whichever is greater. In the case of failure to pay any such penalty imposed under this subsection within thirty days of written notice sent by certified or registered mail to such person, the superior court for the judicial district of Hartford, on application of the commission, may issue an order requiring such person to pay the penalty imposed. Notwithstanding the provisions of sections 5-141d , 7-101a and 7-465 , any other provision of the general statutes, and any provision of any special act or charter, no state or municipal officer or employee shall be indemnified or reimbursed by the state or a municipality for a civil penalty imposed under this subsection.\n\n(c) Any municipality may provide, by ordinance, for the preparation, printing and dissemination of concise summaries of arguments in favor of, and arguments opposed to, local proposals or questions approved for submission to the electors of a municipality at a referendum for which explanatory texts are prepared under subsection (a) of this section. Any such ordinance shall provide for the establishment or designation of a committee to prepare such summaries, in accordance with procedures set forth in said ordinance. The members of said committee shall be representatives of various viewpoints concerning such local proposals or questions. The committee shall provide an opportunity for public comment on such summaries to the extent practicable. Such summaries shall be approved by vote of the legislative body of the municipality, or any other municipal body designated by the ordinance, and shall be posted and distributed in the same manner as explanatory texts under subsection (a) of this section. Each summary shall contain language clearly stating that the printing of the summary does not constitute an endorsement by or represent the official position of the municipality."

Such certificate shall specify the candidate's name as the candidate authorizes it to appear on the ballot, the candidate's full residence address and the title of the office for which the candidacy is being filed. If such certificate for a state office is not received by the Secretary of the State by such time, such certificate shall be invalid and, for purposes of sections 9-416 and 9-416a , shall be deemed to have made no valid certification of nomination by a political party for such state office. A single such certificate or petition for state office may be filed on behalf of two or more candidates for different state offices who consent to have their names appear on a single row of the primary ballot under subsection (b) of section 9-437 .

Only as many candidates may be proposed in any one primary petition for the same office or position as are to be nominated or chosen by such party for such office or position; but any one primary petition may propose as many candidates for different offices or positions as there are nominations to be made or positions to be filled.\n\n(b) The names of enrolled party members signing a primary petition need not all be on one sheet but may be on several sheets, but no person shall sign more than one petition page for the same candidate or candidates. Any person who signs a name other than the person's own to a primary petition filed under the provisions of this section or who signs a name other than the person's own as circulator of such a petition shall be fined not more than one hundred dollars or imprisoned not more than one year or both. Each such sheet shall indicate the candidate or candidates supported, the offices or positions sought and the political party the nomination of which is sought or which is holding the primary for election of town committee members. No page of such a petition shall contain the names of enrolled party members residing in different municipalities and any page thereof which has been certified by the registrars of two or more municipalities shall be rejected by the registrar. Withdrawal of petition signatures shall not be permitted.\n\n(c) Each circulator of a primary petition page shall be an enrolled party member of a municipality in this state who is entitled to vote. Each petition page shall contain a statement signed by the registrar of the municipality in which such circulator is an enrolled party member attesting that the circulator is an enrolled party member in such municipality. Unless such a statement by the registrar appears on each page so submitted, the registrar shall reject such page. No candidate for the nomination of a party for a municipal office or the position of town committee member shall circulate any petition for another candidate or another group of candidates contained in one primary petition for the nomination of such party for the same office or position, and any petition page circulated in violation of this provision shall be rejected by the registrar. No person shall circulate petitions for more than the maximum number of candidates to be nominated by a party for the same office or position, and any petition page circulated in violation of this provision shall be rejected by the registrar. Each separate sheet of such petition shall contain a statement as to the authenticity of the signatures thereon and the number of such signatures, and shall be signed under the penalties of false statement by the person who circulated the same, setting forth such circulator's address and the town in which such circulator is an enrolled party member and attesting that each person whose name appears on such sheet signed the same in person in the presence of such circulator, that the circulator either knows each such signer or that the signer satisfactorily identified the signer to the circulator and that the spaces for candidates supported, offices or positions sought and the political party involved were filled in prior to the obtaining of the signatures. Each separate sheet of such petition shall also be acknowledged before an appropriate person as provided in section 1-29 . Any sheet of a petition filed with the registrar which does not contain such a statement by the circulator as to the authenticity of the signatures thereon, or upon which the statement of the circulator is incomplete in any respect, or which does not contain the certification hereinbefore required by the registrar of the town in which the circulator is an enrolled party member, shall be rejected by the registrar. Any individual proposed as a candidate in any primary petition may serve as a circulator of the pages of such petition, provided such individual's service as circulator does not violate any provision of this section."

The registrar may also appoint a deputy head moderator to assist the head moderator in the performance of the head moderator's duties. A deputy head moderator shall also be deemed to be a primary official. Each registrar's appointments of primary polling place officials, except moderators of polling places, and of designees to conduct supervised voting of absentee ballots pursuant to sections 9-159q and 9-159r shall be divided equally, as nearly as may be, between designees of the party-endorsed candidates and designees of one or more of the contestants, provided, if a party-endorsed candidate is a member of a party other than the one holding the primary, such primary officials shall be enrolled party members of the party holding the primary. Names of designees and alternate designees for such positions shall be submitted in writing by party-endorsed candidates and contestants to the registrar not later than twenty-one days before the primary and, if such lists are not so presented, all such appointments shall be made by the registrar but in the above-mentioned proportion. The registrar shall notify all such candidates and contestants of their right to submit a list of designees under this section. The registrars shall train each prospective primary poll worker to perform in the poll worker's designated position. Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, the registrar shall appoint as moderators only persons who are certified to serve as moderators or alternate moderators pursuant to section 9-229 , unless there is an insufficient number of such persons who are enrolled members of the registrar's party holding the primary, in which case the registrar may appoint a new moderator in accordance with section 9-229 , but only to the extent of such insufficiency.

              "(e) If paper ballots are required for the vote on any office or position in a municipality, the clerk of the municipality, in consultation with the registrars of voters, shall print a paper ballot for use in such primary for nomination to such office or election to such position. The Secretary of the State shall prescribe the form of such paper ballot. The Secretary of the State may prescribe general rules for the use of paper ballots in any primary, including the duties of officials at the polls with regard to the same, the marking of the same and the counting of the same. The procedure to be followed when paper ballots are so used shall conform, as nearly as may be, to the procedure applicable to voting tabulators provided in this chapter and to the law governing the use of paper ballots in regular elections and such rules shall have the force and effect of law. Chapter 54 shall not apply to rules made pursuant to this section.",
              "(f) The provisions of section 9-258 concerning additional lines of electors at a polling place, and of section 9-258a concerning two shifts of officials at a polling place, shall apply to a primary. Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, the provisions of the general statutes relating to the use of voting tabulators at regular elections shall apply as nearly as may be to the use of voting tabulators at primaries."

The vertical columns shall be headed by the designation of the office or position and instructions as to the number for which an elector may vote for such office or position, in the same manner as a ballot used in a regular election. The name of each candidate for town committee or municipal office, except for the municipal offices of state senator and state representative, shall appear on the ballot as authorized by each candidate. The name of each candidate for state or district office or for the municipal offices of state senator or state representative shall appear on the ballot as it appears on the certificate or statement of consent filed under section 9-388 , 9-391 , 9-400 or 9-409 . On the first horizontal line, below the designation of the office or position in each column, shall be placed the name of the party-endorsed candidate for such office or position, such name to be marked with an asterisk; provided, where more than one person may be voted for for any office or position, the names of the party-endorsed candidates shall be arranged in alphabetical order from left to right under the appropriate office or position designation and shall continue, if necessary, from left to right on the next lower line or lines. In the case of no party endorsement there shall be inserted the designation “no party endorsement” at the head of the vertical column, immediately beneath the designation of the office or position. On the horizontal lines below the line for party-endorsed candidates shall be placed, in the appropriate columns, the names of all other candidates as provided in this section.\n\n(b) (1) In the case of two or more such candidates for the same state or district office, precedence as to row shall be determined by the alphabetical order of the surnames of such candidates, except as provided under subdivision (2) of this subsection. (2) If a single certificate or a single petition has been filed under subsection (a) of section 9-400 on behalf of two or more candidates and proposing one candidate for each state office to be contested at such primary, a single row shall be used for the names of such candidates and precedence as to row between such certificates and petitions shall be determined by the Secretary of the State by lot in a ceremony which shall be open to the public. The names of all other candidates for state office shall be placed in the appropriate columns in alphabetical order on the rows below the row or rows used for candidates whose names are contained in such a single certificate, certificates, single petition or petitions.\n\n(c) Whenever the position of candidates or slates on the ballot under the provisions of this section is affected by the time or order of filing of primary petitions, and the registrar of voters certifies in writing to the town clerk that (1) two or more of the petitions to which such provisions apply were filed simultaneously, or (2) the registrar is unable to determine the time or order of filing of two or more such petitions, then for purposes of this section the order of filing of the petitions specified in the registrar's certification shall be determined by the town clerk by lot in a ceremony which shall be open to the public.\n\n(d) In the case of candidates for municipal office, a single row shall be used for the candidates whose names are contained in one primary petition, provided such petition proposes at least two candidates and the full number of candidates for each office to be contested at such primary as the party may nominate or choose thereat, precedence as to row being given to the candidates whose names appear in the first such petition filed, and so on in descending order.\n\n(e) The names of candidates for town committee members which are contained in one primary petition shall be placed in a separate row, precedence as to row being given to the candidates whose names appear in petitions in the order determined in accordance with this subsection. Petitions filed by nine o'clock a.m. on the first business day following the day on which petitions become available shall be given precedence as to row based on the number of valid signatures filed, in descending order from the greatest to the least. Petitions filed after nine o'clock a.m. on the first business day following the day on which petitions become available shall be given precedence as to row based on the order in which they are filed, if such petitions are filed during the regular business hours of the office of the registrars of voters or during any different hours for said office required under the general statutes. Such order of precedence shall be determined separately for petitions proposing the full number of candidates which the party may choose at the primary and for petitions proposing fewer than such full number of candidates, and provided further that petitions proposing such full number of candidates shall have precedence as to row over petitions proposing fewer than such full number of candidates.\n\n(f) Within such row or rows for those whose names are contained in one primary petition, where more than one person may be voted for any municipal office or position, such names shall be arranged in alphabetical order from left to right under the appropriate municipal office or position designation. The names of all other candidates shall be placed in the appropriate columns in alphabetical order on the horizontal lines below the line or lines used for candidates whose names are contained in one primary petition, if any; provided where more than one person may be voted for for any office or position, such names shall be arranged in alphabetical order from left to right under the appropriate office or position designation and shall continue, if necessary, from left to right on the next lower line or lines.\n\n(g) The name of each candidate shall appear on the ballot in such position as is required in this section, and such position shall be determined as of the final time for filing candidacies specified in section 9-400 or 9-405 . Vacancies in candidacies thereafter occurring shall not cause the position of any candidate's name on the ballot to be changed to another position. The name of any candidate whose candidacy has been vacated shall not appear on the ballot. If such a vacancy results in the cancellation of a primary for any office, the office column or columns where the names of the candidates and the title of the office would have appeared if the primary for that office had not been cancelled shall be left blank. If a vacancy occurs in a party-endorsed candidacy and a person is chosen in accordance with section 9-426 or 9-428 to fill the resulting vacancy in candidacy, the name of the person so chosen shall appear in the same position as that in which the name of the vacating candidate appeared. The municipal clerk shall have the ballot prepared so that the name of any candidate who has vacated such candidate's candidacy is deleted and so that the name of any candidate chosen to fill a vacancy in candidacy appears in the same position as that in which the vacated candidacy appeared. The municipal clerk may use printed stickers in preparing the ballots if the ballots were printed before the selection of a candidate to fill a vacancy in candidacy. If a vacancy in candidacy is not filled, the municipal clerk shall cause the name of the candidate whose candidacy has been vacated to be obscured in such manner that such name is no longer visible. The order of the offices and positions shall be as prescribed by the Secretary of the State.\n\n(h) The names of candidates for election as justices of the peace shall not appear on the ballot.

Ballots for the primary on such adjourned day shall be provided forthwith by the registrars of voters of each municipality wherein such primary stands adjourned, and each clerk of the municipality shall furnish the Secretary of the State with an accurate list of all candidates to be voted for at such adjourned primary.

No such primary shall be held if prior to such primary all but one of the candidates for such office die, withdraw their names or for any reason become disqualified to hold such office, and, in such event, the remaining candidate shall be deemed to be lawfully voted upon as the candidate for such office. No withdrawal shall be valid until the candidate who has withdrawn has filed a letter of withdrawal signed by such candidate with the Secretary of the State. When such a primary is required to be held under the provisions of this section and prior to such primary all but one of the candidates for such office die, withdraw their names or for any reason become disqualified to hold such office, the Secretary of the State shall forthwith notify the registrars of voters of such fact, and shall forthwith direct the registrars that such primary shall not be held.

The Secretary shall not issue any nominating petition forms unless the person requesting the nominating petition forms makes a written application for such forms, which application shall contain the following: (1) The name or names of the candidates to appear on such nominating petition, compared by the town clerk of the town of residence of each candidate with the candidate's name as it appears on the last-completed registry list of such town, and verified and corrected by such town clerk or in the case of a newly admitted elector whose name does not appear on the last-completed registry list, the town clerk shall compare the candidate's name as it appears on the candidate's application for admission and verify and correct it accordingly; (2) a signed statement by each such candidate that the candidate consents to the placing of the candidate's name on such petition; and (3) the party designation, if any. An applicant for petition forms who does not wish to specify a party designation shall so indicate on the application for such forms and the application, if so marked, shall not be amended in this respect. No application made after November 3, 1981, shall contain any party designation unless a reservation of such party designation with the Secretary is in effect for all of the offices included in the application or unless the party designation is the same as the name of a minor party which is qualified for a different office or offices on the same ballot as the office or offices included in the application. The Secretary shall not issue such forms (A) unless the application for forms on behalf of a candidate for the office of presidential elector is accompanied by the names of the candidates for President and Vice-President whom the candidate for the office of presidential elector represents and includes the consent of such candidates for President and Vice-President; (B) unless the application for forms on behalf of Governor or Lieutenant Governor is accompanied by the name of the candidate for the other office and includes the consent of both such candidates; (C) if petition forms have previously been issued on behalf of the same candidate for the same office unless the candidate files a written statement of withdrawal of the candidate's previous candidacy with the Secretary; and (D) unless the application meets the requirements of this section. A candidacy for nomination by nominating petition to a district or municipal office may be filed on behalf of any person whose name appears on the last-completed registry list of the district or municipality represented by such office, as the case may be. A candidacy for nomination by nominating petition to a state office may be filed on behalf of any person whose name appears on the last-completed registry list of the state."

The primary officials of each party for each polling place shall be as specified in section 9-436 , except that (1) the appointment of assistant registrars of voters and absentee ballot counters shall be permitted but not required, (2) the minimum number of official checkers shall be one, (3) the minimum number of voting tabulator tenders shall be one for each two voting tabulators in use, (4) if two parties are holding primaries and the registrars of voters of such parties so agree, such registrars of voters may jointly appoint (A) one moderator of both primaries and (B) one enrolled member of either party to serve as head moderator of both primaries, (5) notwithstanding any reduction in the number of primary officials as permitted by this section, any duty required of primary officials by the general statutes may be performed by one or more primary officials, at the direction of the registrar of voters of the party of such officials, and (6) the registrar of voters shall have the sole power to appoint such officials. In making such appointments the registrar shall attempt, to the extent practicable, to provide representation for each candidate at each polling place. The provisions of section 9-436a shall apply to each candidate whose name appears on the ballot, except that each such candidate, through such candidate's authorized or known representative, may submit to the registrar of voters the name of one designee as candidate checker for each polling place, and the registrar of voters shall appoint such designee as candidate checker for such candidate. Notwithstanding the provisions of section 9-438 , the polls shall be open for voting at the primary between the hours of six o'clock a.m. and eight o'clock p.m. The moderator or head moderator of the primary in each town shall prepare duplicate head moderator returns in the manner provided by section 9-440 , but notwithstanding the provisions of said section, the moderator or head moderator may electronically transmit such returns not later than eleven fifty-nine o'clock p.m. on primary day, provided a hard copy is mailed to the Secretary of the State not later than two o'clock p.m. of the day following the primary or shall hand deliver one of such returns to either the Secretary or the state police by two o'clock p.m. of the day following the primary. Any moderator or head moderator, as the case may be, who fails to deliver such returns to either the Secretary or the state police by such time shall pay a late filing fee of fifty dollars."
