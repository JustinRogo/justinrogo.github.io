The commissioner shall post information regarding the CTpass program and application process for such program on the Department of Transportation's Internet web site in a manner that, in the commissioner's discretion, will maximize awareness and participation by the greatest number of eligible organizations.\n\n(c) Upon receipt of an application from an eligible organization to participate in the CTpass program, the commissioner may negotiate the terms and conditions and enter into a contract with such eligible organization. The commissioner may treat several eligible organizations as a single eligible organization for the purposes of a contract under the CTpass program. Such terms and conditions shall include, but need not be limited to, (1) the amount of compensation or reimbursement required from the eligible organization, (2) the definition of approved class specific to the eligible organization, and (3) any limitations on times of use or types of public transit services available to the approved class. The compensation or reimbursement negotiated in the contract shall be in an amount as the commissioner deems necessary or advisable, provided the amount is sufficient to ensure that transit service expenditures incurred by the department do not increase as a result of the CTpass program and to cover any administrative costs incurred by the department in the operation of the CTpass program. A contract under the CTpass program shall be valid upon the approval of the Office of Policy and Management for a term of not more than two years, except the first contract with an eligible organization shall not exceed twelve months. Prior to any renewal of a contract with an eligible organization under the CTpass program, the commissioner shall consider prior pass utilization information and any transit service expenditure increases incurred by the department for the purpose of reevaluating the amount of compensation or reimbursement required from such eligible organization.\n\n(d) Not later than January 1, 2023, and annually thereafter, the Commissioner of Transportation shall submit a report to the Secretary of the Office of Policy and Management on the financial data and pass utilization information for each contract under the CTpass program."

Proceeds from investments authorized by this subparagraph, less amounts required under the proceedings authorizing the issuance of bonds for the payment of transportation costs relating to such bonds, shall be credited to the Special Transportation Fund created under section 13b-68 .\n\n(l) Any bonds issued under the provisions of sections 13b-74 to 13b-77 , inclusive, and any general obligation bonds of the state issued for transportation purposes, as defined in subsection (c) of section 13b-69 , and at any time outstanding may, at any time and from time to time, be refunded by the state by the issuance of its refunding bonds in such amounts as the State Bond Commission may deem necessary, but not to exceed an amount sufficient to refund the principal of the bonds to be so refunded, to pay any unpaid interest on such bonds and any premiums and commissions necessary to be paid in connection with such bonds and to pay costs and expenses which the Treasurer may deem necessary or advantageous in connection with the authorization, sale and issuance of refunding bonds. Any such refunding may be effected whether the bonds to be refunded shall have matured or shall thereafter mature. All refunding bonds issued under this subsection shall be payable solely from the revenues or other receipts, funds or moneys out of which the bonds to be refunded thereby are payable and shall be subject to and may be secured in accordance with the provisions of this section.\n\n(m) Whenever the issuance of bonds has been authorized pursuant to sections 13b-74 to 13b-77 , inclusive, the Treasurer may, pending the issuance thereof, and, subject to any applicable terms or provisions of the proceedings authorizing such issuances, issue, in the name of the state, bond anticipation notes and any renewals thereof.

The principal of and interest on any bond anticipation notes issued pursuant to this subsection may be repaid from pledged revenues or other pledged receipts, funds or moneys, to the extent not paid from the proceeds of renewals thereof or of the bonds. Upon the sale of the bonds, the proceeds thereof, to the extent required, shall be applied forthwith to the payment of the principal of and interest on any bond anticipation notes or shall be deposited in trust for such purpose. The date or dates of such bond anticipation notes, the maturities, denominations, form, details and other particulars of such bond anticipation notes, including the method, terms and conditions for the issue and sale thereof, shall be determined by the Treasurer in the best interest of the state, and the Treasurer shall file with the secretary of the State Bond Commission on or before the date of delivery of such bond anticipation notes a certificate of determination setting forth the specific details and particulars of each issue of bond anticipation notes, including renewals thereof.\n\n(n) Whenever the state has a written commitment to receive a grant-in-aid or similar form of assistance with respect to a project or program for which the issuance of bonds has been authorized pursuant to sections 13b-74 to 13b-77 , inclusive, the Treasurer may issue notes in anticipation of the issuance of such a grant-in-aid or other assistance, provided (1) the total amount of such notes shall not exceed the amount of the grant commitment which has not been paid to the state and (2) all grant payments with respect to such project or program received by the state, to the extent required, shall be applied promptly toward repayment of such temporary notes as the same shall become due and payable, or shall be deposited in trust for such purpose. Notes evidencing such borrowings shall be designated “Grant Anticipation Notes” and shall be signed by the manual or facsimile signature of the Treasurer or his deputy. The principal of and interest on any grant anticipation notes issued pursuant to this subsection may be repaid from the proceeds of renewals thereof, from grants-in-aid or other assistance pledged for the payment thereof, or from the proceeds of a credit facility including but not limited to, a letter of credit or policy of bond insurance. The Treasurer is hereby authorized to enter into reimbursement agreements or similar agreements with respect to such credit facilities, and the state's obligation under any such credit facility shall be included among the debt service requirements for the applicable period. The date or dates of such grant anticipation notes, the maturities, denomination, form, details and other particulars of such grant anticipation notes, including the method, terms and conditions for the issue and sale thereof, shall be determined by the Treasurer in the best interests of the state, and the Treasurer shall file with the secretary of the State Bond Commission on or before the date of delivery of such bond anticipation notes a certificate of determination setting forth the specific details and particulars of each issue of grant anticipation notes, including renewals thereof. This subsection shall not apply if the grant-in-aid or other assistance is to be paid over a period of years to reimburse the state for a portion of principal due on bonds or bond anticipation notes.\n\n(o) The State Bond Commission may make representations and agreements which are necessary or appropriate to ensure the exemption from taxation of interest on bonds or bond anticipation notes issued pursuant to sections 13b-74 to 13b-77 , inclusive, eligibility of such bonds or bond anticipation notes for tax credits or payments from the federal government, or any other desired federal income tax treatment of such bonds or bond anticipation notes, in each case under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or any subsequent corresponding internal revenue code of the United States, including agreements to pay rebates to the federal government of investment earnings derived from the investment of the proceeds of bonds or bond anticipation notes, or may delegate to the Treasurer the authority to make such representations and agreements on behalf of the state. Any such agreement may include (1) a covenant to pay rebates to the federal government of investment earnings derived from the investment of the proceeds of bonds or bond anticipation notes, (2) a covenant that the state will not limit or alter its rebate obligations until its obligations to the holders or owners of such bonds or bond anticipation notes are finally met and discharged, and (3) provisions to (A) establish trust and other accounts which may be appropriate to carry out such representations and agreements, (B) retain fiscal agents as depositories for such funds and accounts and (C) provide that such fiscal agents may act as trustee of such funds and accounts. Any such agreement entered into prior to May 16, 1988, is hereby validated. The State Bond Commission may also authorize, by a vote of a majority of the members of said commission, bonds or bond anticipation notes issued pursuant to sections 13b-74 to 13b-77 , inclusive, in such form and manner that the interest on such bonds and bond anticipation notes may be includable under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, or any subsequent corresponding internal revenue code of the United States, as from time to time amended, in the gross income of the holders or owners of such bonds or bond anticipation notes upon the finding by said commission that the issuance of such taxable bonds or bond anticipation notes is in the public interest."

              "(13) Whenever the issuance of bonds has been authorized pursuant to this section, the Treasurer may, pending the issuance thereof, and, subject to any applicable terms or provisions of the proceedings authorizing such issuances, issue, in the name of the state, bond anticipation notes and any renewals thereof. Notes evidencing such borrowings shall be designated “bond anticipation notes” and shall be signed by the Treasurer or his or her deputy. The principal of and interest on any bond anticipation notes issued pursuant to this subdivision may be repaid from pledged revenues or other pledged receipts, funds or moneys, to the extent not paid from the proceeds of renewals thereof or of the bonds.

The issuance of bonds issued under this section shall not directly or indirectly or contingently obligate the state or any political subdivision thereof to levy or to pledge any form of taxation therefor, or to make any additional appropriation for their payment. Such bonds shall not constitute a charge, lien or encumbrance, legal or equitable, upon any property of the state or of any political subdivision thereof other than the pledged revenues or other receipts, funds or moneys pledged therefor as provided in this section, and the substance of such limitation shall be plainly stated on the face of each such bond and bond anticipation note. Bonds issued pursuant to this section shall not be subject to any statutory limitation on the indebtedness of the state, and, when issued, shall not be included in computing the aggregate indebtedness of the state in respect to and to the extent of any such limitation.\n\n(2) Bonds issued pursuant to this section may be executed and delivered at such time or times and shall be dated, bear interest at such rate or rates, including variable rates to be determined in such manner as set forth in the proceedings authorizing the issuance of the bonds, provide for payment of interest on such dates, whether before or at maturity, be issued at, above or below par, mature at such time or times not exceeding thirty years from their date, have such rank or priority, be payable in such medium of payment, be issued in such form, including, without limitation, registered or book-entry form, carry such registration and transfer privileges and be made subject to purchase or redemption before maturity at such price or prices and under such terms and conditions, including the condition that such bonds be subject to purchase or redemption on the demand of the owner thereof, all as may be provided by the State Bond Commission. The State Bond Commission shall determine the form of the bonds, the manner of execution of the bonds, the denomination or denominations of the bonds and the manner of payment of principal and interest. Prior to the preparation of definitive bonds, the State Bond Commission may, under similar restrictions, authorize the issuance of interim receipts or temporary bonds, exchangeable for definitive bonds when such bonds have been executed and are available for delivery. If any of the officers whose signatures appear on the bonds cease to be officers before the delivery of any such bonds, such signatures shall, nevertheless, be valid and sufficient for all purposes, the same as if such officers had remained in office until delivery. Nothing in this subdivision shall prevent any series of bonds issued under the provisions of this section from being issued in coupon form, in which case references to the bonds in this subdivision also shall refer to the coupons attached thereto where appropriate, and references to owners of bonds shall include holders of such bonds where appropriate.\n\n(3) Any bonds issued pursuant to this section may be sold at public sale on sealed proposals or by negotiation in such manner, at such price or prices, at such time or times and on such other terms and conditions of such bonds and the issuance and sale thereof as the State Bond Commission may determine to be in the best interests of the state, or the State Bond Commission may delegate to the Treasurer all or any part of the foregoing powers, in which event the Treasurer shall exercise such powers unless the State Bond Commission, by adoption of a resolution prior to the exercise of such powers by the Treasurer shall elect to reassume the same. Such powers shall be exercised from time to time in such manner as the Treasurer shall determine to be in the best interests of the state and he or she shall file a certificate of determination setting forth the details thereof with the secretary of the State Bond Commission on or before the date of delivery of such bonds, the details of which were determined by him or her in accordance with such delegation.\n\n(4) The debt service requirements with respect to any bonds issued pursuant to this section shall be secured by (A) a first call upon the pledged revenues as they are received by the state and credited to the Grant Anticipation Transportation Fund established pursuant to subsection (b) of this section, and (B) a lien upon any and all amounts held to the credit of said Grant Anticipation Transportation Fund from time to time. Any obligation of the state secured by said lien to pay the unrefunded principal of bond anticipation notes, including for this purpose any obligation of the state under a reimbursement agreement entered into in connection with a credit facility providing for payment of the unrefunded principal of bond anticipation notes, shall be subordinate to any obligation of the state secured by said lien to pay (i) the debt service requirements with respect to bonds, excluding bond anticipation notes, or (ii) any debt service requirements with respect to bond anticipation notes other than debt service requirements relating to unrefunded principal of bond anticipation notes or to obligations under a credit facility for the payment of such unrefunded principal. The debt service requirements with respect to bonds also may be secured by a pledge of reserves, sinking funds and any other funds and accounts, including proceeds from investment of any of the foregoing, established pursuant to this section or the proceedings authorizing the issuance of such bonds, and by moneys paid under a credit facility, including, but not limited to, a letter of credit or policy of bond insurance issued by a financial institution pursuant to an agreement authorized by such proceedings.\n\n(5) The proceedings under which bonds are authorized to be issued may, subject to the provisions of the general statutes, contain any or all of the following: (A) Provisions respecting custody of the proceeds from the sale of the bonds, including any requirements that such proceeds be held separate from or not be commingled with other funds of the state; (B) provisions for the investment and reinvestment of bond proceeds until used to pay transportation costs and for the disposition of any excess bond proceeds or investment earnings thereon; (C) provisions for the execution of reimbursement agreements or similar agreements in connection with credit facilities, including, but not limited to, letters of credit or policies of bond insurance, remarketing agreements and agreements for the purpose of moderating interest rate fluctuations, and of such other agreements entered into pursuant to section 3-20a ; (D) provisions for the collection, custody, investment, reinvestment and use of the pledged revenues or other receipts, funds or moneys pledged therefor, as provided in this section; (E) provisions regarding the establishment and maintenance of reserves, sinking funds and any other funds and accounts as shall be approved by the State Bond Commission, in such amounts as may be established by the State Bond Commission, and the regulation and disposition thereof, including requirements that any such funds and accounts be held separate from or not be commingled with other funds of the state; (F) covenants for the issuance of additional bonds or the establishment of pledged revenue coverage requirements for the bonds; (G) covenants for the establishment of maintenance requirements with respect to state transportation facilities and properties; (H) provisions for the issuance of additional bonds on a parity with bonds theretofore issued, including establishment of additional bonds and coverage requirements with respect thereto as provided in this subdivision; (I) provisions regarding the rights and remedies available in case of a default to the bondowners, noteowners or any trustee under any contract, loan agreement, document, instrument or trust indenture, including the right to appoint a trustee to represent their interests upon occurrence of an event of default, as defined in said proceedings, provided if any bonds shall be secured by a trust indenture, the respective owners of such bonds shall have no authority except as set forth in such trust indenture to appoint a separate trustee to represent them; and (J) provisions or covenants of like or different character from the foregoing which are consistent with this section, and which the State Bond Commission determines in such proceedings are necessary, convenient or desirable in order to better secure the bonds, or will tend to make the bonds more marketable, and which are in the best interests of the state. Any provision which may be included in proceedings authorizing the issuance of bonds hereunder may be included in an indenture of trust duly approved in accordance with subdivision (7) of this subsection which secures the bonds and any notes issued in anticipation thereof, and in such case the provisions of such indenture shall be deemed to be a part of such proceedings as though they were expressly included therein.\n\n(6) Any pledge made by the state shall be valid and binding from the time when the pledge is made, and any revenues or other receipts, funds or moneys so pledged and thereafter received by the state shall be subject immediately to the lien of such pledge without any physical delivery thereof or further act. The lien of any such pledge shall be valid and binding as against all parties having claims of any kind in tort, contract or otherwise against the state, irrespective of whether such parties have notice thereof. Neither the resolution nor any other instrument by which a pledge is created need be recorded.\n\n(7) In the discretion of the State Bond Commission, bonds issued pursuant to this section may be secured by a trust indenture by and between the state and a corporate trustee, which may be any trust company or bank having the powers of a trust company within or without the state. Such trust indenture may contain such provisions for protecting and enforcing the rights and remedies of the bondowners and noteowners as may be reasonable and proper and not in violation of law, including covenants setting forth the duties of the state in relation to the exercise of its powers pursuant to the provisions of this section and the custody, safeguarding and application of all moneys. The state may provide by such trust indenture for the payment of the pledged revenues or other receipts, funds or moneys to the trustee under such trust indenture or to any other depository, and for the method of disbursement thereof, with such safeguards and restrictions as it may determine. All expenses incurred in carrying out such trust indenture may be treated as state transportation costs, as defined in subsection (a) of this section.\n\n(8) The Treasurer shall have power to purchase bonds of the state issued pursuant to this section out of any funds available therefor. The Treasurer may hold, pledge, cancel or resell such bonds subject to and in accordance with agreements with bondowners or noteowners.\n\n(9) Whether or not the bonds issued pursuant to this section are of such form and character as to be negotiable instruments under the terms of the Uniform Commercial Code, such bonds are hereby made negotiable instruments within the meaning of and for all purposes of the Uniform Commercial Code, subject only to the provisions of such bonds for registration.\n\n(10) The proceeds of bonds issued pursuant to this section may be used to pay only state transportation costs. Costs incurred relating to any of the purposes for which bonds may be issued pursuant to the provisions of this section shall be deemed state transportation costs. Nothing in this subsection shall limit the issuance of refunding bonds pursuant to this section.\n\n(11) Any moneys held by the Treasurer or by a trustee pursuant to a trust indenture with respect to bonds issued pursuant to this section, including pledged revenues, other pledged receipts, funds or moneys and proceeds from the sale of such bonds, may, pending the use or application of the proceeds thereof for an authorized purpose, be (A) invested and reinvested in such obligations, securities and investments as are set forth in subsection (f) of section 3-20 , and in participation certificates in the Short Term Investment Fund created under section 3-27a , or (B) deposited or redeposited in such bank or banks as shall be provided in the resolution authorizing the issuance of such bonds, the certificate of determination authorizing issuance of bond anticipation notes, or in the indenture securing such bonds. Proceeds from investments authorized by this subparagraph, less amounts required under the proceedings authorizing the issuance of bonds for the payment of transportation costs relating to such bonds, shall be credited to the Grant Anticipation Transportation Fund created under subsection (b) of this section.\n\n(12) Any bonds issued under the provisions of this section, and at any time outstanding may, at any time and from time to time, be refunded by the state by the issuance of its refunding bonds in such amounts as the State Bond Commission may deem necessary, but not to exceed an amount sufficient to (A) refund the principal of the bonds to be so refunded, (B) pay any unpaid interest on such bonds and any premiums and commissions necessary to be paid in connection with such bonds, and (C) pay costs and expenses which the Treasurer may deem necessary or advantageous in connection with the authorization, sale and issuance of refunding bonds. Any such refunding may be effected whether the bonds to be refunded shall have matured or shall thereafter mature. All refunding bonds issued under this subdivision shall be payable solely from the revenues or other receipts, funds or moneys out of which the bonds to be refunded thereby are payable, and shall be subject to and may be secured in accordance with the provisions of this section.\n\n(13) Whenever the issuance of bonds has been authorized pursuant to this section, the Treasurer may, pending the issuance thereof, and, subject to any applicable terms or provisions of the proceedings authorizing such issuances, issue, in the name of the state, bond anticipation notes and any renewals thereof. Notes evidencing such borrowings shall be designated “bond anticipation notes” and shall be signed by the Treasurer or his or her deputy. The principal of and interest on any bond anticipation notes issued pursuant to this subdivision may be repaid from pledged revenues or other pledged receipts, funds or moneys, to the extent not paid from the proceeds of renewals thereof or of the bonds. Upon the sale of the bonds, the proceeds thereof, to the extent required, shall be applied forthwith to the payment of the principal of and interest on any bond anticipation notes or shall be deposited in trust for such purpose. The date or dates of such bond anticipation notes, the maturities, denominations, form, details and other particulars of such bond anticipation notes, including the method, terms and conditions for the issue and sale thereof, shall be determined by the Treasurer in the best interest of the state. The Treasurer shall file with the secretary of the State Bond Commission on or before the date of delivery of such bond anticipation notes a certificate of determination setting forth the specific details and particulars of each issue of bond anticipation notes, including renewals thereof.\n\n(14) The State Bond Commission may make representations and agreements for the benefit of the holders of bonds issued pursuant to this section which are necessary or appropriate to ensure the exemption of interest on such bonds from taxation under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, or any subsequent corresponding internal revenue code of the United States, as from time to time amended including agreements to pay rebates to the federal government of investment earnings derived from the investment of the proceeds of bonds, or may delegate to the Treasurer the authority to make such representations and agreements on behalf of the state. Any such agreement may include (A) a covenant to pay rebates to the federal government of investment earnings derived from the investment of the proceeds of bonds, (B) a covenant that the state will not limit or alter its rebate obligations until its obligations to the holders or owners of such bonds are finally met and discharged, and (C) provisions to (i) establish trust and other accounts which may be appropriate to carry out such representations and agreements, (ii) retain fiscal agents as depositories for such funds and accounts, and (iii) provide that such fiscal agents may act as trustee of such funds and accounts. The State Bond Commission may also authorize, by a vote of a majority of the members of said commission, bonds issued pursuant to the provisions of this section in such form and manner that the interest on such bonds may be includable under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, or any subsequent corresponding internal revenue code of the United States, as from time to time amended, in the gross income of the holders or owners of such bonds upon the finding by said commission that the issuance of such taxable bonds is in the public interest.\n\n(e) (1) The state covenants with the purchasers and all subsequent owners and transferees of bonds issued by the state pursuant to this section in consideration of the acceptance of and payment for the bonds, that the principal and interest of such bonds shall be free at all times from taxation, except for estate and gift taxes, imposed by the state or by any political subdivision thereof. The Treasurer is authorized to include this covenant of the state in any agreement with the owner of any such bonds.\n\n(2) Bonds issued pursuant to this section are hereby made securities in which all public officers and public bodies of the state and its political subdivisions, all insurance companies, credit unions, building and loan associations, investment companies, banking associations, trust companies, executors, administrators, trustees and other fiduciaries and pension, profit-sharing and retirement funds may properly and legally invest funds, including capital in their control or belonging to them. Such bonds are hereby made securities which may properly and legally be deposited with and received by any state or municipal officer or any agency or political subdivision of the state for any purpose for which the deposit of bonds or obligations of the state is now or may hereafter be authorized by law.\n\n(3) The state covenants with the purchasers and all subsequent owners and transferees of bonds issued by the state pursuant to this section, in consideration of the acceptance of the payment for the bonds, until such bonds, together with the interest thereon, with interest on any unpaid installment of interest and all costs and expenses in connection with any action or proceeding on behalf of such owners, are fully met and discharged, or unless expressly permitted or otherwise authorized by the terms of each contract and agreement made or entered into by or on behalf of the state with or for the benefit of such owners, that the state will collect and apply the pledged revenues and other receipts, funds or moneys pledged for the payment of debt service requirements as provided in this section, in such amounts as may be necessary to pay such debt service requirements in each year in which bonds are outstanding and further, that the state: (A) Will not limit or alter the duties imposed on the Treasurer and other officers of the state by the provisions of this section and by the proceedings authorizing the issuance of bonds with respect to application of pledged revenues or other receipts, funds or moneys pledged for the payment of debt service requirements as provided by the provisions of this section; (B) will not issue any bonds, notes or other evidences of indebtedness, other than the bonds, having any rights arising out of this section or secured by any pledge of or other lien or charge on the pledged revenues or other receipts, funds or moneys pledged for the payment of debt service requirements as provided in this section; (C) will not create or cause to be created any lien or charge on such pledged amounts, other than a lien or pledge created thereon pursuant to this section, provided nothing in this section shall prevent the state from issuing evidences of indebtedness (i) which are secured by a pledge or lien which is and shall on the face thereof be expressly subordinate and junior in all respects to every lien and pledge created by or pursuant to this section; (ii) for which the full faith and credit of the state is pledged and which are not expressly secured by any specific lien or charge on such pledged amounts; or (iii) which are secured by a pledge of or lien on moneys or funds derived on or after such date as every pledge or lien thereon created by or pursuant to this section shall be discharged and satisfied; (D) will carry out and perform, or cause to be carried out and performed, each and every promise, covenant, agreement or contract made or entered into by the state or on its behalf with the owners of any bonds; (E) will not in any way impair the rights, exemptions or remedies of such owners; and (F) will not limit, modify, rescind, repeal or otherwise alter the rights or obligations of the appropriate officers of the state to collect the receipts constituting the pledged revenues as may be necessary to produce sufficient revenues to fulfill the terms of the proceedings authorizing the issuance of the bonds. The State Bond Commission is authorized to include this covenant of the state in any agreement with the owner of any such bonds."

No such certificate shall be issued unless the department finds that the person, association, limited liability company or corporation is suitable to operate a taxicab service, after giving due consideration to, at a minimum, the following factors: (1) Any convictions of the applicant under federal, state or local laws relative to safety, motor vehicle or criminal violations; (2) the number of taxicabs to be operated under the certificate, provided no applicant for a new certificate shall operate fewer than three taxicabs; (3) the adequacy of the applicant's financial resources to operate the taxicab service; (4) the adequacy of insurance coverage and safety equipment; and (5) the availability of qualified taxicab operators. The commissioner shall request the state criminal history records check for any person or any officer of any association, limited liability company or corporation applying for such certificate from the State Police Bureau of Identification. The commissioner shall arrange for the fingerprinting of any person or any officer of any association, limited liability company or corporation applying for such certificate and forward the fingerprints to said bureau which shall submit the fingerprints to the Federal Bureau of Investigation for a national criminal history records check for any federal conviction specified in subdivision (1) of this subsection. The commissioner shall charge a fee for each such national criminal history records check which shall be equal to the fee charged by the Federal Bureau of Investigation for performing such check. Such certificate shall be issued only after written application, fingerprinting and said criminal history records check for the same has been made and public hearing held thereon. The application shall be accompanied by a fee of two thousand dollars and the fee for said criminal history records check. Upon receipt of such application, the department shall fix a time and place of hearing thereon and shall promptly give written notice of the pendency of such application and of the time and place of such hearing to the applicant, the mayor of each city, the warden of each borough or the first selectman of each town in which the applicant desires to originate the transportation of such passengers, and to any common carrier operating within the territory specified. Notwithstanding any provision of this subsection to the contrary, the department may, upon receipt of a written application, amend an existing certificate to increase the number of taxicabs which may be operated pursuant to the certificate without holding a hearing on the application, provided the department issues a legal notice of such application in a daily newspaper in accordance with the provisions of section 1-2 , gives written notice of the pendency of such application to any common carrier operating within the territory specified and no objection is filed with the department within thirty days of each such notice.\n\n(b) Any town, city or borough within which taxicab service is operated or any interested party may bring a written petition to the department with respect to fares, service, operation or equipment or the convenience, protection and safety of passengers and the public. Thereupon, the department may fix a time and place for a hearing upon such petition, and give written notice thereof to the parties in interest at least one week prior to such hearing.\n\n(c) No certificate shall be sold or transferred until the department, upon written application to it setting forth the purpose, terms and conditions thereof, and after investigation, finds that the purchaser or transferee is suitable to operate a taxicab service after consideration of the factors specified in subsection (a) of this section and approves the same. The application shall be accompanied by a fee of one thousand dollars. The department may amend or, for sufficient cause shown, may suspend or revoke any such certificate. The department may impose a civil penalty on any person or any officer of any association, limited liability company or corporation or any driver who violates any provision of this chapter or any regulation adopted under section 13b-96 with respect to fares, service, operation or equipment, in an amount not to exceed one hundred dollars per day for each violation. Any such certificate issued by the department shall remain valid unless suspended or revoked by the department. Any such certificate issued by the Division of Public Utility Control within the Department of Business Regulation prior to October 1, 1979, or by any transit district prior to March 1, 1997, shall remain valid unless suspended or revoked by the Department of Transportation.\n\n(d) Any person, association, limited liability company or corporation which has obtained a certificate under subsection (a) of this section, after providing proof that service has been active and in compliance with all relevant statutes and regulations, may solicit, receive and discharge taxicab passengers at Bradley International Airport, subject to formal agreement with the executive director of the Connecticut Airport Authority. Any such person, association, limited liability company or corporation may discharge taxicab passengers received at such airport within a territory other than the territory specified in its certificate. The executive director may charge and collect a reasonable fee from any such person, association, limited liability company or corporation for the privilege of solicitation of such passengers."

(2) Notwithstanding the provisions of subdivision (1) of this subsection, the department may issue a permit for the operation of vehicles (A) having a capacity of less than eleven adults or to be used exclusively at funerals, weddings, christenings, processions or celebrations, without holding a hearing and certifying that public convenience and necessity would be improved by the operation of such vehicles, or (B) having a capacity of not less than eleven or more than fourteen adults and used for sightseeing and related purposes, without holding a hearing, provided the department issues a legal notice, as provided under section 12, of such application and no objection is filed with the department within thirty days of publication of such notice. (3) Notwithstanding the provisions of subdivision (1) of this subsection, the department may issue a temporary or permanent permit to any person, association, limited liability company or corporation operating a motor vehicle engaged in the transportation of passengers for hire by virtue of a contract with, or a lower tier contract for, any federal, state or municipal agency that (A) is in effect on July 1, 1997, with or without hearing, after a written application for the same has been made and the department has determined that the applicant meets the requirements of subsection (b) of this section except with respect to public convenience and necessity, or (B) becomes effective after July 1, 1997, with or without hearing, after a written application for the same has been made and the department has determined that the applicant meets the requirements of subsection (b) of this section. Any such permit issued under the provisions of this subdivision (i) shall be limited to service provided under any such contract, and (ii) with respect to any contract under the provisions of subparagraph (A) of this subdivision, shall not authorize a total number of motor vehicles exceeding the number required to provide service existing under such contract on July 1, 1997. (4) Notwithstanding the provisions of subdivision (1) of this subsection, the department shall issue to any person who has an intrastate livery permit for at least one year, upon the application of such person, up to two additional vehicle authorizations each year without a hearing and without written notice of the pendency of the application, if all the existing permits held by such person are registered and in use and if there are no outstanding violations or matters pending adjudication against such person. Such person may submit a second application for up to two additional vehicle authorizations each year. The department shall have thirty calendar days to issue such amended permit upon receipt of an application and the payment of the fee described in subdivision (1) of this subsection.\n\n(b) In determining whether or not such a permit will be granted, the Department of Transportation shall take into consideration the present or future public convenience and necessity for the service the applicant proposes to render, the suitability of the applicant or the suitability of the management if the applicant is a limited liability company or corporation, the financial responsibility of the applicant, the ability of the applicant efficiently and properly to perform the service for which authority is requested and the fitness, willingness and ability of the applicant to conform to the provisions of this chapter and the requirements and regulations of the department under this chapter.\n\n(c) Any interested party may bring a written petition to the Department of Transportation in respect to fares, service, operation or equipment, or the convenience, protection and safety of the public with regard to any carrier operating a motor vehicle in livery service. Thereupon, the department may fix a time and place for a hearing upon such petition and give notice thereof. No permit shall be sold or transferred until the department, upon written application to it setting forth the purpose, terms and conditions thereof and accompanied by a fee of two hundred dollars, after investigation, approves the same. The department may amend or, for sufficient cause shown, may suspend or revoke any such permit. The department may order appropriate corrective action as the department deems necessary, including, but not limited to, the attendance of a motor vehicle operator retraining program. The department may impose a civil penalty on any person or any officer of any association, limited liability company or corporation who violates any provision of this chapter or any regulation adopted under section 13b102 with respect to fares, service, operation, equipment, management or staffing, in an amount not to exceed one thousand dollars per day for each violation. Prior to the imposition of a civil penalty under this subsection, the department shall provide notice to such person or officer no later than fifteen business days after receipt of information concerning an alleged violation and shall provide an opportunity for a hearing.\n\n(d) (1) Any person who holds himself or herself out to be the operator of a motor vehicle in livery service who has not received a permit under this section shall be guilty of a class B misdemeanor.\n\n(2) The state shall remit to a municipality fifty per cent of the fine amount received for a violation of subdivision (1) of this subsection with respect to each summons issued by such municipality. Each clerk of the Superior Court or the Chief Court Administrator, or any other official of the Superior Court designated by the Chief Court Administrator, shall, on or before the thirtieth day of January, April, July and October in each year, certify to the Comptroller the amount due for the previous quarter under this subsection to each municipality served by the office of the clerk or official.\n\n(e) The Department of Transportation may revoke a permit issued under this section or section 13b-105 without a hearing, provided (1) the department sends a notice of revocation to the permit holder at the address of the permit holder on file with the department and (A) the notice is returned as undeliverable or could not be delivered, or (B) the permit holder fails to respond to the notice within the time period specified by the department in such notice, (2) the department conducts a physical inspection of the address of the permit holder on file with the department and determines that no livery service is operated at such address, and (3) no motor vehicle is registered by the permit holder with the Department of Motor Vehicles to be used as specified in the permit pursuant to section 13b-106 ."

Nothing in this section shall be construed to: (1) Require an insurance company that issues automobile liability insurance policies in this state to issue automobile liability insurance policies that provide the coverage specified under subsection (a) of this section, or (2) preclude an insurance company from providing primary or excess coverage by contract or endorsement for a transportation network company vehicle.\n\n(c) If an automobile liability insurance policy maintained by a transportation network company driver has lapsed or does not provide the coverage required under subsection (a) of this section, the transportation network company's automobile liability insurance policy shall provide such coverage, beginning with the first dollar of a claim, and the insurance company issuing such policy shall have the duty to defend a claim that arises while the driver is connected to the transportation network company's digital network or is engaged in the provision of a prearranged ride.\n\n(d) Coverage under an automobile liability insurance policy maintained by a transportation network company shall not be contingent on another insurance company first denying a claim, nor shall such other insurance company be required to first deny a claim.\n\n(e) A transportation network company may procure the coverage required under subsection (a) of this section from: (1) An insurance company authorized to do business in this state, or (2) a surplus lines insurer that has at least an A minus credit rating by A.M. Best or an A or similar credit rating by another rating agency approved by the Insurance Commissioner. Any such insurance company or surplus lines insurer shall comply with the provisions of subsection (a) of section 38a-318a .\n\n(f) (1) A transportation network company driver shall carry proof of insurance satisfying the coverage required under subsection (a) of this section at all times during the driver's use of a transportation network company vehicle while connected to a transportation network company's digital network or engaged in the provision of a prearranged ride. The transportation network company shall ensure it provides such proof of insurance to all of its drivers to whom such transportation network company is providing such coverage.\n\n(2) In the event of an accident, a transportation network company driver shall provide such proof of insurance coverage to the directly interested parties, insurance companies and investigating police officers. A transportation network company driver shall disclose, upon request, to directly interested parties, insurance companies and investigating police officers whether the driver was connected to the transportation network company's digital network or was engaged in the provision of a prearranged ride at the time of the accident.\n\n(3) In any claims coverage investigation, a transportation network company shall immediately provide, upon a request from a directly involved party or the transportation network company driver's insurance company, the precise times the driver was connected to and disconnected from the transportation network company's digital network in the twelve-hour periods immediately preceding and immediately following the accident. An insurance company providing any coverage required under subsection (a) of this section shall disclose, upon request by any other insurance company providing any coverage required under said subsection, the applicable coverages, exclusions and limits under the automobile liability insurance policy issued to satisfy the coverage requirements under said subsection.\n\n(g) Notwithstanding the provisions of sections 14-112 , 38a-334 , 38a-335 and 38a-336 , an insurance company that offers automobile liability insurance coverage in this state may offer automobile liability insurance policies to individuals that exclude any or all coverage afforded under such policies for any loss or injury that occurs during the period an insured is connected to a transportation network company's digital network and available to receive requests for prearranged rides or engaged in the provision of a prearranged ride. Such exclusions may include, but are not limited to: (1) Liability coverage for bodily injury, death or property damage; (2) personal injury protection coverage; (3) uninsured and underinsured motorist coverage; (4) medical payments coverage; (5) collision physical damage coverage; or (6) comprehensive physical damage coverage. Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to require an insurance company that clearly and conspicuously discloses such exclusions to use any particular policy language or reference to this subsection to exclude any or all coverage pursuant to this subsection.\n\n(h) (1) An insurance company that excludes coverage pursuant to subsection (g) of this section shall have no duty to defend or indemnify any claim against a transportation network company driver for which coverage is expressly excluded in such driver's automobile liability insurance policy. If an insurance company defends or indemnifies a claim against a transportation network company driver for which coverage is expressly excluded in such driver's automobile liability insurance policy, the insurance company shall have a right of subrogation against other insurance companies that provide automobile liability insurance coverage to such driver to satisfy the requirements of subsection (a) of this section.\n\n(2) Nothing in this section shall be construed to invalidate or limit an exclusion contained in an automobile liability insurance policy, including any such policy in use or approved for use in this state prior to January 1, 2018, that excludes coverage for vehicles used to transport property or passengers for a fee or available for hire by the public.\n\n(i) Prior to initially permitting a transportation network company driver to accept a rider request for a prearranged ride through the transportation network company's digital network, a transportation network company shall disclose, in writing, to such driver the following:\n\n(1) The insurance coverage, including the types of coverage and the limits for each type of coverage, that the transportation network company provides during the period such driver is using a transportation network company vehicle while connected to the transportation network company's digital network and available to receive requests for prearranged rides or engaged in the provision of a prearranged ride;\n\n(2) A statement that such driver's automobile insurance policy might not provide coverage while such driver is connected to the transportation network company's digital network and available to receive requests for prearranged rides or engaged in the provision of a prearranged ride; and\n\n(3) A statement that if such driver's transportation network company vehicle has a lien on it, the use of such vehicle for such purposes without physical damage coverage may violate the terms of the contract with the lienholder."

If the highway affected by such last-mentioned order has been constructed since the railroad which it crosses at grade, said commissioner may order an amount not exceeding one-half of the whole expense of such alteration or removal, including the damages, to be paid by the town, city or borough in whose behalf the application is brought, and the remainder of the expense shall be paid by the company owning or operating the road which crosses such public highway.

(a), (b) and (c) from existing section, substituted “transportation fund” for “highway fund” and provided that any roadway construction in the approaches beyond that required to build the new structure to be paid for by town if work done by or approved by the town; P.A. 77-151 provided in Subsec. (a) for repair of structures by town, city or borough and for the purchasing of insurance (rider to existing policy) insuring against losses suffered during performance of such repairs in lieu of purchasing a separate policy; in 1981 Sec. 16-111 transferred to Sec. 13b-283; P.A. 85-540 took responsibility for the maintenance and repair of structures over tracks from railroad companies, required the state to maintain and repair any structure which spans a railroad and which supports a municipal road or which spans any rail right-of-way purchased by a state agency, required the commissioner of transportation to adopt regulations apportioning the cost of repair and maintenance among the state, municipality and owner of the structure, and allowed the commissioner to expend funds appropriated from state funds other than the transportation fund for the purposes of carrying out the provisions of Subsecs. (b) and (c); P.A. 88-364 made technical change in Subsec. (a); P.A. 94-188 amended Subsec.

The Commissioner of Transportation shall adopt regulations in accordance with the provisions of chapter 54, and may enter into an agreement with any municipality, as provided in subsection (f) of this section, establishing a method by which the cost of repairing and maintaining any structure provided for in subdivision (1) of this subsection shall be apportioned between the state and the municipality in which such structure is located. Any municipality may repair such structures over the tracks of a railroad company located within such municipality. For the purpose of obtaining liability insurance coverage insuring against any losses or injuries suffered during the performance of such repairs, such municipality may, in lieu of purchasing a separate policy of insurance naming such railroad company as an additional insured, purchase a rider to be attached to any existing insurance policy providing such liability coverage, naming such railroad company as an additional insured. The state shall maintain and repair the structures over any railroad on state-maintained highways constructed after January 1, 1955.\n\n(b) The Commissioner of Transportation may expend up to the amount available annually from funds provided by specific appropriation from the Special Transportation Fund or other state funds in addition to any available federal funds to reconstruct, repair or replace with a new structure, together with the minimum approach work required for replacement, any existing structure carrying a town-maintained road or highway over a railroad when such structure is deemed critical from a traffic safety or load-carrying standpoint. The expense of any roadway construction on the approaches beyond what is required to build the new structure shall be paid by the municipality, if the work is done by or approved by the municipality.\n\n(c) The Commissioner of Transportation may expend up to the amount made available from funds provided by specific appropriations from the Special Transportation Fund or other state funds in addition to any available federal funds to eliminate highway-railroad grade crossings by construction of grade separation structures and necessary approaches or by relocation of roads or highways maintained by a municipality to provide access to existing grade separation structures.\n\n(d) The Commissioner of Transportation, as said commissioner deems necessary, may acquire land or rights of ingress to and egress from land abutting any project which he or she undertakes pursuant to this section in the same manner and with like powers as authorized and exercised by said commissioner in acquiring land for state highway purposes.\n\n(e) The Commissioner of Transportation, as said commissioner deems necessary, may issue an order to any utility, as defined in section 13a-98f , to readjust, relocate or remove its facility, at its own expense, from any structure or road abutting a structure in order to perform maintenance or repairs pursuant to this section and such utility shall readjust, relocate or remove its facility promptly in accordance with such order, except that the cost of readjusting, relocating, or removing any municipal utility shall be apportioned on the same basis as the cost of constructing such structure or road abutting such structure.

If the commissioner upon such hearing finds that public safety requires it, the commissioner shall order such company to install and maintain, at such crossing, gates, a flagman or such electric signals or other signal device as may be approved by the commissioner, or to do any other act deemed necessary for the protection of the public. The commissioner may rescind, alter or amend any such order, whenever the commissioner deems it necessary, upon first giving the municipality wherein the crossing is located and the railroad company an opportunity to be heard thereon. If any such company fails to comply with any order of the commissioner made pursuant to this section, it shall forfeit to the state fifty dollars for each day of such failure. The commissioner shall notify state and municipal elected officials of affected towns of the reactivation of any railroad line not later than forty-five days from notification to the Department of Transportation, by the railroad, of such reactivation. The commissioner, or the commissioner's designee, shall determine if a public hearing on the safety of rail crossings is required on the reactivated railroad line, provided, if a state or municipal official requests a public hearing, the commissioner shall hold a public hearing. Any such hearing shall be scheduled not later than ninety days prior to the reactivation of such railroad line. Any comments or recommendations on railroad safety that are provided to the public hearing officer during the public hearing shall be reviewed and incorporated, as deemed appropriate by the commissioner, to address concerns raised at the hearing."
