Thereupon such selectmen or other authority shall authorize the town clerk, upon the payment by the applicant of a fee equal to the taxes assessable in such town, city or borough under the last-preceding tax levy therein upon an amount of property of the same valuation, to issue to him a license authorizing such closing-out sale in such municipality. Such authority may authorize the issue of such license without the filing of such statement, upon the payment of a license fee fixed by it. Upon payment of such fee, such town clerk shall issue such license, which shall remain in force as long as the licensee continuously keeps and exposes for sale in such municipality such stock of goods, wares or merchandise, but not later than the first day of October following its date. Upon such payment and proof of payment of all other license fees, if any, chargeable upon local sales, such town clerk shall record the state license of such transient vendor in full, shall endorse thereon the words “local license fees paid” and shall affix thereto his official signature and the date of such endorsement."

Such license shall be displayed in a conspicuous location in the place where such business is carried on. At the time of application for such license and each renewal thereof, the applicant shall disclose to the licensing authority all places used or intended to be used by the business for the purchase, receipt, storage or sale of property. During the term of such license, the licensee shall notify the licensing authority of any additional places that will be used by the business for the purchase, receipt, storage or sale of property prior to such use.\n\n(d) An application for such license shall be made in writing, under oath. The application shall contain: (1) The type of business to be engaged in, (2) the applicant's full name, age and date and place of birth, (3) the applicant's residence addresses and places of employment within the preceding five years, (4) the applicant's present occupation, (5) any crime of which the applicant has been convicted and the date and place of such conviction, and (6) such additional information as the licensing authority deems necessary to investigate the qualifications, character, competency and integrity of the applicant. If the applicant is a corporation, limited liability company, partnership or association, the application shall contain the information required by this subsection for each individual who is or will be an officer, shareholder, financial backer or creditor, other than a financial institution, of such entity or any other individual with a relationship to such entity similar to that of an officer, shareholder, financial backer or creditor.\n\n(e) The application for such license and any renewal thereof shall contain information on any Internet web site or account used by such applicant to conduct the business. During the term of the license, the licensee shall notify the licensing authority in writing of the addition or discontinuation of any Internet web sites or accounts used to conduct the business.\n\n(f) No license shall be issued under this section by the licensing authority to any person who has been convicted of a felony. The licensing authority may require any applicant, employee or person with an ownership interest in the business to submit to state and national criminal history records checks. Whenever the licensing authority requires such criminal history records checks, such individual shall submit two complete sets of fingerprints on forms prescribed by the licensing authority. Any criminal history records checks required pursuant to this subsection shall be conducted in accordance with section 29-17a . The licensing authority may charge the individual a fee equal to the fees established by the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the State Police Bureau of Identification for performing such criminal history records checks.\n\n(g) The licensing authority shall grant or deny an application for a license not later than ninety days after the filing of such application with the licensing authority. A licensee seeking renewal of such license shall file an application for renewal at least sixty days before the expiration of such license and the licensing authority shall grant or deny such renewal not later than thirty days after the filing of such application for renewal. Failure of the licensing authority to act on such initial application or renewal application within the applicable period specified in this subsection shall be deemed to be a denial. The licensing authority may suspend, revoke or modify any license issued under this section at any time during the period of the license for good cause shown, upon notice to the licensee and following a hearing. The licensing authority shall hold any such hearing not later than five days after the date of issuance of such notice, and shall issue a decision not more than fourteen days after any hearing. Any person aggrieved by any action of the licensing authority in denying, suspending, revoking, modifying or refusing to renew a license issued pursuant to this section may appeal from such action to the Superior Court."

If the park owner refuses to select an appraiser within fifteen days of such notice, the Commissioner of Consumer Protection shall choose an appraiser for the park owner. The costs of all appraisers shall be paid equally by the association and the park owner. Except as otherwise provided in subdivision (5) of this subsection, if, within three hundred sixty-five days from the mailing of the notice required in subdivision (2) of this subsection, no agreement for such sale signed by the association and the park owner has been filed upon the land records, or if the association has not filed a certified statement to purchase the park at the appraised value which value shall also be certified on the land records by the appraiser or appraisers, the right provided in this subsection to purchase the park shall be void and any recorded notice filed pursuant to subdivision (3) of this subsection shall be void.",

              "(2) The petition shall allege the acts specified in subdivision (1) of this subsection and, in addition, shall allege supporting facts which demonstrate that the owner of the mobile manufactured home has failed or refused to make reasonable efforts to remove the home from the lot or to sell the home in place or that, in spite of reasonable efforts to locate the owner of the mobile manufactured home or such owner's representative, the owner of the mobile manufactured home park has been unable to locate such owner. Reasonable efforts to locate the owner of the mobile manufactured home shall include, but not be limited to, reasonable inquiry of relatives or associates of the owner of the home, if known to the owner of the park, and of other residents of the park.",
              "(3) A copy of the petition and the notice of the hearing on the petition shall be given to the owner of the mobile manufactured home, the municipality and all lienholders who have recorded a lien against the mobile manufactured home or of whom the owner of the mobile manufactured home park has actual knowledge. Notice to the municipality and to lienholders shall be by certified mail. Notice to the owner of the mobile manufactured home shall be designed to maximize the likelihood that the owner will receive actual notice of the petition, without regard to whether the owner appeared in the summary process action. Such notice to the owner of the mobile manufactured home shall be conspicuously posted at the entrance to the mobile manufactured home and also sent by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested, to the owner of the mobile manufactured home and to the attorney, if any, who appeared for such owner in the summary process action. Notice to the owner of the mobile manufactured home shall be sent to such owner at the owner's last-known address and also to such owner in care of any other person reasonably believed to know the location of the owner. The court may require supplemental notice if it finds that additional notice is likely to result in actual notice to the owner of the mobile manufactured home.",
              "(4) At the hearing on the petition, the court shall determine whether all the requirements of subdivisions (1), (2) and (3) of this subsection have been satisfied and, if they have, shall also determine whether the home has been abandoned. If such requirements have been satisfied and such home has been abandoned, the court shall order the owner of the mobile manufactured home park to conduct a public sale of the home. Nothing in this section shall preclude the court from deferring the entry of an order requiring sale and from issuing other appropriate orders, if the court finds that, within a reasonable period of time, the owner of the mobile manufactured home will remove the home from the lot or dispose of the home by sale or will make other appropriate arrangements with the park owner. The order directing sale shall require notice which includes a conspicuous statement that the sale will extinguish all previous ownership and lien rights. Notice shall be given by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested, to all persons entitled to notice of the petition. Notice shall also be posted conspicuously at the entrance of the home and shall be advertised at least three times in the real estate section of a daily paper with general circulation in the area where the park is situated. Any person, including a lienholder or the owner of the mobile manufactured home park, may bid at the sale. The proceeds of such sale shall be applied first to the costs of the sale and then to the payment of lienholders in the order of the priority of their liens. If proceeds remain thereafter they shall be paid over to the owner of the mobile manufactured home. Upon conclusion of the sale, the park owner shall file an affidavit with the court setting forth the nature of its compliance with the court's order of sale. The court, upon finding compliance with its order, shall issue a conveyance of title and release of liens, if any, to the purchaser for filing in the land records, which shall constitute good title to the home, and no execution shall issue on the original summary process action."

If such breach can be remedied by repair by the resident or payment of damages by the resident to the owner and such breach is not so remedied within twenty-one days, the rental agreement shall terminate except that (A) if the breach is remediable by repairs or the payment of damages and the resident adequately remedies the breach within said twenty-one-day period, the rental agreement shall not terminate, or (B) if substantially the same act or omission for which notice was given recurs within six months, the owner may terminate the rental agreement in accordance with the provisions of sections 47a-23 to 47a-23b , inclusive. For the purposes of this subdivision, “serious nuisance” means (i) inflicting bodily harm upon another resident or the owner or threatening to inflict such harm with the present ability to effect the harm and under circumstances which would lead a reasonable person to believe that such threat will be carried out, (ii) substantial and wilful destruction of part of the premises, (iii) conduct which presents an immediate and serious danger to the safety of other residents or the owner, or (iv) using the premises for prostitution or the illegal sale of drugs. If the owner elects to evict based upon an allegation, pursuant to subdivision (8) of subsection (b) of section 21-82 , that the resident failed to require other persons on the premises with the resident's consent to conduct themselves in a manner that will not constitute a serious nuisance, and the resident claims to have had no knowledge of such conduct, then, if the owner establishes that the premises have been used for the illegal sale of drugs, the burden shall be on the resident to show that the resident had no knowledge of the creation of the serious nuisance.\n\n(3) Notwithstanding the provisions of section 47a-23 , termination of any tenancy in a mobile manufactured home park shall be effective only if made in the following manner:\n\n(A) By the resident giving at least thirty days' notice to the owner;\n\n(B) By the owner giving the resident at least sixty days' written notice, which shall state the reason or reasons for such termination, except that, when termination is based upon subparagraph (A) of subdivision (1) of this subsection, the owner need give the resident only thirty days' written notice, which notice shall state the total arrearage due provided, the owner shall not maintain or proceed with a summary process action against a resident who tenders the total arrearage due to the owner within such thirty days and who has not so tendered an arrearage under this subparagraph during the preceding twelve months.\n\n(4) Except as otherwise specified, proceedings under this section shall be as prescribed by chapter 832.\n\n(5) Nothing in this subsection shall prohibit an owner from increasing the rent at the termination of the rental agreement if (A) the owner delivers a written notice of the proposed rent increase to the resident at least thirty days before the start of a new rental agreement; (B) the proposed rent is consistent with rents for comparable lots in the same park; and (C) the rent is not increased in order to defeat the purpose of this subsection.\n\n(c) Notwithstanding the provisions of sections 47a-35 and 47a-36 , if judgment is entered in a summary process action against a mobile manufactured home owner and resident based upon subparagraph (D) of subdivision (1) of subsection (b) of this section, execution shall not issue until six months from the date of such judgment. The court shall condition such stay of execution upon a requirement that the mobile manufactured home owner and resident make payments to the plaintiff in the summary process action in such installments as the court may direct for the use and occupancy of the premises during the period of such stay at the rate for which such mobile manufactured home owner and resident was most recently liable as rent or in such other sum as is reasonable.\n\n(d) Notwithstanding the provisions of sections 47a-35 and 47a-36 , if judgment is entered in a summary process action against a resident who owns the mobile manufactured home, the resident may, prior to the expiration of the automatic stay of execution provided in section 47a-35 or 47a-36 , as applicable, move for permission to exercise in good faith the resident's right to sell the mobile manufactured home in place in the mobile manufactured home park, subject to the provisions of section 21-79 , and the court may stay execution upon such judgment pending sale of the home. Such stay may be ordered for a period or periods in an aggregate not to exceed twelve months from the date of the judgment in the summary process action, except that any such stay or stays extending beyond six months from the date of the judgment in the summary process action shall be reviewed every two months to determine that the resident is making a good faith effort to sell the home. The court shall condition such stay of execution upon a requirement that the resident make payments to the plaintiff in the summary process action in such installments as the court may direct for the use and occupancy of the premises during the period of such stay at the rate for which such resident was most recently liable as rent or in such other amount as is reasonable and may, in addition, impose other reasonable terms and conditions on the stay. If there is a rental arrearage at the time of the entry of the order, the court shall order that it be paid out of the proceeds of the sale, except that the court, upon finding that the resident has the present ability to pay the arrearage, may require that all or part of such arrearage be paid as a condition of the stay.\n\n(e) (1) If (A) a judgment for possession has been entered against the resident and all occupants of a mobile manufactured home pursuant to chapter 832 and this section; (B) no rent or other payment has been received for the use and occupancy of the lot upon which the mobile manufactured home is situated for at least four months; (C) at least sixty days have passed since the expiration of the last stay of execution pursuant to chapter 832 and this section; and (D) notwithstanding the provisions of section 47a-42 , the mobile manufactured home remains upon the lot, the owner of the mobile manufactured home park may initiate a petition to the Superior Court pursuant to this section. Such petition may be brought as a supplemental proceeding in the summary process action, in which case no additional entry fee shall be required.\n\n(2) The petition shall allege the acts specified in subdivision (1) of this subsection and, in addition, shall allege supporting facts which demonstrate that the owner of the mobile manufactured home has failed or refused to make reasonable efforts to remove the home from the lot or to sell the home in place or that, in spite of reasonable efforts to locate the owner of the mobile manufactured home or such owner's representative, the owner of the mobile manufactured home park has been unable to locate such owner. Reasonable efforts to locate the owner of the mobile manufactured home shall include, but not be limited to, reasonable inquiry of relatives or associates of the owner of the home, if known to the owner of the park, and of other residents of the park.\n\n(3) A copy of the petition and the notice of the hearing on the petition shall be given to the owner of the mobile manufactured home, the municipality and all lienholders who have recorded a lien against the mobile manufactured home or of whom the owner of the mobile manufactured home park has actual knowledge. Notice to the municipality and to lienholders shall be by certified mail. Notice to the owner of the mobile manufactured home shall be designed to maximize the likelihood that the owner will receive actual notice of the petition, without regard to whether the owner appeared in the summary process action. Such notice to the owner of the mobile manufactured home shall be conspicuously posted at the entrance to the mobile manufactured home and also sent by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested, to the owner of the mobile manufactured home and to the attorney, if any, who appeared for such owner in the summary process action. Notice to the owner of the mobile manufactured home shall be sent to such owner at the owner's last-known address and also to such owner in care of any other person reasonably believed to know the location of the owner. The court may require supplemental notice if it finds that additional notice is likely to result in actual notice to the owner of the mobile manufactured home.\n\n(4) At the hearing on the petition, the court shall determine whether all the requirements of subdivisions (1), (2) and (3) of this subsection have been satisfied and, if they have, shall also determine whether the home has been abandoned. If such requirements have been satisfied and such home has been abandoned, the court shall order the owner of the mobile manufactured home park to conduct a public sale of the home. Nothing in this section shall preclude the court from deferring the entry of an order requiring sale and from issuing other appropriate orders, if the court finds that, within a reasonable period of time, the owner of the mobile manufactured home will remove the home from the lot or dispose of the home by sale or will make other appropriate arrangements with the park owner. The order directing sale shall require notice which includes a conspicuous statement that the sale will extinguish all previous ownership and lien rights. Notice shall be given by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested, to all persons entitled to notice of the petition. Notice shall also be posted conspicuously at the entrance of the home and shall be advertised at least three times in the real estate section of a daily paper with general circulation in the area where the park is situated. Any person, including a lienholder or the owner of the mobile manufactured home park, may bid at the sale. The proceeds of such sale shall be applied first to the costs of the sale and then to the payment of lienholders in the order of the priority of their liens. If proceeds remain thereafter they shall be paid over to the owner of the mobile manufactured home. Upon conclusion of the sale, the park owner shall file an affidavit with the court setting forth the nature of its compliance with the court's order of sale. The court, upon finding compliance with its order, shall issue a conveyance of title and release of liens, if any, to the purchaser for filing in the land records, which shall constitute good title to the home, and no execution shall issue on the original summary process action."

Such person shall pay an annual fee of ten dollars for such license. The license may be revocable for cause, which shall include, but not be limited to, failure to comply with any requirements for licensure specified by the licensing authority at the time of issuance. The licensing authority shall refuse to issue a license under this subsection to a person who (1) has been convicted of a felony, or (2) fails to provide evidence that such person holds the permit provided for in section 12-409 , has a Connecticut tax registration number and is registered with the Secretary of the State to do business in this state. The licensing authority may require any applicant for a license to submit to state and national criminal history records checks. If the licensing authority requires such criminal history records checks, such checks shall be conducted in accordance with section 29-17a . For the purposes of this subsection “wholesaler” means a person in the business of selling tangible personal property to be resold at retail or raw materials to be manufactured into suitable forms for use by consumers.\n\n(b) Any person who wilfully engages in the business of a precious metals or stones dealer unless licensed in accordance with this section or after notice that such person's license has been suspended or revoked shall be guilty of a class D felony.\n\n(c) No licensee shall purchase gold or gold-plated ware, silver or silver-plated ware, platinum ware, watches, jewelry, precious stones, bullion or coins without receiving proof of the identity of the person selling the property if such person is not a wholesaler. Such identification shall include a photograph, an address, if available on the identification, and an identifying number, including, but not limited to, date of birth.\n\n(d) (1) Each licensee shall maintain a record-keeping system in which shall be entered in English, at the time the licensee purchases any gold or gold-plated ware, silver or silver-plated ware, platinum ware, watches, jewelry or precious stones, a description of such property and the name, the residence address, the proof of identity as required by this section and a general description of the person from whom, and the date and hour when, such property was purchased and in which, if the property does not contain any identifiable numbers or markings, shall be included a digital photograph of such property. Except as provided in subsection (f) of this section, the description of any such property purchased by a licensee under this section shall include, but not be limited to, all distinguishing marks, names of any kind, including brand and model names, model and serial numbers, engravings, etchings, affiliation with any institution or organization, dates, initials, color, vintage or image represented.\n\n(2) Any licensee who purchases bullion or coins shall, at the time of such purchase, enter in such record-keeping system in English a description of the bullion or coins purchased and the name, the residence address, the proof of identity as required by this section and a general description of the person from whom, and the date and hour when, such bullion or coins were purchased.\n\n(3) Each entry in such record-keeping system shall be numbered consecutively.

If the dealer claims an ownership interest in such property, the dealer may request the return of such property by filing a request for such property with the law enforcement agency in accordance with the provisions of section 54-36a . If the seller of any property purchased by the dealer is convicted of any offense arising out of the dealer's acquisition of the property and the dealer suffered an economic loss as a result of such offense, the court may, at the time of sentencing, order restitution to the dealer pursuant to subsection (c) of section 53a-28 , which order may be enforced in accordance with section 53a-28a .\n\n(n) Any person who violates any provision of this section, for which no other penalty is provided, shall be fined not more than one thousand dollars."
