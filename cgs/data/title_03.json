In the event that the Treasurer determines that divestment of state funds is warranted from a company in which state funds are invested due to such company doing business in Iran, the Treasurer shall give notice to such company that such funds shall be divested from such company for as long as such company does business in Iran.\n\n(d) The State Treasurer shall, at least once per fiscal year, provide a report to the Investment Advisory Council on actions taken by the Treasurer pursuant to the provisions of this section.\n\n(e) The provisions of this section shall no longer be effective if both of the following occur: (1) Iran is no longer designated by the United States Department of State as a country that is a state sponsor of terrorism due to said department's determination that the country repeatedly provides support for acts of international terrorism; and (2) the President of the United States certifies to the appropriate committee of Congress, pursuant to P.L. 104-172, as amended from time to time, that Iran has ceased its efforts to design, develop, manufacture or acquire a nuclear explosive device or related materials and technology."

If the request includes a recommendation that some amount of such federal, private or other moneys should be added to such state moneys, then, if and to the extent directed by the State Bond Commission at the time of authorization of such bonds, such amount of such federal, private or other moneys then available, or thereafter to be made available for costs in connection with such project, may be added to any state moneys available or becoming available for such project and shall be used for such project.

Pending use of the federal, private or other moneys so received to meet principal as directed in this subsection, the amount of such moneys may be invested by the State Treasurer in bonds or obligation of, or guaranteed by, the state or the United States or agencies or instrumentalities of the United States, shall be deemed to be part of the debt retirement funds of the state, and net earnings on such investments shall be used in the same manner as the moneys so invested.",

The State Bond Commission shall establish such rate or rates in order to achieve the goals and purposes of such loan programs, to achieve the best interests of the state and, to the extent deemed necessary or desirable by the State Bond Commission, to comply with the requirements of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, or any subsequent corresponding internal revenue code of the United States, as from time to time amended, and regulations promulgated thereunder.\n\n(u) Notwithstanding any other provision of this section or of any bond act, bonds, refunding bonds, notes or other obligations in anticipation thereof authorized and issued under this section may include contract provisions for (1) the payment of interest either (A) at certain rates in the event such interest is excludable from the gross income of the holders or owners thereof under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, or any subsequent corresponding internal revenue code of the United States, as from time to time amended, or (B) at certain other rates in the event such interest is includable in the gross income of the holders or owners thereof under the Internal Revenue Service Code of 1986, or any subsequent corresponding internal revenue code of the United States, as from time to time amended, (2) the payment by the state of such costs and expenses as may be incurred by the holders or owners of such obligations pursuant to the contract with the state as a result thereof, and (3) other terms as the Treasurer shall determine to be in the best interests of the state.

Nothing in this section shall be construed to preclude the defense of governmental immunity to any such claim, demand or suit. For purposes of this subsection “official” means any person elected or appointed to office or any state employee. This subsection shall not apply to cases of wilful and wanton fraud.\n\n(x) Notwithstanding any provision of the general statutes, public acts or special acts, any sale, lease or other disposition to or use by a nongovernmental entity of all or a portion of any project financed with proceeds of bonds of the state the interest on which is not included in gross income pursuant to Section 103 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, or any subsequent corresponding internal revenue code of the United States, as amended from time to time, that would otherwise cause such bonds to be treated as private activity bonds within the meaning of Section 141 of said internal revenue code shall be subject to the prior approval of the Treasurer. The Treasurer is authorized to transfer all or a portion of the proceeds received with respect to and at the time of such disposition or use, in an amount not less than the amount required by said internal revenue code to preserve the exclusion from gross income of interest on such bonds, (1) to the General Fund to pay debt service on, including redemption, defeasance or purchase of, outstanding bonds of the state the interest on which is not included in gross income pursuant to Section 103 of said internal revenue code, (2) with the approval of the State Bond Commission, in lieu of the issuance of bonds, to the appropriate account or fund for any projects or purposes authorized by the State Bond Commission pursuant to a bond act and with the same force and effect as bond proceeds, thereby reducing the authority to issue bonds by such dollar amount, provided in any event that any such transfer does not cause the interest on the subject bonds to become included in gross income pursuant to Section 103 of said internal revenue code.\n\n(y) For the purposes of this subsection, “state moneys” means the proceeds of the sale of bonds authorized pursuant to this section, or of temporary notes issued in anticipation of the moneys to be derived from the sale of such bonds. Each request filed for an authorization of bonds shall identify the project for which the proceeds of the sale of such bonds are to be used and, in addition to any terms and conditions required pursuant to this section, shall include the recommendation of the person signing such request as to the extent to which federal, private or other moneys then available or thereafter to be made available for costs in connection with any such project should be added to the state moneys available or becoming available for such project. If the request includes a recommendation that some amount of such federal, private or other moneys should be added to such state moneys, then, if and to the extent directed by the State Bond Commission at the time of authorization of such bonds, such amount of such federal, private or other moneys then available, or thereafter to be made available for costs in connection with such project, may be added to any state moneys available or becoming available for such project and shall be used for such project. Any other federal, private or other moneys then available or to be made available for costs in connection with such project shall, upon receipt, be used by the State Treasurer, in conformity with applicable federal and state law, to meet the principal of outstanding bonds issued pursuant to this section, or to meet the principal of temporary notes issued in anticipation of the money to be derived from the sale of bonds authorized pursuant to this section, for the purpose of financing such costs, either by purchase or redemption and cancellation of such bonds or notes, or by payment of such notes at maturity. Whenever any of the federal, private or other moneys so received with respect to such project are used to meet the principal of such temporary notes or whenever principal of any such temporary notes is retired by application of such federal, private or other moneys, the amounts of bonds authorized in anticipation of which such temporary notes were issued, and the aggregate amount of bonds which may be authorized, shall each be reduced by the amount of the principal so met or retired.

The Treasurer shall base such determination on such factors as the Treasurer shall deem relevant, which may include advice from financial advisors to the state, historical trading patterns of outstanding state general obligation bonds and spreads to common municipal bond indexes. The Treasurer shall set out such estimated savings for each fiscal year during which each issue of credit revenue bonds shall be stated to be outstanding in a bond determination which shall be filed with the State Bond Commission at or prior to the issuance of such credit revenue bonds, and such amounts shall be dedicated savings for purposes of this section.",

              "(2) On and after July 1, 2025, notwithstanding subsection (f) of section 3-20 , (A) net earnings of investments of proceeds of bonds issued pursuant to section 3-20 or pursuant to this section and accrued interest on the issuance of such bonds shall be deposited to the credit of the General Fund, and (B) premiums, net of any original issue discount, on the issuance of such bonds shall, after payment of any expenses incurred by the Treasurer or State Bond Commission in connection with such issuance, be deposited at the direction of the Treasurer to the credit of an account or fund to fund all or a portion of any purpose or project authorized by the State Bond Commission pursuant to any bond act up to the amount authorized by the State Bond Commission, provided the bonds for such purpose or project are unissued, and provided further the certificate of determination the Treasurer files with the secretary of the State Bond Commission for such authorized bonds sets forth the amount of the deposit applied to fund each such purpose and project. Upon such filing, the Treasurer shall record bonds in the amount of net premiums credited to each purpose and project as set forth in the certificate of determination of the Treasurer as deemed issued and retired and the Treasurer shall not thereafter exercise authority to issue bonds in such amount for such purpose or project. Upon such recording by the Treasurer, such bonds shall be deemed to have been issued, retired and no longer authorized for issuance or outstanding for the purposes of section 3-21 , and for the purpose of aligning the funding of such authorized purpose and project with amounts generated by net premiums, but shall not constitute an actual bond issuance or bond retirement for any other purposes including, but not limited to, financial reporting purposes.",
              "(q) Any general obligation bonds or notes issued pursuant to section 3-20 may be refunded by credit revenue bonds or notes issued pursuant to this section, and any credit revenue bonds issued pursuant to this section may be refunded by general obligation bonds or notes issued pursuant to subsection (g) of section 3-20 in the manner, and subject to the same conditions, as set out in subsection (g) of section 3-20 ."

Proceeds from investments authorized by this subsection, less amounts required under the proceedings authorizing the issuance of bonds, shall be credited to the General Fund.\n\n(l) Bonds issued pursuant to this section are hereby made securities in which all public officers and public bodies of the state and its political subdivisions, all insurance companies, credit unions, building and loan associations, investment companies, banking associations, trust companies, executors, administrators, trustees and other fiduciaries and pension, profit-sharing and retirement funds may properly and legally invest funds, including capital in their control or belonging to them.

The State Bond Commission is authorized to include this covenant of the state in any agreement with the owner of any such bonds.\n\n(n) At the time of issuance of any credit revenue bonds pursuant to this section, the Treasurer shall determine the amount of principal and interest estimated to be saved by the issuance of credit revenue bonds instead of general obligation bonds, as measured by the difference between the stated principal and interest payable with respect to such credit revenue bonds in each fiscal year during which bonds shall be outstanding, and the principal and interest estimated to be payable in each fiscal year during which such bonds would have been outstanding had such bonds been issued as general obligation bonds payable over the same period on the basis of equal amounts of principal stated to be due in each fiscal year, subject to any specific adjustments which the Treasurer may consider appropriate to take into account in the structure for a specific bond issue, provided in any fiscal year that the Treasurer determines there are no savings, the estimated savings shall be zero for such fiscal year. The Treasurer shall base such determination on such factors as the Treasurer shall deem relevant, which may include advice from financial advisors to the state, historical trading patterns of outstanding state general obligation bonds and spreads to common municipal bond indexes. The Treasurer shall set out such estimated savings for each fiscal year during which each issue of credit revenue bonds shall be stated to be outstanding in a bond determination which shall be filed with the State Bond Commission at or prior to the issuance of such credit revenue bonds, and such amounts shall be dedicated savings for purposes of this section.\n\n(o) For each fiscal year during which credit revenue bonds shall be outstanding, there shall be transferred from the General Fund of the state to the Budget Reserve Fund established pursuant to section 4-30a , at the beginning of such fiscal year, an amount equal to the aggregate dedicated savings for all such bonds issued and to be outstanding in such fiscal year, unless the Governor declares an emergency or the existence of extraordinary circumstances, in which the provisions of section 4-85 are invoked, and at least three-fifths of the members of each chamber of the General Assembly vote to diminish such required transfer during the fiscal year for which the emergency or existence of extraordinary circumstances are determined, or in such other circumstances as may be permitted by the terms of the bonds, notes or other obligations issued pursuant to this section. Amounts so transferred shall not be available for appropriation for any other purpose, but shall only be used as provided in section 4-30a .\n\n(p) (1) Prior to July 1, 2025, net earnings of investments of proceeds of bonds issued pursuant to section 3-20 or pursuant to this section and accrued interest on the issuance of such bonds and premiums on the issuance of such bonds shall be deposited to the credit of the General Fund, after (A) payment of any expenses incurred by the Treasurer or State Bond Commission in connection with such issuance, or (B) application to interest on bonds, notes or other obligations of the state.\n\n(2) On and after July 1, 2025, notwithstanding subsection (f) of section 3-20 , (A) net earnings of investments of proceeds of bonds issued pursuant to section 3-20 or pursuant to this section and accrued interest on the issuance of such bonds shall be deposited to the credit of the General Fund, and (B) premiums, net of any original issue discount, on the issuance of such bonds shall, after payment of any expenses incurred by the Treasurer or State Bond Commission in connection with such issuance, be deposited at the direction of the Treasurer to the credit of an account or fund to fund all or a portion of any purpose or project authorized by the State Bond Commission pursuant to any bond act up to the amount authorized by the State Bond Commission, provided the bonds for such purpose or project are unissued, and provided further the certificate of determination the Treasurer files with the secretary of the State Bond Commission for such authorized bonds sets forth the amount of the deposit applied to fund each such purpose and project. Upon such filing, the Treasurer shall record bonds in the amount of net premiums credited to each purpose and project as set forth in the certificate of determination of the Treasurer as deemed issued and retired and the Treasurer shall not thereafter exercise authority to issue bonds in such amount for such purpose or project. Upon such recording by the Treasurer, such bonds shall be deemed to have been issued, retired and no longer authorized for issuance or outstanding for the purposes of section 3-21 , and for the purpose of aligning the funding of such authorized purpose and project with amounts generated by net premiums, but shall not constitute an actual bond issuance or bond retirement for any other purposes including, but not limited to, financial reporting purposes.\n\n(q) Any general obligation bonds or notes issued pursuant to section 3-20 may be refunded by credit revenue bonds or notes issued pursuant to this section, and any credit revenue bonds issued pursuant to this section may be refunded by general obligation bonds or notes issued pursuant to subsection (g) of section 3-20 in the manner, and subject to the same conditions, as set out in subsection (g) of section 3-20 ."

In the event that the Treasurer determines that divestment of state funds is warranted from a company in which state funds are invested due to such company doing business in Sudan, the Treasurer shall give notice to such company that such funds shall be divested from such company for as long as such company does business in Sudan.\n\n(d) The State Treasurer shall, at least once per fiscal year, provide reports to the Investment Advisory Council on actions taken by the Treasurer pursuant to the provisions of this section.\n\n(e) In the event that the President of the United States rescinds or repeals Executive Order 13067 the provisions of this section shall no longer be effective."

The issuance of abandoned property fund bonds shall not directly or indirectly or contingently obligate the state or any political subdivision thereof to levy or to pledge any form of taxation whatever therefor, or to make any additional appropriation for their payment. Such abandoned property fund bonds shall not constitute a charge, lien or encumbrance, legal or equitable, upon any property of the state or of any political subdivision thereof other than the pledged receipts, funds or moneys pledged therefor and deposited in the Special Abandoned Property Fund and the substance of such limitation shall be plainly stated on each such abandoned property fund bond. Notwithstanding any other provision of the general statutes, abandoned property fund bonds shall not be subject to any statutory limitation on the indebtedness of the state, and, when issued, shall not be included in computing the aggregate indebtedness of the state in respect of and to the extent of any such limitation. As part of the contract of the state with the owners of the abandoned property fund bonds, all amounts necessary for the punctual payment of the debt service requirements with respect to the abandoned property fund bonds shall be deemed appropriated, but only from the sources pledged pursuant to this section.\n\n(h) The abandoned property fund bonds may be issued if after authorization the Treasurer and the Secretary of the Office of Policy and Management find that such issuance is necessary to disburse funds to the General Fund in support of state programs.\n\n(i) The abandoned property fund bonds may be executed and delivered at the time or times, shall be dated, shall bear interest at the rate or rates, shall mature at the time or times not exceeding seven years from their date, have the rank or priority, be payable in the medium of payment, be issued in coupon or in registered form, or both, carry the registration and transfer privileges and be made redeemable before maturity at the price or prices and under the terms and conditions, all as may be provided by the proceedings and the Treasurer shall continue to deposit all abandoned property receipts in the Special Abandoned Property Fund to pay the abandoned property fund bonds until such bonds are fully discharged.\n\n(j) All of the provisions of section 3-20 with the exception of subsections (i) and (p) of said section 3-20 and the exercise of any right or power granted thereby which are not inconsistent with the provisions of this section, are hereby adopted and may be invoked in respect to the abandoned property fund bonds authorized pursuant to this section.\n\n(k) Any abandoned property fund bonds may be sold at public sale on sealed proposals or by negotiation in such manner, at such price or prices, at such time or times and on such other terms and conditions of such abandoned property fund bonds and the issuance and sale thereof as the Treasurer may determine to be in the best interests of the state.\n\n(l) The proceedings under which abandoned property fund bonds are authorized to be issued may, subject to the provisions of the general statutes, contain any or all of the following: (1) Provisions respecting custody of the proceeds from the sale of the abandoned property fund bonds, including any requirements that such proceeds be held separate from or not be commingled with other funds of the state;

(6) covenants for the establishment of pledged revenue coverage requirements for the abandoned property fund bonds; (7) provisions for the issuance of additional abandoned property fund bonds on a parity with abandoned property fund bonds theretofore issued, including establishment of coverage requirements with respect thereto as provided in this subsection; (8) provisions regarding the rights and remedies available in case of a default to the bondowners, or any trustee under any contract, document, instrument or indenture of trust, including the right to appoint a trustee to represent their interests upon occurrence of an event of default, as defined in said proceedings, provided if any abandoned property fund bonds shall be secured by an indenture of trust, the respective owners of such abandoned property fund bonds shall have no authority except as set forth in such trust indenture to appoint a separate trustee to represent them;

Such lien shall be valid and binding from the time when the pledge is made. The lien of any pledge shall be valid and binding as against all parties having claims of any kind in tort, contract or otherwise against the state, including but not limited to a claim pursuant to sections 3-56a to 3-76 , inclusive, irrespective of whether the parties have notice of the claims. Notwithstanding any provision of the Uniform Commercial Code, neither this section, the indenture of trust, the proceedings nor any other instrument by which a pledge is created need be recorded. Any revenues or other receipts, funds or moneys so pledged and thereafter credited to and held in the Special Abandoned Property Fund shall be subject immediately to the lien of the pledge without any physical delivery thereof or further act and such lien shall have priority over all other liens.\n\n(n) Abandoned property fund bonds may be secured by an indenture of trust by and between the state and a corporate trustee, which may be any trust company or bank having the powers of a trust company within or without the state. Such indenture of trust may contain such provisions for protecting and enforcing the rights and remedies of the bondowners as may be reasonable and proper and not in violation of law, including covenants setting forth the custody, safeguarding and application of all moneys. The state may provide by such indenture of trust for the payment of the pledged revenues or other receipts, funds or moneys to the trustee under such indenture of trust or to any other depository, and for the method of disbursement thereof, with such safeguards and restrictions as it may determine. All expenses incurred in carrying out such indenture of trust may be treated as Special Abandoned Property Fund financing costs.\n\n(o) The Treasurer shall have power to purchase abandoned property fund bonds issued pursuant to this section out of any funds available therefor. The Treasurer may hold, pledge, cancel or resell such abandoned property fund bonds subject to and in accordance with agreements with bondowners.\n\n(p) Whether or not any abandoned property fund bonds issued pursuant to this section are of the form and character to qualify as negotiable instruments under the terms of title 42a, the abandoned property fund bonds are hereby made negotiable instruments within the meaning of and for all purposes of said title 42a, subject only to the provisions of the abandoned property fund bonds.\n\n(q) Any moneys held by the Treasurer or by a trustee pursuant to an indenture of trust with respect to abandoned property fund bonds including pledged revenues, other pledged receipts, funds or moneys and proceeds from the sale of such abandoned property fund bonds, may, pending the use or application of the proceeds thereof for an authorized purpose, be (1) invested and reinvested in such obligations, securities and investments as are set forth in subsection (f) of section 3-20 and in participation certificates in the Short Term Investment Funds created under sections 3-27a and 3-27f , or (2) deposited or redeposited in such bank or banks as shall be provided in the proceedings. Unless the proceedings provide otherwise, proceeds from investments authorized by this subsection, less amounts required under the proceedings authorizing the issuance of abandoned property fund bonds for the payment of Special Abandoned Property Fund financing costs relating to such abandoned property fund bonds, shall be credited to the Special Abandoned Property Fund.\n\n(r) Any abandoned property fund bonds at any time outstanding may, at any time and from time to time, be refunded by the state by the issuance of its refunding abandoned property fund bonds in such amounts as the Treasurer may deem necessary, but not to exceed an amount sufficient to refund the principal of the abandoned property fund bonds to be so refunded, to pay any unpaid interest on such abandoned property fund bonds and any premiums and commissions necessary to be paid in connection with such abandoned property fund bonds and to pay costs and expenses which the Treasurer may deem necessary or advantageous in connection with the authorization, sale and issuance of refunding abandoned property fund bonds. Any such refunding may be effected whether the abandoned property fund bonds to be refunded shall have matured or shall thereafter mature. All refunding abandoned property fund bonds issued under this subsection shall be payable solely from the revenues or other receipts, funds or moneys out of which the abandoned property fund bonds to be refunded thereby are payable and shall be subject to and may be secured in accordance with the provisions of this section.\n\n(s) The state covenants with the purchasers and all subsequent owners and transferees of abandoned property fund bonds, in consideration of the acceptance of and payment for the abandoned property fund bonds, that the principal and interest of such abandoned property fund bonds shall be free from taxation at all times, except for estate and gift, franchise and excise taxes, imposed by the state or any political subdivision thereof. The Treasurer is authorized to include this covenant of the state in any agreement with the owner of any such abandoned property fund bonds.\n\n(t) Abandoned property fund bonds issued pursuant to this section are hereby made securities in which all public officers and public bodies of the state and its political subdivisions, all insurance companies, credit unions, building and loan associations, investment companies, banking associations, trust companies, executors, administrators, trustees and other fiduciaries and pension, profit-sharing and retirement funds may properly and legally invest funds, including capital in their control or belonging to them. Such abandoned property fund bonds are hereby made securities which may properly and legally be deposited with and received by any state or municipal officer or any agency or political subdivision of the state for any purpose for which the deposit of bonds or obligations of the state is now or may hereafter be authorized by law.\n\n(u) The state covenants with the purchasers and all subsequent owners and transferees of abandoned property fund bonds issued by the state pursuant to this section in consideration of the acceptance of the payment for the abandoned property fund bonds, until such abandoned property fund bonds, together with the interest thereon, with interest on any unpaid installment of interest and all costs and expenses in connection with any action or proceeding on behalf of such owners, are fully met and discharged, or unless expressly permitted or otherwise authorized by the terms of each contract and agreement made or entered into by or on behalf of the state with or for the benefit of such owners, that the state will apply the pledged revenues and other receipts, funds or moneys pledged for the payment of debt service requirements as provided in this section, in such amounts as may be necessary to pay such debt service requirements in each year in which such abandoned property fund bonds are outstanding and further, that the state (1) will not limit or alter the duties imposed on the Treasurer and other officers of the state by this section, and by the proceedings authorizing the issuance of abandoned property fund bonds with respect to application of pledged revenues or other receipts, funds or moneys pledged for the payment of debt service requirements as provided in this section; (2) will not issue any bonds, notes or other evidences of indebtedness, other than the abandoned property fund bonds, having any rights arising out of this section or secured by any pledge of or other lien or charge on the pledged revenues or other receipts, funds or moneys pledged for the payment of debt service requirements as provided in this section; (3) will not create or cause to be created any lien or charge on such pledged amounts, other than a lien or pledge created thereon pursuant to this section, provided nothing in this subsection shall prevent the state from issuing evidences of indebtedness (A) which are secured by a pledge or lien which is and shall on the face thereof be expressly subordinate and junior in all respects to every lien and pledge created by or pursuant to this section; or (B) for which the full faith and credit of the state is pledged and which are not expressly secured by any specific lien or charge on such pledged amounts; or (C) which are secured by a pledge of or lien on moneys or funds derived on or after such date as every pledge or lien thereon created by or pursuant to this section shall be discharged and satisfied; (4) will carry out and perform, or cause to be carried out and performed, each and every promise, covenant, agreement or contract made or entered into by the state or on its behalf with the owners of any abandoned property fund bonds; (5) will not in any way impair the rights, exemptions or remedies of the owners of abandoned property fund bonds; and (6) will not limit, modify, rescind, repeal or otherwise alter the rights or obligations of the appropriate officers of the state to collect the funds and other receipts constituting the pledged revenues as may be necessary to produce sufficient revenues to fulfill the terms of the proceedings authorizing the issuance of the abandoned property fund bonds, including pledged revenue coverage requirements, and provided, however, nothing in this subsection shall preclude the state from exercising its power to limit, modify, rescind, repeal or otherwise alter the character or amount of such pledged revenues, if and when adequate provisions shall be made by law for the protection of the owners of the outstanding abandoned property fund bonds.

              "(a) Not less than one hundred eighty days before a presumption of abandonment is to take effect in respect to property subject to section 3-60b or 3-60c and within one year before a presumption of abandonment is to take effect in respect to all other property subject to this part, and if the owner's claim is not barred by law, the holder shall notify the owner thereof and take reasonable steps to prevent abandonment from being presumed, at a minimum, by sending such notice by first class mail directed to the owner's last-known address, and, if a holder has received an owner's consent for the electronic delivery of any notices that are required by law, by electronic mail directed to the owner's last-known electronic mail address, that evidence of interest must be indicated as required by this part or such property will be transferred to the Treasurer and will be subject to escheat to the state. If the property presumed abandoned is a security, virtual currency or tangible property from a safe deposit box, the holder's notice shall indicate that such property may be liquidated either prior to or following its reporting to the Treasurer and that after such liquidation will be limited to the proceeds of such liquidation. Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to require an owner to consent to the electronic delivery of notices for communications regarding unclaimed property.",
              "(b) Not later than ninety days after the close of the calendar year in which property is presumed abandoned, the holder shall pay or deliver such property to the Treasurer and file, on forms that the Treasurer shall provide, a report of unclaimed property. Each report shall be verified and shall include: (1) The name, if known, last-known physical and electronic mail address, if any, and last-known telephone number, if any, of each person appearing to be the owner of such property; (2) in case of unclaimed funds of an insurance company, the full name of the insured or annuitant and beneficiary and his or her last-known address appearing on the insurance company's records; (3) the nature and identifying number, if any, or description of the property and the amount appearing from the records to be due; (4) the date when the property became payable, demandable or returnable and the date of the last transaction with the owner with respect to the property; (5) if the holder is a successor to other holders, or if the holder has changed the holder's name, all prior known names and addresses of each holder of the property; and (6) such other information as the Treasurer may require.",

The Treasurer may bring an action in a court of appropriate jurisdiction to enforce the provisions of this part.",

In claiming property from a holder who is also the issuer, the Treasurer's burden of proof as to the existence and amount of the property and its abandonment is satisfied by showing issuance of the instrument and passage of the requisite period of abandonment. Defenses of payment, satisfaction, discharge and want of consideration are affirmative defenses that shall be established by the holder.",

The holder shall complete the sale of such property and deliver the net proceeds to the Treasurer not later than thirty days after filing the report required under subsection (b) of this section. A holder of tangible, personal property may contract with a third party to store and sell such property and to pay the proceeds arising from such sale, excluding any charges that may be lawfully withheld, to the Treasurer, provided the third party holds a surety bond or other form of insurance coverage with respect to such activities. Any holder who sells property pursuant to subsection (a) of section 3-57a or section 3-57b and remits the excess proceeds to the Treasurer or who transmits tangible, personal property to a bonded or insured third party for such purposes, shall not be responsible for any claims related to the sale or transmission of the property or proceeds to the Treasurer. If the Treasurer exempts any such property from being remitted or sold pursuant to this subsection, whether by regulations or guidelines, the holder of such property may dispose of such property in any manner such holder deems appropriate and such holder shall not be responsible for any claims related to the disposition of such property or any claims to the property itself. For purposes of the sale of personal property presumed abandoned under subdivision (5) of subsection (a) of section 3-57a or section 3-57b , charges that may lawfully be withheld include costs of storage, appraisal, advertising and sales commissions as well as lawful charges owing under the contract governing the safe deposit box rental.",
              "(j) In the event military medals are presumed abandoned pursuant to subdivision (5) of subsection (a) of section 3-57a , a banking or financial organization shall transmit such medals to the Department of Veterans Affairs in accordance with procedures established by the Treasurer. The Treasurer and Commissioner of Veterans Affairs shall enter into a memorandum of understanding concerning the handling of such medals and the Department of Veterans Affairs shall hold such medals in custody pursuant to such memorandum. The Treasurer may make any information obtained pursuant to this section, including any photograph or other visual depiction of a military medal but excluding Social Security numbers, available to the public to facilitate the identification of the original owner of such medal or such owner's heirs or beneficiaries."

Any person aggrieved by a decision of the Treasurer may appeal therefrom in accordance with the provisions of section 4-183 , except venue for such appeal shall be in the judicial district of New Britain.\n\n(c) (1) (A) No agreement entered into prior to January 1, 2023, to locate property shall be valid if: (i) Such agreement is entered into (I) within two years after the date a report of unclaimed property is required to be filed under section 3-65a , or (II) between the date such a report is required to be filed under said section and the date it is filed under said section, whichever period is longer; (ii) such agreement is entered into within two years after the date of posting of the notice required by section 3-66a ; or (iii) pursuant to such agreement, any person undertakes to locate property included in a report of unclaimed property that is required to be filed under section 3-65a for a fee or other compensation exceeding ten per cent of the value of the recoverable property.\n\n(B) No agreement entered into on or after January 1, 2023, to locate property shall be valid if: (i) Such agreement is entered into (I) within two years after the date a report of unclaimed property is required to be filed under section 3-65a , or (II) between the date such a report is required to be filed under said section and the date it is filed under said section, whichever period is longer; or (ii) pursuant to such agreement, any person undertakes to locate property included in a report of unclaimed property that is required to be filed under section 3-65a for a fee or other compensation exceeding ten per cent of the value of the recoverable property.\n\n(2) (A) In addition to the requirements set forth in subparagraph (B) of subdivision (1) of this subsection, an agreement entered into prior to January 1, 2025, to locate property shall be valid only if it is in writing, is signed by the owner and discloses the nature and value of the property, and the owner's share after the fee or compensation has been subtracted is clearly stipulated.\n\n(B) In addition to the requirements set forth in subparagraph (B) of subdivision (1) of this subsection, an agreement entered into on or after January 1, 2025, to locate property shall be valid only if such agreement is in writing, is signed by the owner and clearly and conspicuously discloses (i) the nature and value of the property, (ii) the owner's share after the fee or compensation has been subtracted from such value, and (iii) that the owner may file a claim directly with the Treasurer at no cost and the method through which such claim may be filed.\n\n(3) Any solicitation made to locate unclaimed property shall clearly and conspicuously disclose in a written statement that (A) any individual may search for and file a claim for such property directly with the Treasurer at no cost, and (B) the method through which such claim may be filed.\n\n(4) Any claim for unclaimed property filed with the Treasurer pursuant to an agreement or solicitation under this subsection, shall include an unredacted version of any such agreement or solicitation to permit the Treasurer to determine whether such agreement or solicitation complies with the requirements of this subsection.\n\n(5) The Treasurer may withhold payment of a claim for unclaimed property to anyone other than the owner (A) for failure to comply with the requirements of subdivision (4) of this subsection, or (B) if the Treasurer determines that the solicitation or agreement to locate unclaimed property does not comply with any other requirement of this section.\n\n(6) Nothing in this section shall be construed to prevent an owner from asserting, at any time, that an agreement to locate or to otherwise obtain an interest in unclaimed property is based upon excessive or unjust consideration.\n\n(d) The Treasurer shall pay each claim allowed without deduction for costs of notices or sale or for service charges. The Treasurer shall notify the Commissioner of Revenue Services of the payment of claims of five hundred dollars or more to the domiciliary administrator or executor of a deceased owner.\n\n(e) In the case of any claim allowed under this section for property, funds or money delivered to the Treasurer pursuant to subdivision (1) or (2) of subsection (a) of section 3-57a , the Treasurer shall pay such claim with interest as follows: For each calendar year or portion thereof that the property, funds or money has been paid or delivered to the Treasurer, the Treasurer shall pay interest at a rate that is not less than the deposit index, as determined under section 36a-26 , for such year. Such interest shall accrue from the date of payment or delivery of the property, funds or money to the Treasurer until the date of payment or delivery of the property, funds or money to the claimant.\n\n(f) Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (a) of this section, where the amount of a property reported or transferred to the Treasurer under this part is less than two thousand five hundred dollars, the Treasurer shall pay such amount to an individual if the Treasurer has determined (1) that such individual is the sole owner of such property, and (2) to the Treasurer's satisfaction, the current address of such individual.\n\n(g) The Treasurer may make direct payment to one or more claimants, without such claimant having been granted a decree to transfer personal property, been issued a current fiduciary certificate, or secured any other similar document, for any solely owned unclaimed property of a deceased owner valued at less than five hundred dollars in the aggregate at the time of the claim, subject to the following conditions:\n\n(1) If no affidavit in lieu of administration or similar petition has been filed in a Probate Court or more than one year has passed since the last decree to transfer personal property or any other similar document has been issued, upon a claimant furnishing a certified claim and a sworn affidavit under penalty of perjury showing entitlement to such property. Such affidavit shall be in a form prescribed by the Treasurer and shall include, at a minimum, (A) the claimant's affirmation that the claimant is the sole heir, or (B) attestation from all of the other heirs with a valid claim to the property confirming the rightful distribution of the property under the law.\n\n(2) If a fiduciary of a decedent estate has been appointed by a Probate Court, but the decedent's estate was closed more than one year prior to the discovery of the relevant unclaimed property, upon a claimant's furnishing of a certified claim and a sworn affidavit under penalty of perjury showing entitlement to such property. Such affidavit shall be in a form prescribed by the Treasurer and shall include, at a minimum (A) the claimant's affirmation that the claimant is the previously appointed fiduciary and that the claimant shall distribute the funds as required by law; or (B) attestations from any rightful heir or beneficiary consistent with the provisions of subdivision (1) of this subsection.\n\n(3) The payment of the amount due under this section shall constitute a full acquittance and release of the state for the amount paid. Any claimant paid by the Treasurer in good faith shall be answerable concerning such payment to anyone prejudiced by an improper distribution or payment. Except as provided in this subsection, nothing in this section shall be construed to modify or eliminate any of a claimant's responsibilities under any other state or federal law, including, but not limited to, any obligations under title 45a."

It is further found and declared to be in the public interest and to be the policy of the state to assist those municipalities in reducing such cost without discouraging continued investor interest in the purchase of bonds of the municipalities and the state as sound and preferred securities for investment and to encourage such municipalities in refunding such bonds in an orderly manner. It is further found and declared that the state should exercise its powers in the interest of the municipalities and the taxpayers and residents of the state to implement those policies by borrowing money and issuing its bonds to make funds available for the purchase by the state of refunding bonds of the municipalities, and by authorizing the municipalities to refund their bonds to effectuate an interest savings and that the issuance of such bonds by the state and the municipalities pursuant to this part is for a public purpose for which public funds may be expended. The necessity in the public interest and for the public benefit and good for the provisions of this part is hereby declared as a matter of legislative determination."

The Treasurer may carry out the provisions of this section and exercise all of the rights and remedies and provisions of law herein provided or referred to.\n\n(d) To the extent that the Treasurer or any other officer of the state is the custodian of any moneys made available by reason of any grant, allocation or appropriation by the state or agencies thereof payable to a municipality at any time subsequent to the failure of such municipality to pay the principal of or interest on municipal refunding bonds of such municipality then owned or held by the state, the Treasurer or such officer shall withhold the payment of that money from that municipality until the amount of the principal or interest then due and unpaid has been paid to the state, or until the Treasurer or such officer shall determine that arrangements, satisfactory to the Treasurer, have been made for the payment of such principal and interest provided, however, that such moneys shall not be withheld from such defaulting municipality if such withholding will adversely affect the receipt of any federal grant or aid in connection with such moneys."

              "The Attorney General shall appoint a deputy, who shall be sworn to the faithful discharge of his duties and shall perform all the duties of the Attorney General in case of his sickness or absence. He shall appoint such other assistants as he deems necessary, subject to the approval of the Governor. The Attorney General may also appoint not more than four associate attorneys general who will serve at the pleasure of the Attorney General and will be exempt from the classified service. The Attorney General shall have general supervision over all legal matters in which the state is an interested party, except those legal matters over which prosecuting officers have direction. He shall appear for the state, the Governor, the Lieutenant Governor, the Secretary, the Treasurer and the Comptroller, and for all heads of departments and state boards, commissioners, agents, inspectors, committees, auditors, chemists, directors, harbor masters, and institutions and for the State Librarian and the Connecticut Pilot Commission in all suits and other civil proceedings, except upon criminal recognizances and bail bonds, in which the state is a party or is interested, or in which the official acts and doings of said officers are called in question, and for all members of the state House of Representatives and the state Senate in all suits and other civil proceedings brought against them involving their official acts and doings in the discharge of their duties as legislators, in any court or other tribunal, as the duties of his office require; and all such suits shall be conducted by him or under his direction. When any measure affecting the State Treasury is pending before any committee of the General Assembly, such committee shall give him reasonable notice of the pendency of such measure, and he shall appear and take such action as he deems to be for the best interests of the state, and he shall represent the public interest in the protection of any gifts, legacies or devises intended for public or charitable purposes. All legal services required by such officers and boards in matters relating to their official duties shall be performed by the Attorney General or under his direction. All writs, summonses or other processes served upon such officers and legislators shall, forthwith, be transmitted by them to the Attorney General. All suits or other proceedings by such officers shall be brought by the Attorney General or under his direction. He shall, when required by either house of the General Assembly or when requested by the president pro tempore of the Senate, the speaker of the House of Representatives, or the majority leader or the minority leader of the Senate or House of Representatives, give his opinion upon questions of law submitted to him by either of said houses or any of said leaders. He shall advise or give his opinion to the head of any executive department or any state board or commission upon any question of law submitted to him. He may procure such assistance as he may require. Whenever a trustee, under the provisions of any charitable trust described in section 45a-514 , is required by statute to give a bond for the performance of his duties as trustee, the Attorney General may cause a petition to be lodged with the probate court of the district in which such trust property is situated, or where any of the trustees reside, for the fixing, accepting and approving of a bond to the state, conditioned for the proper discharge of the duties of such trust, which bond shall be filed in the office of such probate court. The Attorney General shall prepare a topical and chronological cross-index of all legal opinions issued by the office of the Attorney General and shall, from time to time, update the same."

No copy or original of the confidential material described or shown to a person providing oral testimony pursuant to this subsection shall be retained by such person.",

              "(8) (A) For any subpoena issued under this subsection, the person upon whom service of such subpoena was made may file, not later than ten business days after such subpoena is served, a motion to quash such subpoena in the superior court for the judicial district where such person resides or maintains an office or, if such person does not reside or maintain an office in the state, the superior court for the judicial district of Hartford.

The person filing the motion to quash shall be designated as the plaintiff and the Attorney General shall be designated as the defendant. Such motion to quash shall be expeditiously assigned and heard by the court. The date and time of such hearing shall be established by the court. The court shall give notice to the parties of such hearing.",

The court shall, as provided by law, hold a hearing on such motion.",
              "(C) The court may quash or modify any subpoena issued pursuant to this subsection for any just cause, including, but not limited to, the following grounds: (i) The information sought by such subpoena is plainly irrelevant to the Attorney General's investigation; (ii) the information sought by such subpoena is protected by the attorney-client privilege or a statutory or constitutional privilege; (iii) the production of property sought by such subpoena would be unreasonable or oppressive; or (iv) the property sought by such subpoena constitutes attorney work product.",
              "(9) Notwithstanding any provision of this subsection, the Attorney General shall not exercise visitorial powers, including, but not limited to, by issuing a subpoena under this subsection, with respect to a national bank or federal savings association except in a manner consistent with federal law, including, but not limited to, 12 USC 25b(i), as amended from time to time.",

The Attorney General and the commissioner shall make their best efforts to address such material concern and reach an agreement regarding such draft subpoena and shall not unreasonably withhold such agreement.\n\n(C) Notwithstanding subparagraph (B) of this subdivision, for any subpoena issued under this subsection to a bank or out-of-state bank, or an officer, director or employee of such bank or out-of-state bank, the Attorney General shall, not less than ten business days prior to issuing such subpoena, provide a draft of such subpoena to the primary supervisory agency of such bank or out-of-state bank. If, upon reviewing such draft subpoena, the primary supervisory agency identifies a material concern related to an examination, investigation, administrative proceeding or supervisory or regulatory matter within the primary supervisory agency's authority, the primary supervisory agency may, not later than ten business days after receiving such draft subpoena, request an opportunity to meet and confer with the Attorney General. If the primary supervisory agency makes such request, the Attorney General, or the Attorney General's designee, shall make the Attorney General, or the Attorney General's designee, available to meet and confer with the primary supervisory agency not later than ten business days after the primary supervisory agency makes such request.\n\n(D) (i) For any subpoena issued under this subsection to a bank or out-of-state bank, the Attorney General shall request, promptly after any such subpoena is served, to confer in good faith with such bank or out-of-state bank about the matters for examination set forth in such subpoena.\n\n(ii) Except as provided in subparagraph (D)(iii) of this subdivision, when the Attorney General issues a subpoena ad testificandum under this subsection to a bank, out-of-state bank or high-ranking official of a bank or out-of-state bank, such bank, out-of-state bank or high-ranking official may designate one or more officers, directors, managing agents or other individuals who consent to testify on behalf of such bank, out-of-state bank or high-ranking official, and may determine the matters on which each such individual shall testify. The individuals designated by such bank, out-of-state bank or high-ranking official shall testify about information known or reasonably available to such bank, out-of-state bank or high-ranking official.\n\n(iii) If the Attorney General believes in good faith that a high-ranking official of a bank or out-of-state bank that is served with a subpoena under this subsection has unique, direct knowledge about a violation of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, P.L. 111-203, as amended from time to time, and that the information sought by such subpoena could not be obtained through other, less burdensome or intrusive means, such high-ranking official shall testify pursuant to such subpoena.\n\n(iv) In any such subpoena issued under this subsection to a bank or out-of-state bank, the Attorney General shall, in addition to satisfying any applicable requirements of subdivision (2) of this subsection, describe with reasonable particularity the matters for examination pursuant to such subpoena and advise the bank or out-of-state bank of such bank's or out-of-state bank's duty pursuant to this subparagraph to confer with the Attorney General and to designate individuals who shall testify.\n\n(v) The provisions of this subparagraph shall not preclude any other procedure allowed under this subsection.\n\n(2) Any subpoena for documentary material issued under this subsection shall (A) state the nature of the alleged violation, (B) describe the class or classes of documentary material to be produced thereunder with such definiteness and certainty as to be accurately defined, and (C) prescribe a date that would allow a reasonable time to respond. All testimony taken in accordance with subparagraph (A)(ii) of subdivision (1) of this subsection shall be under oath and a written transcript shall be made of the same, a copy of which shall be furnished to the individual appearing, and shall not be available for public disclosure. All written interrogatories shall prescribe a return date that would allow a reasonable time to respond, which responses shall be under oath and not be available for public disclosure. No subpoena issued under this subsection shall require the submission of that portion of any documentary material, testimony or responses to interrogatories that would be privileged or precluded from disclosure if demanded in a grand jury investigation.\n\n(3) Service of subpoenas ad testificandum, subpoenas duces tecum, notices of deposition and written interrogatories, as provided in this subsection, may be made (A) by any proper officer by personal service or service at the usual place of abode, or (B) if service cannot with reasonable diligence be effected under subparagraph (A) of this subdivision, by any proper officer or other person lawfully empowered to make service by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, a duly executed copy thereof addressed to the person to be served at such person's principal place of business in this state or at the place of such person's registered agent in this state, or, if such person has no principal place of business in this state or registered agent in this state, at such person's principal office or such person's usual place of abode.\n\n(4) All documentary material and responses to interrogatories furnished to, and all transcripts of testimony taken by, the Attorney General pursuant to a subpoena issued under this subsection or voluntarily, and all information obtained, collected or prepared in connection with an investigation conducted pursuant to this subsection, including the identity of the person furnishing such documentary material, responses or transcripts, shall be held in the custody of the Attorney General, and shall not be available to the public or be subject to inspection or disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act. Any documentary material furnished to the Attorney General shall be returned to the person that furnished such documentary material, or erased if such documentary material was furnished in electronic format, upon the termination of the Attorney General's investigation or final determination of any action or proceeding commenced thereunder. Except as prohibited by applicable court order, nothing in this subsection shall prohibit a person upon whom a subpoena has been served from disclosing the existence of such subpoena or any information such person furnishes in response to such subpoena.\n\n(5) Notwithstanding the prohibition against public disclosure of documentary material and other information provided in this subsection, any confidential material may be used by the Attorney General in connection with the taking of oral testimony conducted pursuant to this subsection when (A) the Attorney General reasonably determines that it is necessary to disclose such confidential material to a person providing oral testimony in order to adduce evidence of a suspected violation of a provision of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, P.L. 111-203, as amended from time to time, that a state attorney general is authorized by said act to enforce, and (B) the Attorney General believes in good faith that the person providing any such oral testimony (i) is an author or recipient of such confidential material, (ii) has read such confidential material, or (iii) is otherwise aware of the substance of such confidential material. No copy or original of the confidential material described or shown to a person providing oral testimony pursuant to this subsection shall be retained by such person.\n\n(6) The Attorney General may, without waiving any privilege, disclose any confidential material for any appropriate supervisory, governmental, law enforcement or other public purpose, including, but not limited to, a civil action brought pursuant to subsection (b) of this section, and may cooperate with officials of the federal government, the state and other states by, among other things, sharing and disclosing information and evidence obtained pursuant to a subpoena issued under this subsection. No such disclosure or sharing shall be made unless (A) the Attorney General determines that such disclosure or sharing may be made in compliance with any applicable state or federal laws, regulations or rules of civil procedure that govern the right of such officials of the federal government, the state and other states to access such information and evidence, and (B) such disclosure or sharing is made under safeguards designed to prevent further dissemination of such confidential material. In any proceeding before a court, the court may issue a protective order in appropriate circumstances to protect the confidentiality of any such confidential material and order that any such confidential material on file with the court or filed in connection with the court proceeding be sealed, and that the public be excluded from any portion of the proceeding at which any such confidential material is disclosed.\n\n(7) In the event any person refuses to comply with, or otherwise fails to comply with, a subpoena served in accordance with the provisions of this subsection, the Attorney General may apply to the superior court for the judicial district where such person resides or maintains an office or, if such person does not reside or maintain an office in the state, the superior court for the judicial district of Hartford for an order (A) compelling such person to comply with such subpoena, which court may, upon notice to such person, issue such order, which shall be served upon such person, and (B) requiring such person to pay to the state a civil penalty in an amount not to exceed ten thousand dollars, which court may, after notice to such person and a hearing thereon, issue such order.\n\n(8) (A) For any subpoena issued under this subsection, the person upon whom service of such subpoena was made may file, not later than ten business days after such subpoena is served, a motion to quash such subpoena in the superior court for the judicial district where such person resides or maintains an office or, if such person does not reside or maintain an office in the state, the superior court for the judicial district of Hartford. Notwithstanding any provision of the general statutes, no fees or costs shall be assessed for the filing of such motion. The person filing the motion to quash shall be designated as the plaintiff and the Attorney General shall be designated as the defendant. Such motion to quash shall be expeditiously assigned and heard by the court. The date and time of such hearing shall be established by the court. The court shall give notice to the parties of such hearing.\n\n(B) Upon the filing of such motion to quash, any party to the proceeding regarding such motion to quash may, as provided by law, file a motion to seal or limit the disclosure of files, affidavits, documents or other materials on file or lodged with the court or in connection with a court proceeding. The court shall, as provided by law, hold a hearing on such motion.\n\n(C) The court may quash or modify any subpoena issued pursuant to this subsection for any just cause, including, but not limited to, the following grounds: (i) The information sought by such subpoena is plainly irrelevant to the Attorney General's investigation; (ii) the information sought by such subpoena is protected by the attorney-client privilege or a statutory or constitutional privilege; (iii) the production of property sought by such subpoena would be unreasonable or oppressive; or (iv) the property sought by such subpoena constitutes attorney work product.\n\n(9) Notwithstanding any provision of this subsection, the Attorney General shall not exercise visitorial powers, including, but not limited to, by issuing a subpoena under this subsection, with respect to a national bank or federal savings association except in a manner consistent with federal law, including, but not limited to, 12 USC 25b(i), as amended from time to time.\n\n(d) Nothing in this section shall be construed to limit the authority of the commissioner to enforce the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, P.L. 111-203, as amended from time to time, or any other state or federal law or regulation."
