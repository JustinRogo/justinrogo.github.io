The complaint shall identify the person on which or the property to, in or on which the tracking device is to be installed, and, if known, the owner of such property.\n\n(d) A warrant may issue only on affidavit sworn to by the complainant or complainants before the judge or judge trial referee, either in person or electronically with simultaneous sight and sound, and establishing the grounds for issuing the warrant, which affidavit shall be part of the arrest file. If the judge or judge trial referee is satisfied that grounds for the application exist or that there is probable cause to believe that grounds for the application exist, the judge or judge trial referee shall issue a warrant identifying the property and naming or describing the person, place or thing to be searched or authorizing the installation and use of a tracking device and identifying the person on which or the property to, in or on which the tracking device is to be installed. The warrant shall be directed to any police officer of a regularly organized police department or any state police officer, to an inspector in the Division of Criminal Justice, to a conservation officer, special conservation officer or patrolman acting pursuant to section 26-6 or to a sworn motor vehicle inspector acting under the authority of section 14-8 . Except for a warrant for the installation and use of a tracking device, the warrant shall state the date and time of its issuance and the grounds or probable cause for its issuance and shall command the officer to search within a reasonable time the person, place or thing named, for the property specified. A warrant for the installation and use of a tracking device shall state the date and time of its issuance and the grounds or probable cause for its issuance and shall command the officer to complete the installation of the device within a specified period not later than ten days after the date of its issuance and authorize the installation and use of the tracking device, including the collection of data through such tracking device, for a reasonable period of time not to exceed thirty days from the date the tracking device is installed. Upon request and a showing of good cause, a judge or judge trial referee may authorize the use of the tracking device for an additional period of thirty days.\n\n(e) No police officer of a regularly organized police department or any state police officer, an inspector in the Division of Criminal Justice, a conservation officer, special conservation officer or patrolman acting pursuant to section 26-6 or a sworn motor vehicle inspector acting under the authority of section 14-8 , shall seek, execute or participate in the execution of a no-knock warrant. A search warrant authorized under this section shall require that an officer provide notice of such officer's identity, authority and purpose prior to entering the place to be searched for the execution of such search warrant. Prior to undertaking any search or seizure pursuant to the search warrant, the executing officer shall read and give a copy of the search warrant to the person to be searched or the owner of the place to be searched or, if the owner is not present, to any occupant of the place to be searched. If the place to be searched is unoccupied, the executing officer shall leave a copy of the search warrant suitably affixed to the place to be searched. For purposes of this subsection, “no-knock warrant” means a warrant authorizing police officers to enter certain premises without first knocking and announcing their presence or purpose prior to entering the place to be searched.\n\n(f) A judge or judge trial referee may issue a warrant pursuant to this section for records or data that are in the actual or constructive possession of a foreign corporation or business entity that transacts business in this state, including, but not limited to, a foreign corporation or business entity that provides electronic communication services or remote computing services to the public. Such a warrant may be served on an authorized representative of the foreign corporation or business entity by hand, mail, commercial delivery, facsimile or electronic transmission, provided proof of delivery can be established. When properly served with a warrant issued pursuant to this section, the foreign corporation or business entity shall provide to the applicant all records or data sought by the warrant within fourteen business days of being served with the warrant, unless the judge or judge trial referee determines that a shorter or longer period of time is necessary or appropriate.\n\n(g) The inadvertent failure of the issuing judge or judge trial referee to state on the warrant the time of its issuance shall not in and of itself invalidate the warrant.\n\nSee Sec. 54-154 re taxing of expenses in search and seizure cases."

The court shall deny the petition and return the property to the owner if the criminal proceeding does not result in (1) a plea of guilty or nolo contendere to any offense charged in the same criminal information, (2) a guilty verdict after trial to a forfeiture-eligible offense for which the property was possessed, controlled, designed or intended for use, or which was or had been used as a means of committing such offense, or which constitutes the proceeds of the commission of such offense, or (3) a dismissal resulting from the completion of a pretrial diversionary program.\n\n(c) If the court finds the allegations made in such petition to be true and that the property has been possessed, controlled or designed for use, or is or has been or is intended to be used, with intent to violate or in violation of any of the criminal laws of this state, or constitutes the proceeds of a violation of any of the criminal laws of this state, except a violation of section 21a-267 , 21a-277 , 21a-278 , 21a-278b or 21a-279 , and that a plea of guilty or nolo contendere to such offense or another charge in the same criminal information, or a guilty verdict after trial for such forfeiture-eligible offense, or a dismissal resulting from the completion of a pretrial diversionary program has been entered, the court shall render judgment that such property is a nuisance and order the property to be destroyed or disposed of to a charitable or educational institution or to a governmental agency or institution, except that if any such property is subject to a bona fide mortgage, assignment of lease or rent, lien or security interest, such property shall not be so destroyed or disposed of in violation of the rights of the holder of such mortgage, assignment of lease or rent, lien or security interest.\n\n(d) (1) When the condemned property is money (A) on and after October 1, 2014, and prior to July 1, 2016, the court shall order that such money be distributed as follows: (i) Seventy per cent shall be allocated to the law enforcement agency, including the Department of Emergency Services and Public Protection and local police departments, responsible for investigating the criminal violation and seizing the money, and such local police departments shall use such money for the detection, investigation, apprehension and prosecution of persons for the violation of criminal laws, and any money allocated to the Department of Emergency Services and Public Protection shall be deposited in the General Fund; (ii) twenty per cent shall be deposited in the Criminal Injuries Compensation Fund established in section 54-215 ; and (iii) ten per cent shall be allocated to the Division of Criminal Justice and deposited in the General Fund; and (B) on and after July 1, 2016, such money shall be deposited in the General Fund.\n\n(2) When the condemned property is a valuable prize, which is subject to a bona fide mortgage, assignment of lease or rent, lien or security interest, such property shall remain subject to such mortgage, assignment of lease or rent, lien or security interest.\n\n(e) When any property or valuable prize has been declared a nuisance and condemned under this section, the court may also order that such property be sold in accordance with procedures approved by the Commissioner of Administrative Services. Proceeds of such sale shall first be allocated toward the balance of any mortgage, assignment of lease or rent, lien or security interest, and the remaining proceeds of such sale, if any, shall be allocated in accordance with subparagraphs (A) to (C), inclusive, of subdivision (1) of subsection (d) of this section. In any criminal prosecution, secondary evidence of property condemned and destroyed pursuant to this section shall be admissible against the defendant to the same extent as such evidence would have been admissible had the property not been condemned and destroyed.\n\n(f) If the court finds the allegations not to be true, irrespective of the findings in the criminal proceeding, or that the property has not been kept with intent to violate or in violation of the criminal laws of this state, or that the property does not constitute the proceeds of a violation of the criminal laws of this state, or that the property is the property of a person who is not a defendant, the court shall order the property returned to the owner forthwith and the party in possession of such property pending such determination shall be responsible and personally liable for such property from the time of seizure and shall immediately comply with such order.\n\n(g) Failure of the state to proceed against such property in accordance with the provisions of this section shall not prevent the use of such property as evidence in any criminal trial."

              "(a) As used in this section, sections 53-278c and 54-36c : (1) “Contraband” means any property, the possession of which is prohibited by any provision of the general statutes; (2) “stolen property” shall include, but not be limited to, cash or the proceeds from the sale of such property obtained by theft or other illegal means; (3) “owner” means a person or persons entitled to seized property as a matter of law or fact.",
              "(b) (1) Whenever property is seized in connection with a criminal arrest or seized pursuant to a search warrant without an arrest, the law enforcement agency seizing such property shall file, on forms provided for this purpose by the Office of the Chief Court Administrator, an inventory of the property seized. The inventory, together with the uniform arrest report, in the case of an arrest, shall be filed with the clerk of the court for the geographical area in which the criminal offense is alleged to have been committed; except, when the property is stolen property and, in the opinion of the law enforcement officer, does not exceed one thousand dollars in value, or when an attempt was made to steal the property but the property at all times remained on the premises in a sealed container, the filing of an inventory shall not be required and such property may be returned to the owner. In the case of property seized in connection with a search warrant without an arrest, the inventory shall be attached to the warrant and shall be filed with the clerk of the court for the geographical area in which the search warrant was issued. If any criminal proceeding is transferred to another court location, then the clerk with whom the inventory is filed shall transfer such inventory to the clerk of the court location to which such action is transferred.",
              "(2) If the seized property is stolen property, within ten days of the seizure, the law enforcement agency seizing the property shall notify the owner of the property if known, or, if the owner of the property is unknown at the time of seizure, such agency shall within ten days of any subsequent ascertainment of the owner notify such owner, and, on a form prescribed by the Office of the Chief Court Administrator, advise the owner of such owner's rights concerning the property and the location of the property. Such written notice shall include a request form for the return of the property. The owner may request the return of the property by filing such request form with such law enforcement agency, and upon receipt of such request, the law enforcement agency shall forward it to the clerk of the court for the geographical area in which the criminal offense is alleged to have been committed. The clerk of the court shall notify the defendant or defendants of the request to return the property. The court shall order the return of the property within thirty days of the date of filing such return request by the owner, except that for good cause shown, the court may order retention of the property for a period to be determined by the court. Any secondary evidence of the identity, description or value of such property shall be admissible in evidence against such defendant in the trial of such case. The fact that the evidence is secondary in nature may be shown to affect the weight of such evidence, but not to affect its admissibility. If the stolen property is a motor vehicle, a photograph of the motor vehicle and a sworn affidavit attesting to the vehicle identification number of such motor vehicle shall be sufficient evidence of the identity of the motor vehicle. For the purposes of this subdivision, “motor vehicle” means a passenger or commercial motor vehicle or a motorcycle, as defined in section 14-1 , and includes construction equipment, agricultural tractors and farm implements.",
              "(3) (A) If the seized property is currency and is stolen property, the law enforcement agency seizing the currency shall follow the procedures set forth in subdivision (2) of this subsection.",

Such defendant or person may, not later than thirty days after receiving such notice, request a hearing before the Superior Court. The court may, after any such hearing, order that the law enforcement agency, after taking reasonable measures to preserve the evidentiary value of the currency, deposit the currency in a deposit account in the name of the law enforcement agency as custodian for evidentiary funds at a financial institution in this state or order, for good cause shown, that the currency be retained for a period to be determined by the court. If such defendant or person does not request a hearing, the law enforcement agency may, after taking reasonable measures to preserve the evidentiary value of the currency, deposit the currency in a deposit account in the name of the law enforcement agency as custodian for evidentiary funds at a financial institution in this state.",

No funds may be withdrawn from such deposit account except pursuant to a court order directed to the financial institution. Any withdrawal of funds from such deposit account shall be in the form of a check issued by the financial institution to the law enforcement agency or to such other payee as the court may order. Nothing in this subdivision shall prohibit a financial institution from charging a fee for the maintenance and administration of such deposit account and for the review of the court order.",

The fact that the evidence is secondary in nature may be shown to affect the weight of such evidence, but not to affect its admissibility.",

              "(d) When the court orders the return of the seized property to the owner, the order shall provide that if the seized property is not claimed by the owner within six months, the property shall be destroyed or be given to a charitable or educational institution or to a governmental agency or institution, except that (1) if such property is money it shall be remitted to the state and shall be deposited in the General Fund or (2) if such property is a valuable prize it shall be disposed of by public auction or private sale in which case the proceeds shall become the property of the state and shall be deposited in the General Fund; provided any person who has a bona fide mortgage, assignment of lease or rent, lien or security interest in such property shall have the same right to the proceeds as such person had in the property prior to the sale.",
              "(e) If such seized property is adjudicated a nuisance or if the court finds that such property shall be forfeited or is contraband other than a controlled drug or controlled substance as defined in section 21a-240 , or drug paraphernalia as defined in subdivision (20) of section 21a-240 , the court shall order that such property be destroyed or be given to a charitable or educational institution or to a governmental agency or institution, except that (1) if such property is money, the court shall order that it be remitted to the state and be deposited in the General Fund, or (2) if such property is a valuable prize, the court shall order that it be disposed of by public auction or private sale in which case the proceeds shall become the property of the state and shall be deposited in the General Fund; provided any person who has a bona fide mortgage, assignment of lease or rent, lien or security interest in such property shall have the same right to the proceeds as such person had in the property prior to sale.",
              "(f) If the court finds that such seized property is fireworks as defined in section 29-356 , the court shall order the forfeiture and destruction of such property. Any secondary evidence of the identity, description or value of such property shall be admissible in evidence against the defendant in the trial of the case. A photograph of the fireworks and a sworn affidavit describing such fireworks shall be sufficient evidence of the identity of the fireworks. The fact that the evidence is secondary in nature may be shown to affect the weight of such evidence, but not to affect its admissibility.",
              "(g) If the court finds that such seized property is a controlled drug or controlled substance as defined in section 21a-240 , or drug paraphernalia as defined in subdivision (20) of section 21a-240 , the court shall order the forfeiture and destruction of such property or order it delivered to the Commissioner of Consumer Protection pursuant to section 54-36g .",
              "(h) Any order made under the provisions of subsections (b), (c), (d), (e), (f) and (g) of this section or section 54-33f or 54-33g , shall upon notification from the clerk, be complied with by the person or department having custody or possession of such property.",
              "(i) A return of compliance with the court order, on a form prescribed by the Office of the Chief Court Administrator, shall be filed with the clerk of the court by the person or department to whom notice is sent in accordance with the provisions of subsection (h) of this section. If the court ordered the seized property returned to the owner within six months upon proper claim therefor, the return of the compliance shall be filed within seventy-two hours of the return of the property to the owner. If the owner does not claim the property within six months, then the return of compliance shall be filed within seventy-two hours of compliance with the order of the court pursuant to subsection (d) of this section. Failure to comply with the court order within ninety days following expiration of the period within which the owner of the property may claim the property shall constitute criminal contempt. If the court renders an order concerning the disposition of the property other than an order to return the property to the owner, the return of compliance shall be filed with the clerk within seventy-two hours of compliance with the court order. Failure to comply with the court order within ninety days of receipt of such order shall constitute criminal contempt. Failure to file a return of compliance as set forth in this subsection shall constitute criminal contempt. Anyone convicted of criminal contempt may be punished by a fine of not more than one hundred dollars. Each failure to comply with a court order and each failure to file a return of compliance within the required period shall constitute a separate criminal contempt."

Any secondary evidence of the identity, description or value of such property shall be admissible in evidence against the defendant in the trial of the case. A photograph of the fireworks and a sworn affidavit describing such fireworks shall be sufficient evidence of the identity of the fireworks. The fact that the evidence is secondary in nature may be shown to affect the weight of such evidence, but not to affect its admissibility.\n\n(g) If the court finds that such seized property is a controlled drug or controlled substance as defined in section 21a-240 , or drug paraphernalia as defined in subdivision (20) of section 21a-240 , the court shall order the forfeiture and destruction of such property or order it delivered to the Commissioner of Consumer Protection pursuant to section 54-36g .\n\n(h) Any order made under the provisions of subsections (b), (c), (d), (e), (f) and (g) of this section or section 54-33f or 54-33g , shall upon notification from the clerk, be complied with by the person or department having custody or possession of such property.\n\n(i) A return of compliance with the court order, on a form prescribed by the Office of the Chief Court Administrator, shall be filed with the clerk of the court by the person or department to whom notice is sent in accordance with the provisions of subsection (h) of this section. If the court ordered the seized property returned to the owner within six months upon proper claim therefor, the return of the compliance shall be filed within seventy-two hours of the return of the property to the owner. If the owner does not claim the property within six months, then the return of compliance shall be filed within seventy-two hours of compliance with the order of the court pursuant to subsection (d) of this section. Failure to comply with the court order within ninety days following expiration of the period within which the owner of the property may claim the property shall constitute criminal contempt. If the court renders an order concerning the disposition of the property other than an order to return the property to the owner, the return of compliance shall be filed with the clerk within seventy-two hours of compliance with the court order. Failure to comply with the court order within ninety days of receipt of such order shall constitute criminal contempt. Failure to file a return of compliance as set forth in this subsection shall constitute criminal contempt. Anyone convicted of criminal contempt may be punished by a fine of not more than one hundred dollars. Each failure to comply with a court order and each failure to file a return of compliance within the required period shall constitute a separate criminal contempt."

If the examiners determine that there is not a substantial probability that the defendant, if provided with a course of treatment, will regain competency within the maximum period of any placement order under this section, the examiners shall then determine whether the defendant appears to be eligible for civil commitment to a hospital for psychiatric disabilities pursuant to subsection (m) of this section and make a recommendation to the court regarding the appropriateness of such civil commitment. The court may authorize a physician specializing in psychiatry, a clinical psychologist, a clinical social worker licensed pursuant to chapter 383b or a psychiatric nurse clinical specialist holding a master's degree in nursing selected by the defendant to observe the examination. Counsel for the defendant may observe the examination.

              "(2) In determining the least restrictive placement appropriate and available to restore competency, the court shall consider the following factors: (A) The nature and circumstances of the alleged crime; (B) such defendant's record of criminal convictions; (C) such defendant's record of appearance in court; (D) such defendant's family and community ties; (E) such defendant's willingness and ability to engage with treatment ordered under this section; (F) whether such defendant's use of substances would interfere with such defendant's ability to be successful in such placement; (G) any psychiatric symptoms experienced by such defendant and the nature and severity of the symptoms; and (H) any other relevant factors specific to the defendant and such defendant's circumstances.",
              "(3) If the defendant is not charged with a felony, the court shall presume that outpatient treatment is the least restrictive placement appropriate and available to restore competency, unless the court has good cause to find otherwise based on review of the factors in subdivision (2) of this subsection. If outpatient treatment is the least restrictive placement for a defendant who has not yet been released from a correctional facility, the court shall consider whether the availability of such treatment is a sufficient basis on which to release the defendant on a promise to appear, conditions of release, cash bail or bond. If the court determines that the defendant may not be so released, the court shall order treatment of the defendant on an inpatient basis at a mental health facility or facility for persons with intellectual disability. Not later than twenty-four hours after the court orders placement of the defendant for treatment for the purpose of rendering the defendant competent, the examiners shall transmit information obtained about the defendant during the course of an examination pursuant to subsection (d) of this section to the health care provider named in the court's order.",
              "(j) Progress reports re treatment. The person in charge of the treatment facility, or such person's designee, or the Commissioner of Mental Health and Addiction Services with respect to any defendant who is in the custody of the Commissioner of Correction pursuant to subsection (p) of this section, shall submit a written progress report to the court (1) at least seven days prior to the date of any hearing on the issue of the defendant's competency; (2) whenever he or she believes that the defendant has attained competency; (3) whenever he or she believes that there is not a substantial probability that the defendant will attain competency within the period covered by the placement order; (4) whenever, within the first one hundred twenty days of the period covered by the placement order, he or she believes that the defendant would be eligible for civil commitment pursuant to subdivision (2) of subsection (h) of this section; or (5) whenever he or she believes that the defendant is still not competent but has improved sufficiently such that continued inpatient commitment is no longer the least restrictive placement appropriate and available to restore competency. The progress report shall contain: (A) The clinical findings of the person submitting the report and the facts on which the findings are based; (B) the opinion of the person submitting the report as to whether the defendant has attained competency or as to whether the defendant is making progress, under treatment, toward attaining competency within the period covered by the placement order; (C) the opinion of the person submitting the report as to whether the defendant appears to be eligible for civil commitment to a hospital for psychiatric disabilities pursuant to subsection (m) of this section and the appropriateness of such civil commitment, if there is not a substantial probability that the defendant will attain competency within the period covered by the placement order; and (D) any other information concerning the defendant requested by the court, including, but not limited to, the method of treatment or the type, dosage and effect of any medication the defendant is receiving.

              "(k) Reconsideration of competency. Hearing. Involuntary medication. Appointment and duties of health care guardian. (1) Whenever any placement order for treatment is rendered or continued, the court shall set a date for a hearing, to be held within ninety days, for reconsideration of the issue of the defendant's competency. Whenever the court (A) receives a report pursuant to subsection (j) of this section which indicates that (i) the defendant has attained competency, (ii) the defendant will not attain competency within the remainder of the period covered by the placement order, (iii) the defendant will not attain competency within the remainder of the period covered by the placement order absent administration of psychiatric medication for which the defendant is unwilling or unable to provide consent, (iv) the defendant would be eligible for civil commitment pursuant to subdivision (2) of subsection (h) of this section, or (v) the defendant is still not competent but has improved sufficiently such that continued inpatient commitment is no longer the least restrictive placement appropriate and available to restore competency, or (B) receives a report pursuant to subparagraph (A)(iii) of subdivision (2) of subsection (h) of this section which indicates that (i) the application for civil commitment of the defendant has been denied or has not been pursued by the Commissioner of Mental Health and Addiction Services, or (ii) the defendant is unwilling or unable to comply with a treatment plan despite reasonable efforts of the treatment facility to encourage the defendant's compliance, the court shall set the matter for a hearing not later than ten days after the report is received. The hearing may be waived by the defendant only if the report indicates that the defendant is competent. With respect to a defendant who is in the custody of the Commissioner of Correction pursuant to subsection (p) of this section, the Commissioner of Mental Health and Addiction Services shall retain responsibility for providing testimony at any hearing under this subsection. The court shall determine whether the defendant is competent or is making progress toward attaining competency within the period covered by the placement order. If the court finds that the defendant is competent, the defendant shall be returned to the custody of the Commissioner of Correction or released, if the defendant has met the conditions for release, and the court shall continue with the criminal proceedings. If the court finds that the defendant is still not competent but that the defendant is making progress toward attaining competency, the court may continue or modify the placement order. If the court finds that the defendant is still not competent but that the defendant is making progress toward attaining competency and inpatient placement is no longer the least restrictive placement appropriate and available to restore competency, the court shall consider whether the availability of such less restrictive placement is a sufficient basis on which to release the defendant on a promise to appear, conditions of release, cash bail or bond and may order continued treatment to restore competency on an outpatient basis. If the court finds that the defendant is still not competent and will not attain competency within the remainder of the period covered by the placement order absent administration of psychiatric medication for which the defendant is unwilling or unable to provide consent, the court shall proceed as provided in subdivisions (2), (3) and (4) of this subsection. If the court finds that the defendant is eligible for civil commitment, the court may order placement of the defendant at a treatment facility pending civil commitment proceedings pursuant to subdivision (2) of subsection (h) of this section.",
              "(2) If the court finds that the defendant will not attain competency within the remainder of the period covered by the placement order absent administration of psychiatric medication for which the defendant is unwilling or unable to provide consent, and after any hearing held pursuant to subdivision (3) of this subsection, the court may order the involuntary medication of the defendant if the court finds by clear and convincing evidence that: (A) To a reasonable degree of medical certainty, involuntary medication of the defendant will render the defendant competent to stand trial, (B) an adjudication of guilt or innocence cannot be had using less intrusive means, (C) the proposed treatment plan is narrowly tailored to minimize intrusion on the defendant's liberty and privacy interests, (D) the proposed drug regimen will not cause an unnecessary risk to the defendant's health, and (E) the seriousness of the alleged crime is such that the criminal law enforcement interest of the state in fairly and accurately determining the defendant's guilt or innocence overrides the defendant's interest in self-determination.",
              "(3) (A) If the court finds that the defendant is unwilling or unable to provide consent for the administration of psychiatric medication, and prior to deciding whether to order the involuntary medication of the defendant under subdivision (2) of this subsection, the court shall appoint a health care guardian who shall be a licensed health care provider with specialized training in the treatment of persons with psychiatric disabilities to represent the health care interests of the defendant before the court. Notwithstanding the provisions of section 52-146e , such health care guardian shall have access to the psychiatric records of the defendant. Such health care guardian shall file a report with the court not later than thirty days after his or her appointment. The report shall set forth such health care guardian's findings and recommendations concerning the administration of psychiatric medication to the defendant, including the risks and benefits of such medication, the likelihood and seriousness of any adverse side effects and the prognosis with and without such medication. The court shall hold a hearing on the matter not later than ten days after receipt of such health care guardian's report and shall, in deciding whether to order the involuntary medication of the defendant, take into account such health care guardian's opinion concerning the health care interests of the defendant.",
              "(B) The court, in anticipation of considering continued involuntary medication of the defendant under subdivision (4) of this subsection, shall order the health care guardian to file a supplemental report updating the findings and recommendations contained in the health care guardian's report filed under subparagraph (A) of this subdivision.",
              "(4) If, after the defendant has been found to have attained competency by means of involuntary medication ordered under subdivision (2) of this subsection, the court determines by clear and convincing evidence that the defendant will not remain competent absent the continued administration of psychiatric medication for which the defendant is unable to provide consent, and after any hearing held pursuant to subdivision (3) of this subsection and consideration of the supplemental report of the health care guardian, the court may order continued involuntary medication of the defendant if the court finds by clear and convincing evidence that: (A) To a reasonable degree of medical certainty, continued involuntary medication of the defendant will maintain the defendant's competency to stand trial, (B) an adjudication of guilt or innocence cannot be had using less intrusive means, (C) the proposed treatment plan is narrowly tailored to minimize intrusion on the defendant's liberty and privacy interests, (D) the proposed drug regimen will not cause an unnecessary risk to the defendant's health, and (E) the seriousness of the alleged crime is such that the criminal law enforcement interest of the state in fairly and accurately determining the defendant's guilt or innocence overrides the defendant's interest in self-determination. Continued involuntary medication ordered under this subdivision may be administered to the defendant while the criminal charges against the defendant are pending and the defendant is in the custody of the Commissioner of Correction or the Commissioner of Mental Health and Addiction Services. An order for continued involuntary medication of the defendant under this subdivision shall be reviewed by the court every one hundred eighty days while such order remains in effect. The court shall order the health care guardian to file a supplemental report for each such review. After any hearing held pursuant to subdivision (3) of this subsection and consideration of the supplemental report of the health care guardian, the court may continue such order if the court finds, by clear and convincing evidence, that the criteria enumerated in subparagraphs (A) to (E), inclusive, of this subdivision are met.",
              "(5) The state shall hold harmless and indemnify any health care guardian appointed by the court pursuant to subdivision (3) of this subsection from financial loss and expense arising out of any claim, demand, suit or judgment by reason of such health care guardian's alleged negligence or alleged deprivation of any person's civil rights or other act or omission resulting in damage or injury, provided the health care guardian is found to have been acting in the discharge of his or her duties pursuant to said subdivision and such act or omission is found not to have been wanton, reckless or malicious. The provisions of subsections (b), (c) and (d) of section 5-141d shall apply to such health care guardian. The provisions of chapter 53 shall not apply to a claim against such health care guardian.",
              "(l) Failure of defendant to return to treatment facility in accordance with terms and conditions of release. If a defendant who has been ordered placed for treatment on an inpatient basis at a mental health facility or a facility for persons with intellectual disability is released from such facility on a furlough or for work, therapy or any other reason and fails to return to the facility in accordance with the terms and conditions of the defendant's release, the person in charge of the facility, or such person's designee, shall, within twenty-four hours of the defendant's failure to return, report such failure to the prosecuting authority for the court location which ordered the placement of the defendant. Upon receipt of such a report, the prosecuting authority shall, within available resources, make reasonable efforts to notify any victim or victims of the crime for which the defendant is charged of such defendant's failure to return to the facility. No civil liability shall be incurred by the state or the prosecuting authority for failure to notify any victim or victims in accordance with this subsection. The failure of a defendant to return to the facility in which the defendant has been placed may constitute sufficient cause for the defendant's rearrest upon order by the court.",
              "(m) Release or placement of defendant who will not attain competency. Report to court prior to release from placement. (1) If at any time the court determines that there is not a substantial probability that the defendant will attain competency within the period of treatment allowed by this section, or if at the end of such period the court finds that the defendant is still not competent, the court shall consider any recommendation made by the examiners pursuant to subsection (d) of this section and any opinion submitted by the treatment facility pursuant to subparagraph (C) of subsection (j) of this section regarding eligibility for, and the appropriateness of, civil commitment to a hospital for psychiatric disabilities and shall either release the defendant from custody or order the defendant placed in the custody of the Commissioner of Mental Health and Addiction Services, the Commissioner of Children and Families or the Commissioner of Developmental Services. If the court orders the defendant placed in the custody of the Commissioner of Children and Families or the Commissioner of Developmental Services, the commissioner given custody, or the commissioner's designee, shall then apply for civil commitment in accordance with sections 17a-75 to 17a-83 , inclusive, or 17a-270 to 17a-282 , inclusive.

If the court orders the defendant placed in the custody of the Commissioner of Mental Health and Addiction Services and orders the commissioner to apply for civil commitment pursuant to this subsection, the court may order the commissioner to give the court notice when the defendant is released from the commissioner's custody if such release is prior to the expiration of the time within which the defendant may be prosecuted for the crime with which the defendant is charged, provided such order indicates when such time expires. If the court orders the defendant placed in the custody of the Commissioner of Developmental Services for purposes of commitment under any provision of sections 17a-270 to 17a-282 , inclusive, the court may order the Commissioner of Developmental Services to give the court notice when the defendant's commitment is terminated if such termination is prior to the expiration of the time within which the defendant may be prosecuted for the crime with which the defendant is charged, provided such order indicates when such time expires.",
              "(2) The court shall hear arguments as to whether the defendant should be released or should be placed in the custody of the Commissioner of Mental Health and Addiction Services, the Commissioner of Children and Families or the Commissioner of Developmental Services.",
              "(3) If the court orders the release of a defendant charged with the commission of a crime that resulted in the death or serious physical injury, as defined in section 53a-3 , of another person, or with a violation of section 53a-70b of the general statutes, revision of 1958, revised to January 1, 2019, or subdivision (2) of subsection (a) of section 53-21 , subdivision (2) of subsection (a) of section 53a-60 or section 53a-60a , 53a-70 , 53a-70a , 53a-71 , 53a-72a or 53a-72b , or orders the placement of such defendant in the custody of the Commissioner of Mental Health and Addiction Services or the Commissioner of Developmental Services, the court may, on its own motion or on motion of the prosecuting authority, order, as a condition of such release or placement, periodic examinations of the defendant as to the defendant's competency at intervals of not less than six months. If, at any time after the initial periodic examination, the court finds again, based upon an examiner's recommendation, that there is a substantial probability that the defendant, if provided with a course of treatment, will never regain competency, then any subsequent periodic examination of the defendant as to the defendant's competency shall be at intervals of not less than eighteen months. Such an examination shall be conducted in accordance with subsection (d) of this section. Periodic examinations ordered by the court under this subsection shall continue until the court finds that the defendant has attained competency or until the time within which the defendant may be prosecuted for the crime with which the defendant is charged, as provided in section 54-193 , has expired, whichever occurs first.",
              "(4) Upon receipt of the written report as provided in subsection (d) of this section, the court shall, upon the request of either party filed not later than thirty days after the court receives such report, conduct a hearing as provided in subsection (e) of this section.

Notwithstanding the record erasure provisions of section 54-142a , police and court records and records of any state's attorney pertaining to a charge which is nolled or dismissed without prejudice while the defendant is not competent shall not be erased until the time for the prosecution of the defendant expires under section 54-193 . A defendant who is not civilly committed as a result of an application made by the Commissioner of Mental Health and Addiction Services, the Commissioner of Children and Families or the Commissioner of Developmental Services pursuant to this section shall be released. A defendant who is civilly committed pursuant to such an application shall be treated in the same manner as any other civilly committed person.",

For the purposes of this section, a defendant is not competent if the defendant is unable to understand the proceedings against him or her or to assist in his or her own defense.\n\n(b) Presumption of competency. A defendant is presumed to be competent. The burden of proving that the defendant is not competent by a preponderance of the evidence and the burden of going forward with the evidence are on the party raising the issue. The burden of going forward with the evidence shall be on the state if the court raises the issue. The court may call its own witnesses and conduct its own inquiry.\n\n(c) Request for examination. If, at any time during a criminal proceeding, it appears that the defendant is not competent, counsel for the defendant or for the state, or the court, on its own motion, may request an examination to determine the defendant's competency.\n\n(d) Examination of defendant. Report. If the court finds that the request for an examination is justified and that, in accordance with procedures established by the judges of the Superior Court, there is probable cause to believe that the defendant has committed the crime for which the defendant is charged, the court shall order an examination of the defendant as to his or her competency. The court may (1) appoint one or more physicians specializing in psychiatry to examine the defendant, or (2) order the Commissioner of Mental Health and Addiction Services to conduct the examination either (A) by a clinical team consisting of a physician specializing in psychiatry, a clinical psychologist and one of the following: A clinical social worker licensed pursuant to chapter 383b or a psychiatric nurse clinical specialist holding a master's degree in nursing, or (B) by one or more physicians specializing in psychiatry, except that no employee of the Department of Mental Health and Addiction Services who has served as a member of a clinical team in the course of such employment for at least five years prior to October 1, 1995, shall be precluded from being appointed as a member of a clinical team. If the Commissioner of Mental Health and Addiction Services is ordered to conduct the examination, the commissioner shall select the members of the clinical team or the physician or physicians. When performing an examination under this section, the examiners shall have access to information on treatment dates and locations in the defendant's treatment history contained in the Department of Mental Health and Addiction Services' database of treatment episodes for the purpose of requesting a release of treatment information from the defendant. If the examiners determine that the defendant is not competent, the examiners shall then determine whether there is a substantial probability that the defendant, if provided with a course of treatment, will regain competency within the maximum period of any placement order under this section. If the examiners determine that there is a substantial probability that the defendant, if provided with a course of treatment, will regain competency within the maximum period of any placement order under this section, the examiners shall then determine whether the defendant appears to be eligible for civil commitment, with monitoring by the Court Support Services Division, pursuant to subdivision (2) of subsection (h) of this section. If the examiners determine that there is not a substantial probability that the defendant, if provided with a course of treatment, will regain competency within the maximum period of any placement order under this section, the examiners shall then determine whether the defendant appears to be eligible for civil commitment to a hospital for psychiatric disabilities pursuant to subsection (m) of this section and make a recommendation to the court regarding the appropriateness of such civil commitment. The court may authorize a physician specializing in psychiatry, a clinical psychologist, a clinical social worker licensed pursuant to chapter 383b or a psychiatric nurse clinical specialist holding a master's degree in nursing selected by the defendant to observe the examination. Counsel for the defendant may observe the examination. The examination shall be completed within fifteen business days from the date it was ordered and the examiners shall prepare and sign, without notarization, a written report and file such report with the court within twenty-one business days of the date of the order. On receipt of the written report, the clerk of the court shall cause copies to be delivered immediately to the state's attorney and to counsel for the defendant.\n\n(e) Hearing. Evidence. The court shall hold a hearing as to the competency of the defendant not later than ten days after the court receives the written report. Any evidence regarding the defendant's competency, including the written report, may be introduced at the hearing by either the defendant or the state, except that no treatment information contained in the Department of Mental Health and Addiction Services' database of treatment episodes may be included in the written report or introduced at the hearing unless the defendant released the treatment information pursuant to subsection (d) of this section. If the written report is introduced, at least one of the examiners shall be present to testify as to the determinations in the report, unless the examiner's presence is waived by the defendant and the state. Any member of the clinical team shall be considered competent to testify as to the team's determinations. A defendant and the defendant's counsel may waive the court hearing only if the examiners, in the written report, determine without qualification that the defendant is competent. Nothing in this subsection shall limit any other release or use of information from said database permitted by law.\n\n(f) Court finding of competency or incompetency. If the court, after the hearing, finds that the defendant is competent, the court shall continue with the criminal proceedings. If the court finds that the defendant is not competent, the court shall also find whether there is a substantial probability that the defendant, if provided with a course of treatment, will regain competency within the maximum period of any placement order permitted under this section.\n\n(g) Court procedure if finding that defendant will not regain competency. If, at the hearing, the court finds that there is not a substantial probability that the defendant, if provided with a course of treatment, will regain competency within the period of any placement order under this section, the court shall follow the procedure set forth in subsection (m) of this section.\n\n(h) Court procedure if finding that defendant will regain competency. Placement of defendant for treatment or pending civil commitment proceedings. Progress report. (1) If, at the hearing, the court finds that there is a substantial probability that the defendant, if provided with a course of treatment, will regain competency within the period of any placement order under this section, the court shall either (A) order placement of the defendant for treatment for the purpose of rendering the defendant competent, or (B) order placement of the defendant at a treatment facility pending civil commitment proceedings pursuant to subdivision (2) of this subsection.\n\n(2) (A) Except as provided in subparagraph (B) of this subdivision, if the court makes a finding pursuant to subdivision (1) of this subsection and does not order placement pursuant to subparagraph (A) of said subdivision, the court shall, on its own motion or on motion of the state or the defendant, order placement of the defendant in the custody of the Commissioner of Mental Health and Addiction Services at a treatment facility pending civil commitment proceedings. The treatment facility shall be determined by the Commissioner of Mental Health and Addiction Services. Such order shall: (i) Include an authorization for the Commissioner of Mental Health and Addiction Services to apply for civil commitment of such defendant pursuant to sections 17a-495 to 17a-528 , inclusive; (ii) permit the defendant to agree to request voluntarily to be admitted under section 17a-506 and participate voluntarily in a treatment plan prepared by the Commissioner of Mental Health and Addiction Services, and require that the defendant comply with such treatment plan; and (iii) provide that if the application for civil commitment is denied or not pursued by the Commissioner of Mental Health and Addiction Services, or if the defendant is unwilling or unable to comply with a treatment plan despite reasonable efforts of the treatment facility to encourage the defendant's compliance, the person in charge of the treatment facility, or such person's designee, shall submit a written progress report to the court and the defendant shall be returned to the court for a hearing pursuant to subsection (k) of this section. Such written progress report shall include the status of any civil commitment proceedings concerning the defendant, the defendant's compliance with the treatment plan, an opinion regarding the defendant's current competency to stand trial, the clinical findings of the person submitting the report and the facts upon which the findings are based, and any other information concerning the defendant requested by the court, including, but not limited to, the method of treatment or the type, dosage and effect of any medication the defendant is receiving. The Court Support Services Division shall monitor the defendant's compliance with any applicable provisions of such order. The period of placement and monitoring under such order shall not exceed the period of the maximum sentence which the defendant could receive on conviction of the charges against such defendant, or eighteen months, whichever is less. If the defendant has complied with such treatment plan and any applicable provisions of such order, at the end of the period of placement and monitoring, the court shall approve the entry of a nolle prosequi to the charges against the defendant or shall dismiss such charges.\n\n(B) This subdivision shall not apply: (i) To any person charged with a class A felony, a class B felony, except a violation of section 53a-122 that does not involve the use, attempted use or threatened use of physical force against another person, or a violation of section 53a-70b of the general statutes, revision of 1958, revised to January 1, 2019, or section 14-227a or 14-227m , subdivision (1) or (2) of subsection (a) of section 14-227n , subdivision (2) of subsection (a) of section 53-21 or section 53a-56b , 53a-60d , 53a-70 , 53a-70a , 53a-71 , 53a-72a or 53a-72b ; (ii) to any person charged with a crime or motor vehicle violation who, as a result of the commission of such crime or motor vehicle violation, causes the death of another person; or (iii) unless good cause is shown, to any person charged with a class C felony.\n\n(i) Placement for treatment. Conditions. (1) The placement of the defendant for treatment for the purpose of rendering the defendant competent shall comply with the following conditions: (A) The period of placement under the order or combination of orders shall not exceed the period of the maximum sentence which the defendant could receive on conviction of the charges against the defendant or eighteen months, whichever is less; (B) the placement shall be either (i) in the custody of the Commissioner of Mental Health and Addiction Services, the Commissioner of Children and Families or the Commissioner of Developmental Services, except that any defendant placed for treatment with the Commissioner of Mental Health and Addiction Services may remain in the custody of the Department of Correction pursuant to subsection (p) of this section; or, (ii) if the defendant or the appropriate commissioner agrees to provide payment, in the custody of any appropriate mental health facility or treatment program which agrees to provide treatment to the defendant and to adhere to the requirements of this section; and (C) the court shall order the placement, on either an inpatient or an outpatient basis, which the court finds is the least restrictive placement appropriate and available to restore competency.\n\n(2) In determining the least restrictive placement appropriate and available to restore competency, the court shall consider the following factors: (A) The nature and circumstances of the alleged crime; (B) such defendant's record of criminal convictions; (C) such defendant's record of appearance in court; (D) such defendant's family and community ties; (E) such defendant's willingness and ability to engage with treatment ordered under this section; (F) whether such defendant's use of substances would interfere with such defendant's ability to be successful in such placement; (G) any psychiatric symptoms experienced by such defendant and the nature and severity of the symptoms; and (H) any other relevant factors specific to the defendant and such defendant's circumstances.\n\n(3) If the defendant is not charged with a felony, the court shall presume that outpatient treatment is the least restrictive placement appropriate and available to restore competency, unless the court has good cause to find otherwise based on review of the factors in subdivision (2) of this subsection. If outpatient treatment is the least restrictive placement for a defendant who has not yet been released from a correctional facility, the court shall consider whether the availability of such treatment is a sufficient basis on which to release the defendant on a promise to appear, conditions of release, cash bail or bond. If the court determines that the defendant may not be so released, the court shall order treatment of the defendant on an inpatient basis at a mental health facility or facility for persons with intellectual disability. Not later than twenty-four hours after the court orders placement of the defendant for treatment for the purpose of rendering the defendant competent, the examiners shall transmit information obtained about the defendant during the course of an examination pursuant to subsection (d) of this section to the health care provider named in the court's order.\n\n(j) Progress reports re treatment. The person in charge of the treatment facility, or such person's designee, or the Commissioner of Mental Health and Addiction Services with respect to any defendant who is in the custody of the Commissioner of Correction pursuant to subsection (p) of this section, shall submit a written progress report to the court (1) at least seven days prior to the date of any hearing on the issue of the defendant's competency; (2) whenever he or she believes that the defendant has attained competency; (3) whenever he or she believes that there is not a substantial probability that the defendant will attain competency within the period covered by the placement order; (4) whenever, within the first one hundred twenty days of the period covered by the placement order, he or she believes that the defendant would be eligible for civil commitment pursuant to subdivision (2) of subsection (h) of this section; or (5) whenever he or she believes that the defendant is still not competent but has improved sufficiently such that continued inpatient commitment is no longer the least restrictive placement appropriate and available to restore competency. The progress report shall contain: (A) The clinical findings of the person submitting the report and the facts on which the findings are based; (B) the opinion of the person submitting the report as to whether the defendant has attained competency or as to whether the defendant is making progress, under treatment, toward attaining competency within the period covered by the placement order; (C) the opinion of the person submitting the report as to whether the defendant appears to be eligible for civil commitment to a hospital for psychiatric disabilities pursuant to subsection (m) of this section and the appropriateness of such civil commitment, if there is not a substantial probability that the defendant will attain competency within the period covered by the placement order; and (D) any other information concerning the defendant requested by the court, including, but not limited to, the method of treatment or the type, dosage and effect of any medication the defendant is receiving. Not later than five business days after the court finds either that the defendant will not attain competency within the period of any placement order under this section or that the defendant has regained competency, the person in charge of the treatment facility, or such person's designee, or the Commissioner of Mental Health and Addiction Services with respect to any defendant who is in the custody of the Commissioner of Correction pursuant to subsection (p) of this section, shall provide a copy of the written progress report to the examiners who examined the defendant pursuant to subsection (d) of this section.\n\n(k) Reconsideration of competency. Hearing. Involuntary medication. Appointment and duties of health care guardian. (1) Whenever any placement order for treatment is rendered or continued, the court shall set a date for a hearing, to be held within ninety days, for reconsideration of the issue of the defendant's competency. Whenever the court (A) receives a report pursuant to subsection (j) of this section which indicates that (i) the defendant has attained competency, (ii) the defendant will not attain competency within the remainder of the period covered by the placement order, (iii) the defendant will not attain competency within the remainder of the period covered by the placement order absent administration of psychiatric medication for which the defendant is unwilling or unable to provide consent, (iv) the defendant would be eligible for civil commitment pursuant to subdivision (2) of subsection (h) of this section, or (v) the defendant is still not competent but has improved sufficiently such that continued inpatient commitment is no longer the least restrictive placement appropriate and available to restore competency, or (B) receives a report pursuant to subparagraph (A)(iii) of subdivision (2) of subsection (h) of this section which indicates that (i) the application for civil commitment of the defendant has been denied or has not been pursued by the Commissioner of Mental Health and Addiction Services, or (ii) the defendant is unwilling or unable to comply with a treatment plan despite reasonable efforts of the treatment facility to encourage the defendant's compliance, the court shall set the matter for a hearing not later than ten days after the report is received. The hearing may be waived by the defendant only if the report indicates that the defendant is competent. With respect to a defendant who is in the custody of the Commissioner of Correction pursuant to subsection (p) of this section, the Commissioner of Mental Health and Addiction Services shall retain responsibility for providing testimony at any hearing under this subsection. The court shall determine whether the defendant is competent or is making progress toward attaining competency within the period covered by the placement order. If the court finds that the defendant is competent, the defendant shall be returned to the custody of the Commissioner of Correction or released, if the defendant has met the conditions for release, and the court shall continue with the criminal proceedings. If the court finds that the defendant is still not competent but that the defendant is making progress toward attaining competency, the court may continue or modify the placement order. If the court finds that the defendant is still not competent but that the defendant is making progress toward attaining competency and inpatient placement is no longer the least restrictive placement appropriate and available to restore competency, the court shall consider whether the availability of such less restrictive placement is a sufficient basis on which to release the defendant on a promise to appear, conditions of release, cash bail or bond and may order continued treatment to restore competency on an outpatient basis. If the court finds that the defendant is still not competent and will not attain competency within the remainder of the period covered by the placement order absent administration of psychiatric medication for which the defendant is unwilling or unable to provide consent, the court shall proceed as provided in subdivisions (2), (3) and (4) of this subsection. If the court finds that the defendant is eligible for civil commitment, the court may order placement of the defendant at a treatment facility pending civil commitment proceedings pursuant to subdivision (2) of subsection (h) of this section.\n\n(2) If the court finds that the defendant will not attain competency within the remainder of the period covered by the placement order absent administration of psychiatric medication for which the defendant is unwilling or unable to provide consent, and after any hearing held pursuant to subdivision (3) of this subsection, the court may order the involuntary medication of the defendant if the court finds by clear and convincing evidence that: (A) To a reasonable degree of medical certainty, involuntary medication of the defendant will render the defendant competent to stand trial, (B) an adjudication of guilt or innocence cannot be had using less intrusive means, (C) the proposed treatment plan is narrowly tailored to minimize intrusion on the defendant's liberty and privacy interests, (D) the proposed drug regimen will not cause an unnecessary risk to the defendant's health, and (E) the seriousness of the alleged crime is such that the criminal law enforcement interest of the state in fairly and accurately determining the defendant's guilt or innocence overrides the defendant's interest in self-determination.\n\n(3) (A) If the court finds that the defendant is unwilling or unable to provide consent for the administration of psychiatric medication, and prior to deciding whether to order the involuntary medication of the defendant under subdivision (2) of this subsection, the court shall appoint a health care guardian who shall be a licensed health care provider with specialized training in the treatment of persons with psychiatric disabilities to represent the health care interests of the defendant before the court. Notwithstanding the provisions of section 52-146e , such health care guardian shall have access to the psychiatric records of the defendant. Such health care guardian shall file a report with the court not later than thirty days after his or her appointment. The report shall set forth such health care guardian's findings and recommendations concerning the administration of psychiatric medication to the defendant, including the risks and benefits of such medication, the likelihood and seriousness of any adverse side effects and the prognosis with and without such medication. The court shall hold a hearing on the matter not later than ten days after receipt of such health care guardian's report and shall, in deciding whether to order the involuntary medication of the defendant, take into account such health care guardian's opinion concerning the health care interests of the defendant.\n\n(B) The court, in anticipation of considering continued involuntary medication of the defendant under subdivision (4) of this subsection, shall order the health care guardian to file a supplemental report updating the findings and recommendations contained in the health care guardian's report filed under subparagraph (A) of this subdivision.\n\n(4) If, after the defendant has been found to have attained competency by means of involuntary medication ordered under subdivision (2) of this subsection, the court determines by clear and convincing evidence that the defendant will not remain competent absent the continued administration of psychiatric medication for which the defendant is unable to provide consent, and after any hearing held pursuant to subdivision (3) of this subsection and consideration of the supplemental report of the health care guardian, the court may order continued involuntary medication of the defendant if the court finds by clear and convincing evidence that: (A) To a reasonable degree of medical certainty, continued involuntary medication of the defendant will maintain the defendant's competency to stand trial, (B) an adjudication of guilt or innocence cannot be had using less intrusive means, (C) the proposed treatment plan is narrowly tailored to minimize intrusion on the defendant's liberty and privacy interests, (D) the proposed drug regimen will not cause an unnecessary risk to the defendant's health, and (E) the seriousness of the alleged crime is such that the criminal law enforcement interest of the state in fairly and accurately determining the defendant's guilt or innocence overrides the defendant's interest in self-determination. Continued involuntary medication ordered under this subdivision may be administered to the defendant while the criminal charges against the defendant are pending and the defendant is in the custody of the Commissioner of Correction or the Commissioner of Mental Health and Addiction Services. An order for continued involuntary medication of the defendant under this subdivision shall be reviewed by the court every one hundred eighty days while such order remains in effect. The court shall order the health care guardian to file a supplemental report for each such review. After any hearing held pursuant to subdivision (3) of this subsection and consideration of the supplemental report of the health care guardian, the court may continue such order if the court finds, by clear and convincing evidence, that the criteria enumerated in subparagraphs (A) to (E), inclusive, of this subdivision are met.\n\n(5) The state shall hold harmless and indemnify any health care guardian appointed by the court pursuant to subdivision (3) of this subsection from financial loss and expense arising out of any claim, demand, suit or judgment by reason of such health care guardian's alleged negligence or alleged deprivation of any person's civil rights or other act or omission resulting in damage or injury, provided the health care guardian is found to have been acting in the discharge of his or her duties pursuant to said subdivision and such act or omission is found not to have been wanton, reckless or malicious. The provisions of subsections (b), (c) and (d) of section 5-141d shall apply to such health care guardian. The provisions of chapter 53 shall not apply to a claim against such health care guardian.\n\n(l) Failure of defendant to return to treatment facility in accordance with terms and conditions of release. If a defendant who has been ordered placed for treatment on an inpatient basis at a mental health facility or a facility for persons with intellectual disability is released from such facility on a furlough or for work, therapy or any other reason and fails to return to the facility in accordance with the terms and conditions of the defendant's release, the person in charge of the facility, or such person's designee, shall, within twenty-four hours of the defendant's failure to return, report such failure to the prosecuting authority for the court location which ordered the placement of the defendant. Upon receipt of such a report, the prosecuting authority shall, within available resources, make reasonable efforts to notify any victim or victims of the crime for which the defendant is charged of such defendant's failure to return to the facility. No civil liability shall be incurred by the state or the prosecuting authority for failure to notify any victim or victims in accordance with this subsection. The failure of a defendant to return to the facility in which the defendant has been placed may constitute sufficient cause for the defendant's rearrest upon order by the court.\n\n(m) Release or placement of defendant who will not attain competency. Report to court prior to release from placement. (1) If at any time the court determines that there is not a substantial probability that the defendant will attain competency within the period of treatment allowed by this section, or if at the end of such period the court finds that the defendant is still not competent, the court shall consider any recommendation made by the examiners pursuant to subsection (d) of this section and any opinion submitted by the treatment facility pursuant to subparagraph (C) of subsection (j) of this section regarding eligibility for, and the appropriateness of, civil commitment to a hospital for psychiatric disabilities and shall either release the defendant from custody or order the defendant placed in the custody of the Commissioner of Mental Health and Addiction Services, the Commissioner of Children and Families or the Commissioner of Developmental Services. If the court orders the defendant placed in the custody of the Commissioner of Children and Families or the Commissioner of Developmental Services, the commissioner given custody, or the commissioner's designee, shall then apply for civil commitment in accordance with sections 17a-75 to 17a-83 , inclusive, or 17a-270 to 17a-282 , inclusive. If the court orders the defendant placed in the custody of the Commissioner of Mental Health and Addiction Services, the court may order the commissioner, or the commissioner's designee, to apply for civil commitment in accordance with sections 17a-495 to 17a-528 , inclusive, or order the commissioner, or the commissioner's designee, to provide services to the defendant in a less restrictive setting, provided the examiners have determined in the written report filed pursuant to subsection (d) of this section or have testified pursuant to subsection (e) of this section that such services are available and appropriate. If the court orders the defendant placed in the custody of the Commissioner of Mental Health and Addiction Services and orders the commissioner to apply for civil commitment pursuant to this subsection, the court may order the commissioner to give the court notice when the defendant is released from the commissioner's custody if such release is prior to the expiration of the time within which the defendant may be prosecuted for the crime with which the defendant is charged, provided such order indicates when such time expires. If the court orders the defendant placed in the custody of the Commissioner of Developmental Services for purposes of commitment under any provision of sections 17a-270 to 17a-282 , inclusive, the court may order the Commissioner of Developmental Services to give the court notice when the defendant's commitment is terminated if such termination is prior to the expiration of the time within which the defendant may be prosecuted for the crime with which the defendant is charged, provided such order indicates when such time expires.\n\n(2) The court shall hear arguments as to whether the defendant should be released or should be placed in the custody of the Commissioner of Mental Health and Addiction Services, the Commissioner of Children and Families or the Commissioner of Developmental Services.\n\n(3) If the court orders the release of a defendant charged with the commission of a crime that resulted in the death or serious physical injury, as defined in section 53a-3 , of another person, or with a violation of section 53a-70b of the general statutes, revision of 1958, revised to January 1, 2019, or subdivision (2) of subsection (a) of section 53-21 , subdivision (2) of subsection (a) of section 53a-60 or section 53a-60a , 53a-70 , 53a-70a , 53a-71 , 53a-72a or 53a-72b , or orders the placement of such defendant in the custody of the Commissioner of Mental Health and Addiction Services or the Commissioner of Developmental Services, the court may, on its own motion or on motion of the prosecuting authority, order, as a condition of such release or placement, periodic examinations of the defendant as to the defendant's competency at intervals of not less than six months. If, at any time after the initial periodic examination, the court finds again, based upon an examiner's recommendation, that there is a substantial probability that the defendant, if provided with a course of treatment, will never regain competency, then any subsequent periodic examination of the defendant as to the defendant's competency shall be at intervals of not less than eighteen months. Such an examination shall be conducted in accordance with subsection (d) of this section. Periodic examinations ordered by the court under this subsection shall continue until the court finds that the defendant has attained competency or until the time within which the defendant may be prosecuted for the crime with which the defendant is charged, as provided in section 54-193 , has expired, whichever occurs first.\n\n(4) Upon receipt of the written report as provided in subsection (d) of this section, the court shall, upon the request of either party filed not later than thirty days after the court receives such report, conduct a hearing as provided in subsection (e) of this section. Such hearing shall be held not later than ninety days after the court receives such report. If the court finds that the defendant has attained competency, the defendant shall be returned to the custody of the Commissioner of Correction or released, if the defendant has met the conditions for release, and the court shall continue with the criminal proceedings.\n\n(5) The court shall dismiss, with or without prejudice, any charges for which a nolle prosequi is not entered when the time within which the defendant may be prosecuted for the crime with which the defendant is charged, as provided in section 54-193 , has expired. Notwithstanding the record erasure provisions of section 54-142a , police and court records and records of any state's attorney pertaining to a charge which is nolled or dismissed without prejudice while the defendant is not competent shall not be erased until the time for the prosecution of the defendant expires under section 54-193 . A defendant who is not civilly committed as a result of an application made by the Commissioner of Mental Health and Addiction Services, the Commissioner of Children and Families or the Commissioner of Developmental Services pursuant to this section shall be released. A defendant who is civilly committed pursuant to such an application shall be treated in the same manner as any other civilly committed person.\n\n(n) Payment of costs. The cost of the examination effected by the Commissioner of Mental Health and Addiction Services and of testimony of persons conducting the examination effected by the commissioner shall be paid by the Department of Mental Health and Addiction Services. The cost of the examination and testimony by physicians appointed by the court shall be paid by the Judicial Department. If the defendant is indigent, the fee of the person selected by the defendant to observe the examination and to testify on the defendant's behalf shall be paid by the Public Defender Services Commission. The expense of treating a defendant placed in the custody of the Commissioner of Mental Health and Addiction Services, the Commissioner of Children and Families or the Commissioner of Developmental Services pursuant to subdivision (2) of subsection (h) of this section or subsection (i) of this section shall be computed and paid for in the same manner as is provided for persons committed by a probate court under the provisions of sections 17b-122 , 17b-124 to 17b-132 , inclusive, 17b-136 to 17b-138 , inclusive, 17b-194 to 17b-197 , inclusive, 17b-222 to 17b-250 , inclusive, 17b-263 , 17b-340 to 17b-350 , inclusive, 17b-689b and 17b-743 to 17b-747 , inclusive.\n\n(o) Custody of defendant prior to hearing. Until the hearing is held, the defendant, if not released on a promise to appear, conditions of release, cash bail or bond, shall remain in the custody of the Commissioner of Correction unless hospitalized as provided in sections 17a-512 to 17a-517 , inclusive.\n\n(p) Placement of defendant who presents significant security, safety or medical risk. Defendant remaining in custody of Commissioner of Correction. (1) This section shall not be construed to require the Commissioner of Mental Health and Addiction Services to place any defendant who presents a significant security, safety or medical risk in a hospital for psychiatric disabilities which does not have the trained staff, facilities or security to accommodate such a person, as determined by the Commissioner of Mental Health and Addiction Services in consultation with the Commissioner of Correction.\n\n(2) If a defendant is placed for treatment with the Commissioner of Mental Health and Addiction Services pursuant to subsection (i) of this section and such defendant is not placed in a hospital for psychiatric disabilities pursuant to a determination made by the Commissioner of Mental Health and Addiction Services under subdivision (1) of this subsection, the defendant shall remain in the custody of the Commissioner of Correction. The Commissioner of Correction shall be responsible for the medical and psychiatric care of the defendant, and the Commissioner of Mental Health and Addiction Services shall remain responsible to provide other appropriate services to restore competency.\n\n(3) If a defendant remains in the custody of the Commissioner of Correction pursuant to subdivision (2) of this subsection and the court finds that the defendant is still not competent and will not attain competency within the remainder of the period covered by the placement order absent administration of psychiatric medication for which the defendant is unwilling or unable to provide consent, the court shall proceed as provided in subdivisions (2), (3) and (4) of subsection (k) of this section. Nothing in this subdivision shall prevent the court from making any other finding or order set forth in subsection (k) of this section.\n\n(q) Defense of defendant prior to trial. This section shall not prevent counsel for the defendant from raising, prior to trial and while the defendant is not competent, any issue susceptible of fair determination.\n\n(r) Credit for time in confinement on inpatient basis. Actual time spent in confinement on an inpatient basis pursuant to this section shall be credited against any sentence imposed on the defendant in the pending criminal case or in any other case arising out of the same conduct in the same manner as time is credited for time spent in a correctional facility awaiting trial.\n\nSee Sec. 17a-543a re appointment of special limited conservator for and administration of medication to defendant placed in custody of Commissioner of Mental Health and Addiction Services.\n\nSee Sec. 17a-566 re required examination for signs of mental illness of persons convicted of certain crimes."

              "(a) There shall be a pretrial program for accelerated rehabilitation of persons accused of a crime or crimes or a motor vehicle violation or violations for which a sentence to a term of imprisonment may be imposed, which crimes or violations are not of a serious nature. Upon application by any such person for participation in the program, the court shall, but only as to the public, order the court file sealed.",
              "(b) The court may, in its discretion, invoke such program on motion of the defendant or on motion of a state's attorney or prosecuting attorney with respect to a defendant (1) who, the court believes, will probably not offend in the future, (2) who has no previous record of conviction of a crime or of a violation of section 14-196 , subsection (c) of section 14-215 , section 14-222a , subsection (a) or subdivision (1) of subsection (b) of section 14-224 , section 14-227a or 14-227m , subdivision (1) or (2) of subsection (a) of section 14-227n or section 15-132a , 15-133 or 15-140n , and (3) who states under oath, in open court or before any person designated by the clerk and duly authorized to administer oaths, under the penalties of perjury, (A) that the defendant has never had such program invoked on the defendant's behalf or that the defendant was charged with a misdemeanor or a motor vehicle violation for which a term of imprisonment of one year or less may be imposed and ten or more years have passed since the date that any charge or charges for which the program was invoked on the defendant's behalf were dismissed by the court, or (B) with respect to a defendant who is a veteran, that the defendant has not had such program invoked in the defendant's behalf more than once previously, provided the defendant shall agree thereto and provided notice has been given by the defendant, on a form prescribed by the Office of the Chief Court Administrator, to the victim or victims of such crime or motor vehicle violation, if any, by registered or certified mail and such victim or victims have an opportunity to be heard thereon.

Any defendant who applies for participation in such program shall pay to the court an application fee of thirty-five dollars, except as provided in subsection (g) of this section. No defendant shall be allowed to participate in the pretrial program for accelerated rehabilitation more than two times.

Any defendant who enters such program shall agree to the tolling of any statute of limitations with respect to such crime and to a waiver of the right to a speedy trial. Any such defendant shall appear in court and shall, under such conditions as the court shall order, be released to the supervision of the Court Support Services Division, except that, if a criminal docket for drug-dependent persons has been established pursuant to section 51-181b in the judicial district, such defendant may be transferred, under such conditions as the court shall order, to the court handling such docket for supervision by such court. If the defendant refuses to accept, or, having accepted, violates such conditions, the defendant's case shall be brought to trial. The period of such probation or supervision, or both, shall not exceed two years. If the defendant has reached the age of sixteen years but has not reached the age of eighteen years, the court may order that as a condition of such probation the defendant be referred for services to a youth service bureau established pursuant to section 10-19m , provided the court finds, through an assessment by a youth service bureau or its designee, that the defendant is in need of and likely to benefit from such services. When determining any conditions of probation to order for a person entering such program who was charged with a misdemeanor that did not involve the use, attempted use or threatened use of physical force against another person or a motor vehicle violation, the court shall consider ordering the person to perform community service in the community in which the offense or violation occurred. If the court determines that community service is appropriate, such community service may be implemented by a community court established in accordance with section 51-181c if the offense or violation occurred within the jurisdiction of a community court established by said section. If the defendant is charged with a violation of section 46a-58 , 53-37a , 53a-181j , 53a-181k or 53a-181 l , the court may order that as a condition of such probation the defendant participate in a hate crimes diversion program as provided in subsection (e) of this section. If a defendant is charged with a violation of section 53-247 , the court may order that as a condition of such probation the defendant undergo psychiatric or psychological counseling or participate in an animal cruelty prevention and education program provided such a program exists and is available to the defendant.\n\n(e) If the court orders the defendant to participate in a hate crimes diversion program as a condition of probation, the defendant shall pay to the court a participation fee of four hundred twenty-five dollars, except as provided in subsection (g) of this section. The Judicial Department shall contract with service providers, develop standards and oversee appropriate hate crimes diversion programs to meet the requirements of this section. Any defendant whose employment or residence makes it unreasonable to attend a hate crimes diversion program in this state may attend a program in another state which has standards substantially similar to, or higher than, those of this state, subject to the approval of the court and payment of the application and program fees as provided in this section. The hate crimes diversion program shall consist of an educational program and supervised community service.\n\n(f) If a defendant released to the supervision of the Court Support Services Division satisfactorily completes such defendant's period of probation, such defendant may apply for dismissal of the charges against such defendant and the court, on finding such satisfactory completion, shall dismiss such charges. If the defendant does not apply for dismissal of the charges against such defendant after satisfactorily completing such defendant's period of probation, the court, upon receipt of a report submitted by the Court Support Services Division that the defendant satisfactorily completed such defendant's period of probation, may on its own motion make a finding of such satisfactory completion and dismiss such charges. If a defendant transferred to the court handling the criminal docket for drug-dependent persons satisfactorily completes such defendant's period of supervision, the court shall release the defendant to the supervision of the Court Support Services Division under such conditions as the court shall order or shall dismiss such charges. Upon dismissal, all records of such charges shall be erased pursuant to section 54-142a . An order of the court denying a motion to dismiss the charges against a defendant who has completed such defendant's period of probation or supervision or terminating the participation of a defendant in such program shall be a final judgment for purposes of appeal.\n\n(g) The court shall waive any application or participation fee under this section for any person who (1) files with the court an affidavit of indigency or inability to pay, assisted by the Court Support Services Division, to the extent requested by such person, and the court enters a finding of inability to pay, or (2) has been determined indigent and eligible for representation by a public defender who has been appointed on behalf of such person pursuant to section 51-296 . The court shall not require a person to perform community service in lieu of payment of such fee, if such fee is waived."

The Court Support Services Division, in making its assessment and confirmation, may rely on the representations made by the applicant under oath in open court with respect to convictions in other states of offenses specified in subsection (a) of this section. Upon confirmation of eligibility and receipt of the evaluation report, the defendant shall be referred to the Department of Mental Health and Addiction Services by the Court Support Services Division for placement in an appropriate alcohol intervention program for one year, or be placed in a state-licensed substance abuse treatment program.

The suspension of the motor vehicle operator's license of any such person pursuant to section 14-227b shall be effective during the period such person is participating in the pretrial alcohol education program, provided such person shall have the option of not commencing the participation in such program until the period of such suspension is completed. If the Court Support Services Division informs the court that the defendant is ineligible for such program and the court makes a determination of ineligibility or if the program provider certifies to the court that the defendant did not successfully complete the assigned program or is no longer amenable to treatment and such person does not request, or the court denies, program reinstatement under subsection (e) of this section, the court shall order the court file to be unsealed, enter a plea of not guilty for such defendant and immediately place the case on the trial list. If such defendant satisfactorily completes the assigned program, such defendant may apply for dismissal of the charges against such defendant and the court, on reviewing the record of the defendant's participation in such program submitted by the Court Support Services Division and on finding such satisfactory completion, shall dismiss the charges. If the defendant does not apply for dismissal of the charges against such defendant after satisfactorily completing the assigned program the court, upon receipt of the record of the defendant's participation in such program submitted by the Court Support Services Division, may on its own motion make a finding of such satisfactory completion and dismiss the charges. Upon motion of the defendant and a showing of good cause, the court may extend the one-year placement period for a reasonable period for the defendant to complete the assigned program. A record of participation in such program shall be retained by the Court Support Services Division for a period of ten years from the date the court grants the application for participation in such program.

If the court grants the application for participation in the pretrial alcohol education program and such person is ordered to participate in a substance abuse treatment program, such person shall be responsible for the costs associated with participation in such program. No person may be excluded from either program for inability to pay such fee or cost, and the court shall waive any such fee or cost for any intervention program if such person is found eligible to have such fee or cost waived under subsection (i) of this section.",
              "(2) If the court finds that a person is indigent or unable to pay for a treatment program using the method for determining indigency described in subsection (i) of this section, the costs of such program shall be paid from the pretrial account established under section 54-56k .",
              "(3) If the court denies the application, such person shall not be required to pay the program fee.

              "(d) If a person returns to court with certification from a program provider that such person did not successfully complete the assigned program or is no longer amenable to treatment, the provider, to the extent practicable, shall include a recommendation to the court as to whether a ten-session intervention program, a fifteen-session intervention program or placement in a state-licensed substance abuse treatment program would best serve such person's needs. The provider shall also indicate whether the current program referral was an initial referral or a reinstatement to the program.",
              "(e) When a person subsequently requests reinstatement into an alcohol intervention program or a substance abuse treatment program and the Court Support Services Division verifies that such person is eligible for reinstatement into such program and thereafter the court favorably acts on such request, such person shall pay a nonrefundable program fee of one hundred seventy-five dollars if ordered to complete a ten-session intervention program or two hundred fifty dollars if ordered to complete a fifteen-session intervention program, as the case may be, except as provided in subsection (i) of this section. If the court grants a person's request to be reinstated into a treatment program, such person shall be responsible for the costs, if any, associated with being reinstated into the treatment program. All program fees collected in connection with a reinstatement to an intervention program shall be credited to the pretrial account established under section 54-56k . No person shall be permitted more than two program reinstatements pursuant to this subsection.",
              "(f) The Department of Mental Health and Addiction Services shall contract with service providers, develop standards and oversee appropriate alcohol programs to meet the requirements of this section. Said department shall adopt regulations, in accordance with chapter 54, to establish standards for such alcohol programs. Any person ordered to participate in a treatment program shall do so at a state-licensed treatment program which meets the standards established by said department. Any defendant whose employment or residence makes it unreasonable to attend an alcohol intervention program or a substance abuse treatment program in this state may attend a program in another state which has standards substantially similar to, or higher than, those of this state, subject to the approval of the court and payment of the application, evaluation and program fees and treatment costs, as appropriate, as provided in this section.",
              "(g) The court may, as a condition of granting such application, require that such person participate in a victim impact panel program approved by the Court Support Services Division of the Judicial Department. Such victim impact panel program shall provide a nonconfrontational forum for the victims of alcohol-related or drug-related offenses and offenders to share experiences on the impact of alcohol-related or drug-related incidents in their lives. Such victim impact panel program shall be conducted by a nonprofit organization that advocates on behalf of victims of accidents caused by persons who operated a motor vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating liquor or any drug, or both.

The Court Support Services Division, in making its assessment and confirmation, may rely on the representations made by the applicant under oath in open court with respect to convictions in other states of offenses specified in subsection (a) of this section. Upon confirmation of eligibility and receipt of the evaluation report, the defendant shall be referred to the Department of Mental Health and Addiction Services by the Court Support Services Division for placement in an appropriate alcohol intervention program for one year, or be placed in a state-licensed substance abuse treatment program. The alcohol intervention program shall include a ten-session intervention program and a fifteen-session intervention program. Any person who enters the pretrial alcohol education program shall agree: (1) To the tolling of the statute of limitations with respect to such crime, (2) to a waiver of such person's right to a speedy trial, (3) to complete ten or fifteen counseling sessions in an alcohol intervention program or successfully complete a substance abuse treatment program of not less than twelve sessions pursuant to this section dependent upon the evaluation report and the court order, (4) to commence participation in an alcohol intervention program or substance abuse treatment program not later than ninety days after the date of entry of the court order unless granted a delayed entry into a program by the court, (5) upon completion of participation in the alcohol intervention program, to accept placement in a substance abuse treatment program upon the recommendation of a provider under contract with the Department of Mental Health and Addiction Services pursuant to subsection (f) of this section or placement in a state-licensed substance abuse treatment program which meets standards established by the Department of Mental Health and Addiction Services, if the Court Support Services Division deems it appropriate, and (6) if ordered by the court, to participate in at least one victim impact panel. The suspension of the motor vehicle operator's license of any such person pursuant to section 14-227b shall be effective during the period such person is participating in the pretrial alcohol education program, provided such person shall have the option of not commencing the participation in such program until the period of such suspension is completed. If the Court Support Services Division informs the court that the defendant is ineligible for such program and the court makes a determination of ineligibility or if the program provider certifies to the court that the defendant did not successfully complete the assigned program or is no longer amenable to treatment and such person does not request, or the court denies, program reinstatement under subsection (e) of this section, the court shall order the court file to be unsealed, enter a plea of not guilty for such defendant and immediately place the case on the trial list. If such defendant satisfactorily completes the assigned program, such defendant may apply for dismissal of the charges against such defendant and the court, on reviewing the record of the defendant's participation in such program submitted by the Court Support Services Division and on finding such satisfactory completion, shall dismiss the charges. If the defendant does not apply for dismissal of the charges against such defendant after satisfactorily completing the assigned program the court, upon receipt of the record of the defendant's participation in such program submitted by the Court Support Services Division, may on its own motion make a finding of such satisfactory completion and dismiss the charges. Upon motion of the defendant and a showing of good cause, the court may extend the one-year placement period for a reasonable period for the defendant to complete the assigned program. A record of participation in such program shall be retained by the Court Support Services Division for a period of ten years from the date the court grants the application for participation in such program. The Court Support Services Division shall transmit to the Department of Motor Vehicles a record of participation in such program for each person who satisfactorily completes such program. The Department of Motor Vehicles shall maintain for a period of ten years the record of a person's participation in such program as part of such person's driving record. The Court Support Services Division shall transmit to the Department of Energy and Environmental Protection the record of participation of any person who satisfactorily completes such program who has been charged with a violation of the provisions of subsection (d) of section 15-133 or section 15-140n . The Department of Energy and Environmental Protection shall maintain for a period of ten years the record of a person's participation in such program as a part of such person's boater certification record.\n\n(c) (1) At the time the court grants the application for participation in the pretrial alcohol education program, such person shall also pay to the court a nonrefundable program fee of three hundred fifty dollars if such person is ordered to participate in the ten-session intervention program and a nonrefundable program fee of five hundred dollars if such person is ordered to participate in the fifteen-session intervention program. If the court grants the application for participation in the pretrial alcohol education program and such person is ordered to participate in a substance abuse treatment program, such person shall be responsible for the costs associated with participation in such program. No person may be excluded from either program for inability to pay such fee or cost, and the court shall waive any such fee or cost for any intervention program if such person is found eligible to have such fee or cost waived under subsection (i) of this section.\n\n(2) If the court finds that a person is indigent or unable to pay for a treatment program using the method for determining indigency described in subsection (i) of this section, the costs of such program shall be paid from the pretrial account established under section 54-56k .\n\n(3) If the court denies the application, such person shall not be required to pay the program fee. If the court grants the application and such person is later determined to be ineligible for participation in such pretrial alcohol education program or fails to complete the assigned program, the program fee shall not be refunded. All program fees shall be credited to the pretrial account established under section 54-56k .\n\n(d) If a person returns to court with certification from a program provider that such person did not successfully complete the assigned program or is no longer amenable to treatment, the provider, to the extent practicable, shall include a recommendation to the court as to whether a ten-session intervention program, a fifteen-session intervention program or placement in a state-licensed substance abuse treatment program would best serve such person's needs. The provider shall also indicate whether the current program referral was an initial referral or a reinstatement to the program.\n\n(e) When a person subsequently requests reinstatement into an alcohol intervention program or a substance abuse treatment program and the Court Support Services Division verifies that such person is eligible for reinstatement into such program and thereafter the court favorably acts on such request, such person shall pay a nonrefundable program fee of one hundred seventy-five dollars if ordered to complete a ten-session intervention program or two hundred fifty dollars if ordered to complete a fifteen-session intervention program, as the case may be, except as provided in subsection (i) of this section. If the court grants a person's request to be reinstated into a treatment program, such person shall be responsible for the costs, if any, associated with being reinstated into the treatment program. All program fees collected in connection with a reinstatement to an intervention program shall be credited to the pretrial account established under section 54-56k . No person shall be permitted more than two program reinstatements pursuant to this subsection.\n\n(f) The Department of Mental Health and Addiction Services shall contract with service providers, develop standards and oversee appropriate alcohol programs to meet the requirements of this section. Said department shall adopt regulations, in accordance with chapter 54, to establish standards for such alcohol programs. Any person ordered to participate in a treatment program shall do so at a state-licensed treatment program which meets the standards established by said department. Any defendant whose employment or residence makes it unreasonable to attend an alcohol intervention program or a substance abuse treatment program in this state may attend a program in another state which has standards substantially similar to, or higher than, those of this state, subject to the approval of the court and payment of the application, evaluation and program fees and treatment costs, as appropriate, as provided in this section.\n\n(g) The court may, as a condition of granting such application, require that such person participate in a victim impact panel program approved by the Court Support Services Division of the Judicial Department. Such victim impact panel program shall provide a nonconfrontational forum for the victims of alcohol-related or drug-related offenses and offenders to share experiences on the impact of alcohol-related or drug-related incidents in their lives. Such victim impact panel program shall be conducted by a nonprofit organization that advocates on behalf of victims of accidents caused by persons who operated a motor vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating liquor or any drug, or both. Such organization may assess a participation fee of not more than seventy-five dollars on any person required by the court to participate in such program, provided such organization shall offer a waiver when such person has been determined indigent and eligible for representation by a public defender who has been appointed on behalf of such person pursuant to section 51-296 .\n\n(h) The provisions of this section shall not be applicable in the case of any person charged with a violation of section 14-227a or 14-227m or subdivision (1) or (2) of subsection (a) of section 14-227n (1) while operating a commercial motor vehicle, as defined in section 14-1 , or (2) who holds a commercial driver's license or commercial learner's permit at the time of the violation.\n\n(i) The court shall waive any fee or cost under subsection (a), (c) or (e) of this section for any person who (1) files with the court an affidavit of indigency or inability to pay, has such indigency confirmed by the Court Support Services Division and the court enters a finding thereof, or (2) has been determined indigent and eligible for representation by a public defender who has been appointed on behalf of such person pursuant to section 51-296 . The court shall not require a person to perform community service in lieu of payment of such fee or cost, if such fee or cost is waived.\n\n(j) A court may not grant an application to participate in the pretrial alcohol education program under this section on or after April 1, 2022. Anyone participating in the program on April 1, 2022, may continue such participation until successful completion of the program or termination of participation in the program after any possible reinstatements in the program."

The evaluation and application fee imposed under this subsection shall be credited to the pretrial account established under section 54-56k .\n\n(c) The court, after consideration of the recommendation of the state's attorney, assistant state's attorney or deputy assistant state's attorney in charge of the case, may, in its discretion, grant such application. If the court grants such application, the court shall refer such person (1) to the Court Support Services Division for confirmation of the eligibility of the applicant, (2) to the Department of Mental Health and Addiction Services for evaluation and determination of an appropriate drug education or substance abuse treatment program for the first or second time such application is granted, and (3) to a state-licensed substance abuse treatment program for evaluation and determination of an appropriate substance abuse treatment program for the third time such application is granted, except that, if such person is a veteran, the court may refer such person to the Department of Veterans Affairs or the United States Department of Veterans Affairs, as applicable, for any such evaluation and determination. For the purposes of this subsection and subsection (d) of this section, “veteran” has the same meaning as provided in section 27-103 .\n\n(d) (1) (A) Upon confirmation of eligibility and receipt of the evaluation and determination required under subsection (c) of this section, such person shall be placed in the pretrial drug education and community service program and referred by the Court Support Services Division for the purpose of receiving appropriate drug education services or substance abuse treatment program services, as recommended by the evaluation conducted pursuant to subsection (c) of this section and ordered by the court, to the Department of Mental Health and Addiction Services or to a state-licensed substance abuse treatment program for placement in the appropriate drug education or substance abuse treatment program, except that, if such person is a veteran, the division may refer such person to the Department of Veterans Affairs or the United States Department of Veterans Affairs, subject to the provisions of subdivision (2) of this subsection.\n\n(B) Persons who have been granted entry into the pretrial drug education and community service program for the first time shall participate in either a fifteen-session drug education program or a substance abuse treatment program of not less than fifteen sessions, as ordered by the court on the basis of the evaluation and determination required under subsection (c) of this section. Persons who have been granted entry into the pretrial drug education and community service program for the second time shall participate in either a fifteen-session drug education program or a substance abuse treatment program of not less than fifteen sessions, as ordered by the court based on the evaluation and determination required under subsection (c) of this section. Persons who have been granted entry into the pretrial drug education and community service program for a third time shall be referred to a state-licensed substance abuse program for evaluation and participation in a course of treatment as ordered by the court based on the evaluation and determination required under subsection (c) of this section.\n\n(C) Persons who have been granted entry into the pretrial drug education and community service program shall also participate in a community service program administered by the Court Support Services Division pursuant to section 53a-39c . Persons who have been granted entry into the pretrial drug education and community service program for the first time shall participate in the community service program for a period of five days.

Persons receiving substance abuse treatment program services in accordance with the provisions of this section shall only receive such services at state-licensed substance abuse treatment program facilities that are in compliance with all state standards governing the operation of such facilities, except that, if such person is a veteran, such person may receive services from facilities under the supervision of the Department of Veterans Affairs or the United States Department of Veterans Affairs, subject to the provisions of subdivision (2) of this subsection.\n\n(E) Any person who enters the pretrial drug education and community service program shall agree: (i) To the tolling of the statute of limitations with respect to such crime; (ii) to a waiver of such person's right to a speedy trial; (iii) to complete participation in the pretrial drug education and community service program, as ordered by the court; (iv) to commence participation in the pretrial drug education and community service program not later than ninety days after the date of entry of the court order unless granted a delayed entry into the program by the court; and (v) upon completion of participation in the pretrial drug education and community service program, to accept (I) placement in a treatment program upon the recommendation of a provider under contract with the Department of Mental Health and Addiction Services or a provider under the supervision of the Department of Veterans Affairs or the United States Department of Veterans Affairs, or (II) placement in a treatment program that has standards substantially similar to, or higher than, a program of a provider under contract with the Department of Mental Health and Addiction Services, if the Court Support Services Division deems it appropriate.\n\n(2) The Court Support Services Division may only refer a veteran to the Department of Veterans Affairs or the United States Department of Veterans Affairs for the receipt of services under the program if (A) the division determines that such services will be provided in a timely manner under standards substantially similar to, or higher than, standards for services provided by the Department of Mental Health and Addiction Services under the program, and (B) the applicable department agrees to submit timely program participation and completion reports to the division in the manner required by the division.\n\n(e) If the Court Support Services Division informs the court that such person is ineligible for the program and the court makes a determination of ineligibility or if the program provider certifies to the court that such person did not successfully complete the assigned program and such person did not request, or the court denied, reinstatement in the program under subsection (i) of this section, the court shall order the court file to be unsealed, enter a plea of not guilty for such person and immediately place the case on the trial list.\n\n(f) If such person satisfactorily completes the assigned program, such person may apply for dismissal of the charges against such person and the court, on reviewing the record of such person's participation in such program submitted by the Court Support Services Division and on finding such satisfactory completion, shall dismiss the charges. If such person does not apply for dismissal of the charges against such person after satisfactorily completing the assigned program, the court, upon receipt of the record of such person's participation in such program submitted by the Court Support Services Division, may on its own motion make a finding of such satisfactory completion and dismiss the charges. Upon motion of such person and a showing of good cause, the court may extend the placement period for a reasonable period of time to allow such person to complete the assigned program. A record of participation in such program shall be retained by the Court Support Services Division for a period of ten years from the date the court grants the application for participation in the program.\n\n(g) At the time the court grants the application for participation in the pretrial drug education and community service program, any person ordered to participate in such drug education program shall pay to the court a nonrefundable program fee of six hundred dollars. If the court orders participation in a substance abuse treatment program, such person shall pay to the court a nonrefundable program fee of one hundred dollars and shall be responsible for the costs associated with such program. No person may be excluded from any such program for inability to pay such fee or cost, and the court shall waive any such fee or cost if such person is found eligible to have such fee or cost waived under subsection (l) of this section. If the court waives the costs for a substance abuse treatment program, the costs of such program shall be paid from the pretrial account established under section 54-56k . If the court denies the application, such person shall not be required to pay the program fee. If the court grants the application, and such person is later determined to be ineligible for participation in such pretrial drug education and community service program or fails to complete the assigned program, the program fee shall not be refunded. All program fees shall be credited to the pretrial account established under section 54-56k .\n\n(h) If a person returns to court with certification from a program provider that such person did not successfully complete the assigned program or is no longer amenable to treatment, the provider, to the extent practicable, shall include a recommendation to the court as to whether placement in a drug education program or placement in a substance abuse treatment program would best serve such person's needs. The provider shall also indicate whether the current program referral was an initial referral or a reinstatement to the program.\n\n(i) When a person subsequently requests reinstatement into a drug education program or a substance abuse treatment program and the Court Support Services Division verifies that such person is eligible for reinstatement into such program and thereafter the court favorably acts on such request, any person reinstated into such drug education program shall pay a nonrefundable program fee of two hundred fifty dollars, and any person reinstated into a substance abuse treatment program shall be responsible for the costs, if any, associated with being reinstated into the treatment program, unless such person is found eligible to have such fee or costs waived under subsection (l) of this section. All program fees collected in connection with a reinstatement to a drug education program shall be credited to the pretrial account established under section 54-56k . No person shall be permitted more than two program reinstatements pursuant to this subsection.\n\n(j) The Department of Mental Health and Addiction Services shall develop standards and oversee appropriate drug education programs that it administers to meet the requirements of this section and may contract with service providers to provide such programs. The department shall adopt regulations, in accordance with chapter 54, to establish standards for such drug education programs.\n\n(k) Any person whose employment or residence or schooling makes it unreasonable to attend a drug education program or substance abuse treatment program in this state may attend a program in another state that has standards similar to, or higher than, those of this state, subject to the approval of the court and payment of the program fee or costs as provided in this section.\n\n(l) The court shall waive any fee or cost under subsection (b), (g) or (i) of this section for any person who (1) files with the court an affidavit of indigency or inability to pay, has such indigency confirmed by the Court Support Services Division and the court enters a finding thereof, or (2) has been determined indigent and eligible for representation by a public defender who has been appointed on behalf of such person pursuant to section 51-296 . The court shall not require a person to perform community service in lieu of payment of such fee or cost, if such fee or cost is waived.\n\n(m) A court may not grant an application to participate in the pretrial drug education and community service program under this section on or after April 1, 2022. Anyone participating in the program on April 1, 2022, may continue such participation until successful completion of the program or termination of participation in the program after any possible reinstatements in the program."

The department may contract with service providers to provide the appropriate drug education component in accordance with the provisions of this section. The department may combine the services for the drug education component of the program under the provisions of this section with the services for the alcohol education component of the impaired driving intervention program under the provisions of section 54-56r , if necessary to ensure the appropriate and timely access to court ordered education components. Participation by a person in any combined drug and alcohol education services provided by the department for the drug education component of the program under the provisions of this section shall not be deemed participation in, nor shall affect such person's eligibility for, the impaired driving intervention program under the provisions of section 54-56r .\n\n(h) (1) All program component providers shall provide the Court Support Services Division with a certification regarding the participation of each person referred to such provider pursuant to this section in the manner required by the division. (A) If such person has successfully completed the applicable program component, the certification shall indicate such successful completion and state whether additional substance use treatment is recommended. (B) If such person has failed to successfully complete the applicable program component, the certification shall indicate the reasons for such failure, whether the person is no longer amenable to education or treatment, and whether the current referral was an initial referral under subsection (d) of this section or a reinstatement under subsection (k) of this section for the program component. The certification of failure shall also, to the extent practicable, include a recommendation as to whether an alternative drug education or substance use treatment component would best serve such person's needs.\n\n(2) Except as provided in subdivision (3) of this subsection, upon receipt of a participation certification from any program component provider pursuant to this subsection, the Court Support Services Division shall provide the court with a final progress report indicating whether such person has successfully completed any components of the program ordered by the court, whether the division required such person to participate in any additional substance use treatment in accordance with subdivision (3) of this subsection and whether such person successfully completed any such additional substance use treatment. The final progress report shall also include any other information the division obtained during the supervision of such person relevant to such person's participation in the program, including whether the results of a criminal history record check, which the division shall complete prior to the submission of the final progress report, reveals that such person has engaged in any conduct that constitutes a violation of section 21a-257 , 21a-267 , 21a-279 or 21a-279a , during such person's period of participation in the program.\n\n(3) If a participation certification indicates that a person who was placed in the program successfully completed the drug education or substance use treatment component ordered by the court, but the program component provider recommends additional substance use treatment for such person, the Court Support Services Division may, if it deems such additional treatment appropriate, require such person to participate in the recommended additional substance use treatment in order to satisfactorily complete the pretrial drug intervention and community service program. If the division requires such additional substance use treatment, the division shall provide the court with a final progress report in accordance with subdivision (2) of this subsection upon receipt of the participation certification from the substance use treatment provider for such additional treatment.\n\n(i) (1) If any person successfully completes all components of the program ordered by the court and any additional substance use treatment required by the Court Support Services Division, such person may apply for dismissal of the charges against such person at the conclusion of such person's period of participation in the program. Upon application, the court shall review the final progress report submitted by the division regarding such person and any other relevant information. If the court finds that such person has satisfactorily completed the pretrial drug intervention and community service program, the court shall dismiss the charges.\n\n(2) If any person who has successfully completed all components of the program ordered by the court and any additional substance use treatment required by the Court Support Services Division does not apply for dismissal of the charges against such person at the conclusion of such person's period of participation in the program, the court may, upon its own motion, review the final progress report regarding such person submitted by the division and any other relevant information. If the court finds that such person has satisfactorily completed the pretrial drug intervention and community service program, the court shall dismiss the charges.\n\n(3) Upon the motion of any person placed in the program and a showing of good cause, the court may extend the program placement period for a reasonable period of time to allow such person to complete the applicable program components.\n\n(j) If, upon review of the final progress report submitted by the Court Support Services Division or any other relevant information, the court finds that any person placed in the program has failed to successfully complete any component of the program ordered by the court, is no longer amenable to treatment or is otherwise ineligible to continue participating in the program, the court shall terminate such person's participation in the program. No program fees or substance use treatment costs imposed pursuant to subsection (e) of this section shall be refunded to any person whose participation in the program is terminated. Unless such person requests, and the court grants, reinstatement into the program pursuant to subsection (k) of this section, the court shall order the court file of any person whose participation in the program is terminated to be unsealed, enter a plea of not guilty for such person and immediately place the case on the trial list.\n\n(k) (1) Any person whose participation in the program is terminated may ask the court to reinstate such person into the program up to two times. If a person requests reinstatement into the program, the Court Support Services Division shall verify that such person is eligible for such reinstatement. If a person requesting reinstatement into the program is eligible for reinstatement, the court may, in its discretion, grant such person reinstatement into the program. When granting such reinstatement, the court shall order the person to participate in an appropriate drug education, substance use treatment or community service component of the program.\n\n(2) Any person reinstated into the program shall (A) if ordered to participate in the drug education component of the program, pay to the court a nonrefundable program fee of two hundred fifty dollars, which shall be credited to the pretrial account established under section 54-56k , or (B) if ordered to participate in the substance use treatment component of the program, pay the costs of any substance use treatment. The court shall not waive the program fee or the costs of substance use treatment associated with reinstatement into the program unless such person is found eligible to have such fee or costs waived under subdivision (2) of subsection (e) of this section and such person participates in the applicable drug education at a service provider located in this state or substance use treatment at a substance use treatment provider licensed by and located in this state.\n\n(l) (1) If any person applies for both the pretrial drug intervention and community service program under the provisions of this section and the pretrial impaired driving intervention program pursuant to section 54-56r , for charges arising from the same arrest, and the Department of Mental Health and Addiction Services has already completed the required evaluation and determination of the appropriate alcohol education or substance use treatment component pursuant to section 54-56r , the court and the Court Support Services Division may rely on such evaluation and determination for the purposes of ordering participation and directing attendance in the drug education or substance use treatment component of the program under the provisions of this section. If the court and the division rely on such evaluation and determination, such person shall not be required to pay the evaluation fee under the provisions of subdivision (2) of subsection (b) of this section, provided that such person has paid, or the court has waived, the evaluation fee pursuant to section 54-56r .\n\n(2) If any person is placed in both the pretrial drug intervention and community service program under the provisions of this section and the pretrial impaired driving intervention program under section 54-56r , for charges arising from the same arrest, the court may find that:\n\n(A) Such person's successful completion of the alcohol education component of the pretrial impaired driving intervention program pursuant to section 54-56r , satisfies such person's required participation in the drug education component of the pretrial drug intervention and community service program under the provisions of this section; or\n\n(B) Such person's successful completion of the substance use treatment component of the pretrial impaired driving intervention program under section 54-56r , satisfies such person's required participation in the substance use treatment component of the pretrial drug intervention and community service program under the provisions of this section.\n\n(3) Nothing in this subsection shall relieve any person placed in both the pretrial drug intervention and community service program pursuant to this section and the pretrial impaired driving intervention program pursuant to section 54-56r , for charges arising from the same arrest, from the requirement to participate in the:\n\n(A) Community service component of the pretrial drug intervention and community service program under the provisions of this section, in order to satisfactorily complete the pretrial drug intervention and community service program; or\n\n(B) Victim impact component of the pretrial impaired driving intervention program, if ordered by the court pursuant to section 54-56r , in order to satisfactorily complete the pretrial impaired driving intervention program.\n\n(m) The Court Support Services Division shall retain a record of participation in the pretrial drug intervention and community service program for a period of ten years from the date the court grants the application for, and places the applicant in, the program pursuant to the provisions of this section.\n\n(n) For purposes of this section, “veteran” has the same meaning as provided in subdivision (2) of subsection (a) of section 27-103 ."

If the division requires such additional substance use treatment, the division shall provide the court with a final progress report in accordance with subdivision (2) of this subsection upon receipt of the participation certification from the substance use treatment provider for such additional treatment.\n\n(k) (1) If any person successfully completes all components of the program ordered by the court and any additional substance use treatment required by the Court Support Services Division, such person may apply for dismissal of the charges against such person at the conclusion of such person's period of participation in the program. Upon application, the court shall review the final progress report submitted by the division regarding such person and any other relevant information. If the court finds that such person has satisfactorily completed the pretrial impaired driving intervention program, the court shall dismiss the charges.\n\n(2) If any person who has successfully completed all components of the program ordered by the court and any additional substance use treatment required by the Court Support Services Division does not apply for dismissal of the charges against such person at the conclusion of such person's period of participation in the program, the court may, upon its own motion, review the final progress report regarding such person submitted by the division and any other relevant information. If the court finds that such person has satisfactorily completed the pretrial impaired driving intervention program, the court shall dismiss the charges.\n\n(3) Upon the motion of any person placed in the program and a showing of good cause, the court may extend the program placement period for a reasonable period of time to allow such person to complete the applicable program components.\n\n(l) If, upon review of the final progress report submitted by the Court Support Services Division or any other relevant information, the court finds that any person placed in the program has failed to successfully complete any component of the program ordered by the court, is no longer amenable to treatment or is otherwise ineligible to continue participating in the program, the court shall terminate such person's participation in the program. No program fees or substance use treatment costs imposed pursuant to subsection (f) of this section shall be refunded to any person whose participation in the program is terminated. Unless such person requests, and the court grants, reinstatement into the program pursuant to subsection (m) of this section, the court shall order the court file of any person whose participation in the program is terminated to be unsealed, enter a plea of not guilty for such person and immediately place the case on the trial list.\n\n(m) (1) Any person whose participation in the program is terminated may ask the court to reinstate such person into the program up to two times. If a person requests reinstatement into the program, the Court Support Services Division shall verify that such person is eligible for such reinstatement. If a person requesting reinstatement into the program is eligible for reinstatement, the court may grant such person reinstatement into the program. When granting such reinstatement, the court shall order the defendant to participate in an appropriate alcohol education, substance use treatment or victim impact component of the program.\n\n(2) Any person reinstated into the program shall: (A) If ordered to participate in the alcohol education component of the program, pay to the court a nonrefundable program fee of two hundred fifty dollars, which shall be credited to the pretrial account established under section 54-56k , or (B) if ordered to participate in the substance use treatment component of the program, pay the costs of any substance use treatment. The court shall not waive the program fee or the costs of substance use treatment associated with reinstatement into the program unless such person is found eligible to have such fee or cost waived under subdivision (3) of subsection (f) of this section and such person participates in the applicable alcohol education at a service provider located in this state or substance use treatment at a substance use treatment provider licensed by and located in this state.\n\n(n) (1) If any person applies for both the pretrial impaired driving intervention program under the provisions of this section and the pretrial drug intervention and community service program pursuant to section 54-56q , for charges arising from the same arrest, and the Department of Mental Health and Addiction Services, a licensed substance use treatment provider, the Department of Veterans Affairs or the United States Department of Veterans Affairs has already completed the required evaluation and determination of the appropriate drug education or substance use treatment component pursuant to section 54-56q , the court and the Court Support Services Division may rely on such evaluation and determination for the purposes of ordering participation and directing attendance in the alcohol education or substance use treatment component of the program under the provisions of this section. If the court and the division rely on such evaluation and determination, such person shall not be required to pay the evaluation fee under the provisions of subdivision (2) of subsection (b) of this section, provided that such person has paid, or the court has waived, the evaluation fee pursuant to section 54-56q .\n\n(2) If any person is placed in both the pretrial impaired driving intervention program under the provisions of this section and the pretrial drug intervention and community service program pursuant to section 54-56q , for charges arising from the same arrest, the court may find that (A) such person's successful completion of the drug education component of the pretrial drug intervention and community service program pursuant to section 54-56q , satisfies such person's required participation in the alcohol education component of the pretrial impaired driving intervention program under the provisions of this section; or (B) such person's successful completion of the substance use treatment component of the pretrial drug intervention and community service program pursuant to section 54-56q , satisfies such person's required participation in the substance use treatment component of the pretrial impaired driving intervention program under the provisions of this section.\n\n(3) Nothing in this subsection shall relieve any person placed in both the pretrial impaired driving intervention program pursuant to this section and the pretrial drug intervention and community service program pursuant to section 54-56q , for charges arising from the same arrest, from the requirement to participate in the:\n\n(A) Victim impact component of the pretrial impaired driving intervention program, if ordered by the court under the provisions of this section, in order to satisfactorily complete the pretrial impaired driving intervention program; or\n\n(B) Community service component of the pretrial drug intervention and community service program pursuant to section 54-56q , in order to satisfactorily complete the pretrial drug intervention and community service program.\n\n(o) (1) The Court Support Services Division shall retain a record of participation in the pretrial impaired driving intervention program for a period of ten years from the date the court grants the application for, and places the applicant in, the program pursuant to the provisions of this section.\n\n(2) For any person charged with a violation of section 14-227a , 14-227g , 14-227m or 14-227n whose charges were dismissed pursuant to the provisions of this section, the division shall transmit to the Department of Motor Vehicles the record of such person's participation in the program. The Department of Motor Vehicles shall maintain the record of any person's participation in such program as part of such person's driving record for a period of ten years.\n\n(3) For any person charged with a violation of subsection (d) of section 15-133 or section 15-140n whose charges were dismissed pursuant to the provisions of this section, the division shall transmit to the Department of Energy and Environmental Protection the record of such person's participation in the program. The Department of Energy and Environmental Protection shall maintain the record of any person's participation in such program as a part of such person's boater certification record for a period of ten years."

In addition to or in conjunction with any of the conditions enumerated in subparagraphs (A) to (D), inclusive, of this subdivision the court may, when it has reason to believe that the person is drug-dependent and where necessary, reasonable and appropriate, order the person to submit to a urinalysis drug test and to participate in a program of periodic drug testing and treatment. The results of any such drug test shall not be admissible in any criminal proceeding concerning such person.\n\n(2) If the arrested person is charged with no offense other than a misdemeanor, the court shall not impose financial conditions of release on the person unless (A) the person is charged with a family violence crime, as defined in section 46b-38a , or (B) the person requests such financial conditions, or (C) the court makes a finding on the record that there is a likely risk that (i) the arrested person will fail to appear in court, as required, or (ii) the arrested person will obstruct or attempt to obstruct justice, or threaten, injure or intimidate or attempt to threaten, injure or intimidate a prospective witness or juror, or (iii) the arrested person will engage in conduct that threatens the safety of himself or herself or another person. In making a finding described in this subsection, the court may consider past criminal history, including any prior record of failing to appear as required in court that resulted in any conviction for a violation of section 53a-172 or any conviction during the previous ten years for a violation of section 53a-173 and any other pending criminal cases of the person charged with a misdemeanor.\n\n(3) The court may, in determining what conditions of release will reasonably ensure the appearance of the arrested person in court, consider the following factors: (A) The nature and circumstances of the offense, (B) such person's record of previous convictions, (C) such person's past record of appearance in court, (D) such person's family ties, (E) such person's employment record, (F) such person's financial resources, character and mental condition, (G) such person's community ties, and (H) in the case of a violation of section 53a-222a when the condition of release was issued for a family violence crime, as defined in section 46b-38a , the heightened risk posed to victims of family violence by violations of conditions of release.\n\n(b) (1) Except as provided in subsection (c) of this section, any arrested person charged with the commission of a class A felony, a class B felony, except a violation of section 53a-86 or 53a-122 , a class C felony, except a violation of section 53a-87 , 53a-152 or 53a-153 , or a class D felony under sections 53a-60 to 53a-60c , inclusive, section 53a-72a , 53a-95 , 53a-103 , 53a-103a , 53a-114 , 53a-136 or 53a-216 , or a family violence crime, as defined in section 46b-38a , is presented before the Superior Court, said court shall, in bailable offenses, promptly order the release of such person upon the first of the following conditions of release found sufficient to reasonably ensure the appearance of the arrested person in court and that the safety of any other person will not be endangered: (A) Upon such person's execution of a written promise to appear without special conditions, (B) upon such person's execution of a written promise to appear with nonfinancial conditions, (C) upon such person's execution of a bond without surety in no greater amount than necessary, or (D) upon such person's execution of a bond with surety in no greater amount than necessary, but in no event shall a judge prohibit a bond from being posted by surety. In addition to or in conjunction with any of the conditions enumerated in subparagraphs (A) to (D), inclusive, of this subdivision, the court may, when it has reason to believe that the person is drug-dependent and where necessary, reasonable and appropriate, order the person to submit to a urinalysis drug test and to participate in a program of periodic drug testing and treatment. The results of any such drug test shall not be admissible in any criminal proceeding concerning such person.\n\n(2) The court may, in determining what conditions of release will reasonably ensure the appearance of the arrested person in court and that the safety of any other person will not be endangered, consider the following factors: (A) The nature and circumstances of the offense, (B) such person's record of previous convictions, (C) such person's past record of appearance in court after being admitted to bail, (D) such person's family ties, (E) such person's employment record, (F) such person's financial resources, character and mental condition, (G) such person's community ties, (H) the number and seriousness of charges pending against the arrested person, (I) the weight of the evidence against the arrested person, (J) the arrested person's history of violence, (K) whether the arrested person has previously been convicted of similar offenses while released on bond, (L) the likelihood based upon the expressed intention of the arrested person that such person will commit another crime while released, and (M) the heightened risk posed to victims of family violence by violations of conditions of release and court orders of protection.\n\n(3) When imposing conditions of release under this subsection, the court shall state for the record any factors under subdivision (2) of this subsection that it considered and the findings that it made as to the danger, if any, that the arrested person might pose to the safety of any other person upon the arrested person's release that caused the court to impose the specific conditions of release that it imposed.\n\n(c) (1) When any arrested person charged with the commission of a serious firearm offense, as defined in section 53a-3 , is (A) a serious firearm offender, (B) has two previous convictions for a violation of section 29-36 , 29-36a , 53-202 , 53-202a , 53-202b , 53-202c , 53-202w , 53-202aa , 53-206i , 53a-54a , 53a-54b , 53a-54c , 53a-54d , 53a-55 , 53a-55a , 53a-56 , 53a-56a , 53a-59 , 53a-60 , 53a-60a , 53a-134 , 53a-212 , 53a-216 , 53a-217 , 53a-217b or 53a-217c , (C) a previous conviction for a violation of section 29-35 , in addition to a prior conviction for a violation of section 29-36 , 29-36a , 53-202 , 53-202a , 53-202b , 53-202c , 53-202w , 53-202aa , 53-206i , 53a-54a , 53a-54b , 53a-54c , 53a-54d , 53a-55 , 53a-55a , 53a-56 , 53a-56a , 53a-59 , 53a-60 , 53a-60a , 53a-134 , 53a-212 , 53a-216 , 53a-217 , 53a-217b or 53a-217c , or (D) two or more convictions during the five-year period immediately prior to the current arrest for a violation of section 21a-277 , 21a-278 , 53a-122 or 53a-123 , is presented before the Superior Court, the court shall, in bailable offenses, promptly order the release of such person after establishing a bond amount found sufficient to reasonably ensure the appearance of the arrested person in court, and that the safety of any other person will not be endangered and upon such person's execution of a bond with or without surety in no greater amount than necessary. The prosecutorial official shall petition for the arrested person to deposit at least thirty per cent of the bond amount directly with the court, and there shall be a rebuttable presumption that the safety of other persons will be endangered without the granting of such petition. Additionally, the court may, when it has reason to believe that the person is drug-dependent and where necessary, reasonable and appropriate, order the person to submit to a urinalysis drug test and to participate in a program of periodic drug testing and treatment. The results of any such drug test shall not be admissible in any criminal proceeding concerning such person.\n\n(2) When any arrested person charged with the commission of a serious firearm offense, as defined in section 53a-3 , other than a person described in subdivision (1) of this subsection, is presented before the Superior Court, the court shall, in bailable offenses, promptly order the release of such person upon the first of the following conditions of release found sufficient to reasonably ensure the appearance of the arrested person in court and that the safety of any other person will not be endangered: (A) Upon such person's execution of a written promise to appear without special conditions, (B) upon such person's execution of a written promise to appear with nonfinancial conditions, (C) upon such person's execution of a bond without surety in no greater amount than necessary, or (D) upon such person's execution of a bond with surety in no greater amount than necessary, but in no event shall a judge prohibit a bond from being posted by surety. The prosecutorial official may petition the court to deem such person a serious risk to the safety of another person or persons. The prosecutorial official may present any information developed by federal, state and local law enforcement agencies in the course of a criminal investigation or enforcement action, including, but not limited to, social media posts, pictures or videos threatening violence, claiming responsibility for violence or suggesting possession of a firearm. If the court finds that the arrested person poses a serious risk to the safety of another person or persons, the arrested person may only be released pursuant to subparagraph (C) or (D) of this subdivision and the arrested person shall be required to deposit at least thirty per cent of any bond amount directly with the court. Additionally, the court may, when it has reason to believe that the person is drug-dependent and where necessary, reasonable and appropriate, order the person to submit to a urinalysis drug test and to participate in a program of periodic drug testing and treatment. The results of any such drug test shall not be admissible in any criminal proceeding concerning such person.\n\n(3) The court may, in determining what conditions of release will reasonably ensure the appearance of the arrested person in court and that the safety of any other person will not be endangered, consider the following factors: (A) The nature and circumstances of the offense, (B) such person's record of previous convictions, (C) such person's past record of appearances in court after being admitted to bail, (D) such person's family ties, (E) such person's employment record, (F) such person's financial resources, character and mental condition, (G) such person's community ties, (H) the number and seriousness of charges pending against the arrested person, (I) the weight of the evidence against the arrested person, (J) the arrested person's history of violence, (K) whether the arrested person has previously been convicted of similar offenses while released on bond, and (L) the likelihood based upon the expressed intention of the arrested person that such person will commit another crime while released.\n\n(4) When imposing conditions of release under this subsection, the court shall state for the record any factors under subdivision (3) of this subsection that it considered and the findings that it made as to the danger, if any, that the arrested person might pose to the safety of any other person upon the arrested person's release that caused the court to impose the specific conditions of release that the court imposed.\n\n(d) If the court determines that a nonfinancial condition of release should be imposed pursuant to subparagraph (B) of subdivision (1) of subsection (a) or (b) of this section, the court shall order the pretrial release of the person subject to the least restrictive condition or combination of conditions that the court determines will reasonably ensure the appearance of the arrested person in court and, with respect to the release of the person pursuant to subsection (b) or (c) of this section, that the safety of any other person will not be endangered, which conditions may include an order that the arrested person do one or more of the following: (1) Remain under the supervision of a designated person or organization; (2) comply with specified restrictions on such person's travel, association or place of abode; (3) not engage in specified activities, including the use or possession of a dangerous weapon, an intoxicant or a controlled substance; (4) provide sureties of the peace pursuant to section 54-56f under supervision of a designated bail commissioner or intake, assessment and referral specialist employed by the Judicial Branch; (5) avoid all contact with an alleged victim of the crime and with a potential witness who may testify concerning the offense; (6) maintain employment or, if unemployed, actively seek employment; (7) maintain or commence an educational program; (8) be subject to electronic monitoring; or (9) satisfy any other condition that is reasonably necessary to ensure the appearance of the person in court and that the safety of any other person will not be endangered. The court shall state on the record its reasons for imposing any such nonfinancial condition.\n\n(e) If the arrested person is not released, the court shall order him committed to the custody of the Commissioner of Correction until he is released or discharged in due course of law.\n\n(f) The court may require that the person subject to electronic monitoring pursuant to subsection (d) of this section pay directly to the electronic monitoring service provider a fee for the cost of such electronic monitoring services. If the court finds that the person subject to electronic monitoring is indigent and unable to pay the costs of electronic monitoring services, the court shall waive such costs. Any contract entered into by the Judicial Branch and the electronic monitoring service provider shall include a provision stating that the total cost for electronic monitoring services shall not exceed five dollars per day. Such amount shall be indexed annually to reflect the rate of inflation.\n\nSee Sec. 18-100f re release by Commissioner of Correction.\n\nSee Secs. 53a-222, 53a-222a re criminal penalties for violation of certain conditions of release."

If such certificate recommends that the witness be taken into immediate custody and delivered to an officer of the requesting state to assure the attendance of the witness in such state, such judge may, in lieu of notification of the hearing, direct that such witness be forthwith brought before such judge for such hearing, and, being satisfied, at such hearing, of the desirability of such custody and delivery, of which desirability such certificate shall be prima facie proof, may, in lieu of issuing a subpoena or summons, order that such witness be forthwith taken into custody and delivered to an officer of the requesting state. If such witness, after being paid or tendered by an authorized person the same amount per mile as provided for state employees pursuant to section 5-141c for each mile by the ordinary traveled route to and from the court where the prosecution is pending and five dollars each day that such witness is required to travel and attend as a witness, fails, without good cause, to attend and testify as directed in the summons, the witness shall be punished in the manner provided for the punishment of any witness who disobeys a summons issued from a court of record in this state.",

If a person in any state, which by its laws has made provision for commanding persons within its borders to attend and testify in criminal prosecutions or in grand jury investigations commenced or about to commence in this state, is a material witness in a prosecution pending in a court of record in this state, or in a grand jury investigation which has commenced or is about to commence, a judge of such court may issue a certificate under the seal of the court, stating such facts and specifying the number of days the witness will be required. Such certificate may include a recommendation that the witness be taken into immediate custody and delivered to an officer of this state to assure the attendance of the witness in this state. Such certificate shall be presented to a judge of a court of record in the judicial district in which the witness is found. If the witness is summoned to attend and testify in this state, the witness shall be tendered the same amount per mile as provided for state employees pursuant to section 5-141c for each mile by the ordinary traveled route to and from the court where the prosecution is pending, and five dollars for each day that such witness is required to travel and attend as a witness. A witness who has appeared in accordance with the provisions of the summons shall not be required to remain within this state a longer period of time than the period mentioned in the certificate, unless otherwise ordered by the court. If such witness, after coming into this state, fails, without good cause, to attend and testify as directed in the summons, the witness shall be punished in the manner provided for the punishment of any witness who disobeys a summons issued from a court of record in this state.",

Since trial court's instruction to jury not to draw any unfavorable inference from the fact that defendant did not testify given in the context of instructions concerning how jury was to find facts in general did not clearly inform jury that it could not use defendant's silence as a factor in its verdict and did not satisfy the statutory requirement that court convey a specific instruction to jury that no unfavorable inference could be drawn from the fact that defendant did not testify, and state failed to establish that the deficient instruction was clarified or remedied by the court and failed to demonstrate harmlessness of the constitutional violation beyond a reasonable doubt, judgment was reversed and the case remanded for new trial. 97 CA 266. Where lower court had inquired about specific instruction re failure to testify and court and defense counsel discussed instruction, such discussion constituted a request for a no unfavorable inference instruction; reiterated previous holding that provisions are not required to be waived personally by defendant but can be waived by defense counsel. 109 CA 679."

            "text": "(a) In any criminal prosecution of an offense involving assault, sexual assault or abuse of a child twelve years of age or younger, the court may, upon motion of the attorney for any party, order that the testimony of the child be taken in a room other than the courtroom in the presence and under the supervision of the trial judge hearing the matter and be televised by closed circuit equipment in the courtroom or recorded for later showing before the court. Only the judge, the defendant, the attorneys for the defendant and for the state, persons necessary to operate the equipment and any person who would contribute to the welfare and well-being of the child may be present in the room with the child during his testimony, except that the court may order the defendant excluded from the room or screened from the sight and hearing of the child only if the state proves, by clear and convincing evidence, that the child would be so intimidated, or otherwise inhibited, by the physical presence of the defendant that a compelling need exists to take the testimony of the child outside the physical presence of the defendant in order to insure the reliability of such testimony. If the defendant is excluded from the room or screened from the sight and hearing of the child, the court shall ensure that the defendant is able to observe and hear the testimony of the child, but that the child cannot see or hear the defendant. The defendant shall be able to consult privately with his attorney at all times during the taking of the testimony. The attorneys and the judge may question the child. If the court orders the testimony of a child to be taken under this subsection, the child shall not be required to testify in court at the proceeding for which the testimony was taken.\n\n(b) In any criminal prosecution of an offense involving assault, sexual assault or abuse of a child twelve years of age or younger, the court may, upon motion of the attorney for any party, order that the following procedures be used when the testimony of the child is taken: (1) Persons shall be prohibited from entering and leaving the courtroom during the child's testimony; (2) an adult who is known to the child and with whom the child feels comfortable shall be permitted to sit in close proximity to the child during the child's testimony, provided such person shall not obscure the child from the view of the defendant or the trier of fact; (3) the use of anatomically correct dolls by the child shall be permitted; and (4) the attorneys for the defendant and for the state shall question the child while seated at a table positioned in front of the child, shall remain seated while posing objections and shall ask questions and pose objections in a manner which is not intimidating to the child."

In lieu of such appearance, the victim may submit a written statement or, if the victim of the crime is deceased, the legal representative or a member of the immediate family of such deceased victim may submit a statement of such deceased victim to the state's attorney, assistant state's attorney or deputy assistant state's attorney in charge of the case. Such state's attorney, assistant state's attorney or deputy assistant state's attorney shall file the statement with the sentencing court and the statement shall be made a part of the record at the sentencing hearing. Any such statement, whether oral or written, shall relate to the facts of the case, the appropriateness of any penalty and the extent of any injuries, financial losses and loss of earnings directly resulting from the crime for which the defendant is being sentenced. The court shall inquire on the record whether any victim is present for the purpose of making an oral statement or has submitted a written statement. If no victim is present and no such written statement has been submitted, the court shall inquire on the record whether an attempt has been made to notify any such victim as provided in subdivision (1) of subsection (c) of this section or, if the defendant was originally charged with a violation of section 53a-167c for assaulting a peace officer, whether the peace officer has been personally notified as provided in subdivision (2) of subsection (c) of this section. After consideration of any such statements, the court may refuse to accept, where appropriate, a negotiated plea or sentence, and the court shall give the defendant an opportunity to enter a new plea and to elect trial by jury or by the court.\n\n(c) (1) Except as provided in subdivision (2) of this subsection, prior to the imposition of sentence upon such defendant and prior to the acceptance of a plea pursuant to a plea agreement, the state's attorney, assistant state's attorney or deputy assistant state's attorney in charge of the case shall notify the victim of such crime of the date, time and place of the original sentencing hearing or any judicial proceeding concerning the acceptance of a plea pursuant to a plea agreement, provided the victim has informed such state's attorney, assistant state's attorney or deputy assistant state's attorney that such victim wishes to make or submit a statement as provided in subsection (b) of this section and has complied with a request from such state's attorney, assistant state's attorney or deputy assistant state's attorney to submit a stamped, self-addressed postcard for the purpose of such notification.\n\n(2) Prior to the imposition of sentence upon a defendant originally charged with a violation of section 53a-167c for assaulting a peace officer, and prior to the acceptance of a plea pursuant to a plea agreement, the state's attorney, assistant state's attorney or deputy assistant state's attorney in charge of the case shall personally notify the peace officer who was the victim of such crime of the date, time and place of the original sentencing hearing or any judicial proceeding concerning the acceptance of a plea pursuant to a plea agreement.\n\n(3) If the state's attorney, assistant state's attorney or deputy assistant state's attorney is unable to notify the victim, such state's attorney, assistant state's attorney or deputy state's attorney shall sign a statement as to such notification.\n\n(d) Upon the request of a victim, prior to the acceptance by the court of a plea of a defendant pursuant to a proposed plea agreement, the state's attorney, assistant state's attorney or deputy assistant state's attorney in charge of the case shall provide such victim with the terms of such proposed plea agreement in writing.

No appeal may be taken from a judgment denying a petition for a new trial unless, within ten days after the judgment is rendered, the judge who heard the case or a judge of the Supreme Court or the Appellate Court, as the case may be, certifies that a question is involved in the decision which ought to be reviewed by the Supreme Court or by the Appellate Court. It shall be sufficient service of any such writ of error or petition for a new trial to serve it upon the state's attorney for the judicial district where it is brought.",

Such order shall be accompanied by a written statement of the judge's reasons for denying the stay of execution. The order and the statement shall become a part of the files and record of the case. If any defendant has been admitted to bail following an oral or written notice of intent to appeal or petition for a new trial and such defendant has failed, within twenty days after the judgment from which the appeal is to be taken, or such further period as the court may grant, to perfect the appeal or petition, a mittimus for his arrest shall issue. If any defendant is imprisoned after sentencing and before he is admitted to bail, such period of imprisonment shall be counted toward satisfaction of his sentence. If any defendant is admitted to bail and subsequently surrendered and remitted to custody while his appeal is pending, the period of imprisonment following thereafter shall be counted toward satisfaction of his sentence.",

No appellate procedure shall be deemed to have terminated until the end of the period allowed by law for the filing of a motion for reargument, or, if such motion is filed, until the proceedings consequent thereon are finally determined. When execution is stayed under the provisions of this section, the clerk of the court shall forthwith give notice thereof to the warden of the institution in which such defendant is in custody. If the original judgment of conviction has been affirmed or remains in full force at the time when the clerk has received the notification of the termination of any proceedings by appeal, writ of certiorari, writ of error or petition for a new trial, and the day designated for the infliction of the death penalty has then passed or will pass within thirty days thereafter, the defendant shall, within said period of thirty days, upon an order of the court in which the judgment was rendered at a regular or special criminal session thereof, be presented before said court by the warden of the institution in which the defendant is in custody or his deputy, and the court, with the judge assigned to hold the session presiding, shall thereupon designate a day for the infliction of the death penalty and the clerk of the court shall issue a warrant of execution, reciting therein the original judgment, the fact of the stay of execution and the final order of the court, which warrant shall be forthwith served upon the warden or his deputy.",

No appeal may be taken from a judgment denying a petition for a new trial unless, within ten days after the judgment is rendered, the judge who heard the case or a judge of the Supreme Court or the Appellate Court, as the case may be, certifies that a question is involved in the decision which ought to be reviewed by the Supreme Court or by the Appellate Court. It shall be sufficient service of any such writ of error or petition for a new trial to serve it upon the state's attorney for the judicial district where it is brought.\n\n(b) When such defendant is convicted and sentenced to a term of imprisonment and, within two weeks after final judgment, files with the clerk of the court wherein the conviction was had an appeal to the Supreme Court or gives oral or written notice of his intention to appeal to said court or to petition for a new trial, the appeal or the notice shall operate as a stay of execution pending the final determination of the case, provided the defendant is admitted to bail, except the appeal or the notice shall not operate as a stay of execution, if within five days after the filing of the appeal or notice thereof, the judge before whom the criminal prosecution was tried directs in writing that the appeal or the notice shall not operate as a stay of execution. Such order shall be accompanied by a written statement of the judge's reasons for denying the stay of execution. The order and the statement shall become a part of the files and record of the case. If any defendant has been admitted to bail following an oral or written notice of intent to appeal or petition for a new trial and such defendant has failed, within twenty days after the judgment from which the appeal is to be taken, or such further period as the court may grant, to perfect the appeal or petition, a mittimus for his arrest shall issue. If any defendant is imprisoned after sentencing and before he is admitted to bail, such period of imprisonment shall be counted toward satisfaction of his sentence. If any defendant is admitted to bail and subsequently surrendered and remitted to custody while his appeal is pending, the period of imprisonment following thereafter shall be counted toward satisfaction of his sentence.\n\n(c) In any criminal prosecution in which the defendant has been sentenced to death and has taken an appeal to the Supreme Court of this state or the Supreme Court of the United States or brought a writ of error, writ of certiorari or petition for a new trial, the taking of the appeal, the making of the application for a writ of certiorari or the return into court of the writ of error or petition for a new trial shall, unless, upon application by the state's attorney and after hearing, the Supreme Court otherwise orders, stay the execution of the death penalty until the clerk of the court where the trial was had has received notification of the termination of any such proceeding by decision or otherwise, and for thirty days thereafter. No appellate procedure shall be deemed to have terminated until the end of the period allowed by law for the filing of a motion for reargument, or, if such motion is filed, until the proceedings consequent thereon are finally determined. When execution is stayed under the provisions of this section, the clerk of the court shall forthwith give notice thereof to the warden of the institution in which such defendant is in custody. If the original judgment of conviction has been affirmed or remains in full force at the time when the clerk has received the notification of the termination of any proceedings by appeal, writ of certiorari, writ of error or petition for a new trial, and the day designated for the infliction of the death penalty has then passed or will pass within thirty days thereafter, the defendant shall, within said period of thirty days, upon an order of the court in which the judgment was rendered at a regular or special criminal session thereof, be presented before said court by the warden of the institution in which the defendant is in custody or his deputy, and the court, with the judge assigned to hold the session presiding, shall thereupon designate a day for the infliction of the death penalty and the clerk of the court shall issue a warrant of execution, reciting therein the original judgment, the fact of the stay of execution and the final order of the court, which warrant shall be forthwith served upon the warden or his deputy.\n\nSee Sec. 52-582 re time limit for bringing petitions for new trial."

Where there was sufficient basis in the evidence to support court's finding on a motion to suppress and there had been a full evidentiary hearing on such motion, the record was such that there was no clear, arbitrary and extreme abuse of discretion such that an injustice appears to have been done and, therefore, trial court's denial of state's request for permission to appeal was not an abuse of discretion. 64 CA 495.

The committee shall consider applications from three categories of news media: (1) Newspapers, broadcasters and news services regularly reporting general news of the state; (2) newspapers and broadcasters nearest the locality where the crime was committed; and (3) newspapers and broadcasters that regularly cover the correctional institutions deemed appropriate by the commissioner as a location for the infliction of the death penalty. The committee shall select applicants from each category unless a category lacks a qualified applicant. The committee shall promptly inform the commissioner of its recommendations and inform the news media recommended to be witnesses. For any execution, the commissioner shall specify the number of news media witnesses that space and security requirements permit. The commissioner shall promptly inform the committee if any applicant it has recommended to be a witness is to be excluded for specified reasons of security."

Change to subsection removing potential of using earned risk reduction credits to advance the date petitioner could be eligible for parole does not violate the constitutional ex post facto prohibition since it has no bearing on the punishment petitioner's criminal conduct exposed him to. 177 CA 71."

ensure an opportunity for input and timely notice to victims and to jurisdictions where defined offenders are authorized to travel or to relocate across state lines; establish a system of uniform data collection, access to information on active cases by authorized criminal justice officials and regular reporting of compact activities to heads of state councils, state executive, judicial and legislative branches and criminal justice administrators; monitor compliance with rules governing interstate movement of offenders and initiate interventions to address and correct noncompliance; and coordinate training and education regarding regulation of interstate movement of offenders for officials involved in such activity.\n\nThe compacting states recognize that there is no right of any offender to live in another state and that duly accredited officers of a sending state may at all times enter a receiving state and there apprehend and retake any offender under supervision subject to the provisions of this compact and bylaws and rules promulgated hereunder.\n\nIt is the policy of the compacting states that the activities conducted by the Interstate Commission created herein are the formation of public policies and are therefore public business.\n\nARTICLE II\n\nDEFINITIONS\n\nAs used in this compact, unless the context clearly requires a different construction:\n\nA. “Adult” means both individuals legally classified as adults and juveniles treated as adults by court order, statute or operation of law.\n\nB. “Bylaws” means those bylaws established by the Interstate Commission for its governance or for directing or controlling the Interstate Commission's actions or conduct.\n\nC. “Compact administrator” means the individual in each compacting state appointed pursuant to the terms of this compact responsible for the administration and management of the state's supervision and transfer of offenders subject to the terms of this compact, the rules adopted by the Interstate Commission and policies adopted by the state council under this compact.\n\nD. “Compacting state” means any state which has enacted the enabling legislation for this compact.\n\nE. “Commissioner” means the voting representative of each compacting state appointed pursuant to Article III of this compact.\n\nF. “Interstate Commission” means the Interstate Commission for Adult Offender Supervision established by this compact.\n\nG. “Member” means the commissioner of a compacting state or designee, who shall be a person officially connected with the commissioner.\n\nH. “Noncompacting state” means any state which has not enacted the enabling legislation for this compact.\n\nI. “Offender” means an adult placed under, or subject to, supervision as the result of the commission of a criminal offense and released to the community under the jurisdiction of courts, paroling authorities, corrections or other criminal justice agencies.\n\nJ. “Person” means any individual, corporation, business enterprise, or other legal entity, either public or private.\n\nK. “Rules” means acts of the Interstate Commission, duly promulgated pursuant to Article VII of this compact, substantially affecting interested parties in addition to the Interstate Commission, which shall have the force and effect of law in the compacting states.\n\nL. “State” means a state of the United States, the District of Columbia and any other territorial possession of the United States.\n\nM. “State Council” means the resident members of the State Council for Interstate Adult Offender Supervision created by each state under Article III of this compact.\n\nARTICLE III\n\nTHE COMPACT COMMISSION\n\nA.

Enforcement\n\nThe Interstate Commission, in the reasonable exercise of its discretion, shall enforce the provisions of this compact using any or all means set forth in Article XI, Section B, of this compact.\n\nARTICLE IX\n\nFINANCE\n\n1. The Interstate Commission shall pay or provide for the payment of the reasonable expenses of its establishment, organization and ongoing activities.\n\n2. The Interstate Commission shall levy on and collect an annual assessment from each compacting state to cover the cost of the internal operations and activities of the Interstate Commission and its staff which must be in a total amount sufficient to cover the Interstate Commission's annual budget as approved each year. The aggregate annual assessment amount shall be allocated based upon a formula to be determined by the Interstate Commission, taking into consideration the population of the state and the volume of interstate movement of offenders in each compacting state and shall promulgate a rule binding upon all compacting states which governs said assessment.\n\n3. The Interstate Commission shall not incur any obligations of any kind prior to securing the funds adequate to meet the same; nor shall the Interstate Commission pledge the credit of any of the compacting states, except by and with the authority of the compacting state.\n\n4. The Interstate Commission shall keep accurate accounts of all receipts and disbursements. The receipts and disbursements of the Interstate Commission shall be subject to the audit and accounting procedures established under its bylaws. However, all receipts and disbursements of funds handled by the Interstate Commission shall be audited yearly by a certified or licensed public accountant and the report of the audit shall be included in and become part of the annual report of the Interstate Commission.\n\nARTICLE X\n\nCOMPACTING STATES, EFFECTIVE DATE AND AMENDMENT\n\n1. Any state, as defined in Article II of this compact, is eligible to become a compacting state.\n\n2. The compact shall become effective and binding upon legislative enactment of the compact into law by no less than thirty-five of the states. The initial effective date shall be the later of July 1, 2001, or upon enactment into law by the thirty-fifth jurisdiction. Thereafter it shall become effective and binding, as to any other compacting state, upon enactment of the compact into law by that state. The governors of nonmember states or their designees will be invited to participate in Interstate Commission activities on a nonvoting basis prior to adoption of the compact by all states and territories of the United States.\n\n3. Amendments to the compact may be proposed by the Interstate Commission for enactment by the compacting states. No amendment shall become effective and binding upon the Interstate Commission and the compacting states unless and until it is enacted into law by unanimous consent of the compacting states.\n\nARTICLE XI\n\nWITHDRAWAL, DEFAULT, TERMINATION AND JUDICIAL ENFORCEMENT\n\nSection A. Withdrawal\n\n1. Once effective, the compact shall continue in force and remain binding upon each and every compacting state; provided, that a compacting state may withdraw from the compact (“withdrawing state”) by enacting a statute specifically repealing the statute which enacted the compact into law.\n\n2. The effective date of withdrawal is the effective date of the repeal.\n\n3. The withdrawing state shall immediately notify the chairperson of the Interstate Commission in writing upon the introduction of legislation repealing this compact in the withdrawing state.\n\n4. The Interstate Commission shall notify the other compacting states of the withdrawing state's intent to withdraw within sixty days of its receipt thereof.\n\n5. The withdrawing state is responsible for all assessments, obligations and liabilities incurred through the effective date of withdrawal, including any obligations, the performance of which extend beyond the effective date of withdrawal.\n\n6. Reinstatement following withdrawal of any compacting state shall occur upon the withdrawing state reenacting the compact or upon such later date as determined by the Interstate Commission.\n\nSection B. Default\n\n1. If the Interstate Commission determines that any compacting state has at any time defaulted (“defaulting state”) in the performance of any of its obligations or responsibilities under this compact, the bylaws or any duly promulgated rules, the Interstate Commission may impose any or all of the following penalties:\n\na. Fines, fees and costs in such amounts as are deemed to be reasonable as fixed by the Interstate Commission;\n\nb. Remedial training and technical assistance as directed by the Interstate Commission;\n\nc. Suspension and termination of membership in the compact. Suspension shall be imposed only after all other reasonable means of securing compliance under the bylaws and rules have been exhausted. Immediate notice of suspension shall be given by the Interstate Commission to the Governor, the Chief Justice or chief judicial officer of the state; the majority and minority leaders of the defaulting state's legislature, and the State Council. The grounds for default include, but are not limited to, failure of a compacting state to perform such obligations or responsibilities imposed upon it by this compact, Interstate Commission bylaws, or duly promulgated rules. The Interstate Commission shall immediately notify the defaulting state in writing of the penalty imposed by the Interstate Commission on the defaulting state pending a cure of the default. The Interstate Commission shall stipulate the conditions and the time period within which the defaulting state must cure its default. If the defaulting state fails to cure the default within the time period specified by the Interstate Commission, in addition to any other penalties imposed herein, the defaulting state may be terminated from the compact upon an affirmative vote of a majority of the compacting states and all rights, privileges and benefits conferred by this compact shall be terminated from the effective date of suspension.\n\n2. Within sixty days of the effective date of termination of a defaulting state, the Interstate Commission shall notify the Governor, the Chief Justice or chief judicial officer and the majority and minority leaders of the defaulting state's legislature and the State Council of such termination.\n\n3. The defaulting state is responsible for all assessments, obligations and liabilities incurred through the effective date of termination including any obligations, the performance of which extends beyond the effective date of termination.\n\n4. The Interstate Commission shall not bear any costs relating to the defaulting state unless otherwise mutually agreed upon between the Interstate Commission and the defaulting state.\n\n5. Reinstatement following termination of any compacting state requires both a reenactment of the compact by the defaulting state and the approval of the Interstate Commission pursuant to the rules.\n\nSection C. Judicial enforcement\n\nThe Interstate Commission may, by majority vote of the members, initiate legal action in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia or, at the discretion of the Interstate Commission, in the federal district where the Interstate Commission has its offices to enforce compliance with the provisions of the compact, its duly promulgated rules and bylaws, against any compacting state in default. In the event judicial enforcement is necessary the prevailing party shall be awarded all costs of such litigation including reasonable attorneys' fees.\n\nSection D. Dissolution of compact\n\n1. The compact dissolves effective upon the date of the withdrawal or default of the compacting state which reduces membership in the compact to one compacting state.\n\n2. Upon the dissolution of this compact, the compact becomes null and void and shall be of no further force or effect, and the business and affairs of the Interstate Commission shall be wound up and any surplus funds shall be distributed in accordance with the bylaws.\n\nARTICLE XII\n\nSEVERABILITY AND CONSTRUCTION\n\n1. The provisions of this compact shall be severable, and if any phrase, clause, sentence or provision is deemed unenforceable, the remaining provisions of the compact shall be enforceable.\n\n2. The provisions of this compact shall be liberally construed to effectuate its purposes.\n\nARTICLE XIII\n\nBINDING EFFECT OF COMPACT AND OTHER LAWS\n\nSection A. Other laws\n\n1. Nothing herein prevents the enforcement of any other law of a compacting state that is not inconsistent with this compact.\n\n2. All compacting states' laws conflicting with this compact are superseded to the extent of the conflict.\n\nSection B. Binding effect of the compact\n\n1. All lawful actions of the Interstate Commission, including all rules and bylaws promulgated by the Interstate Commission, are binding upon the compacting states.\n\n2. All agreements between the Interstate Commission and the compacting states are binding in accordance with their terms.\n\n3. Upon the request of a party to a conflict over meaning or interpretation of Interstate Commission actions, and upon a majority vote of the compacting states, the Interstate Commission may issue advisory opinions regarding such meaning or interpretation.\n\n4. In the event any provision of this compact exceeds the constitutional limits imposed on the legislature of any compacting state, the obligations, duties, powers or jurisdiction sought to be conferred by such provision upon the Interstate Commission shall be ineffective and such obligations, duties, powers or jurisdiction shall remain in the compacting state and shall be exercised by the agency thereof to which such obligations, duties, powers or jurisdiction are delegated by law in effect at the time this compact becomes effective.\n\nSee Sec. 54-76b re youthful offenders."

Accordingly, it is the policy of the party states and the purpose of this agreement to encourage the expeditious and orderly disposition of such charges and determination of the proper status of any and all detainers based on untried indictments, informations or complaints. The party states also find that proceedings with reference to such charges and detainers, when emanating from another jurisdiction, cannot properly be had in the absence of cooperative procedures. It is the further purpose of this agreement to provide such cooperative procedures.",

              "(d) Any request for final disposition made by a prisoner pursuant to paragraph (a) hereof shall operate as a request for final disposition of all untried indictments, informations or complaints on the basis of which detainers have been lodged against the prisoner from the state to whose prosecuting official the request for final disposition is specifically directed. The warden, commissioner of correction or other official having custody of the prisoner shall forthwith notify all appropriate prosecuting officers and courts in the several jurisdictions within the state to which the prisoner's request for final disposition is being sent of the proceeding being initiated by the prisoner. Any notification sent pursuant to this paragraph shall be accompanied by copies of the prisoner's written notice, request, and the certificate. If trial is not had on any indictment, information or complaint contemplated hereby prior to the return of the prisoner to the original place of imprisonment, such indictment, information or complaint shall not be of any further force or effect, and the court shall enter an order dismissing the same with prejudice.",
              "(e) Any request for final disposition made by a prisoner pursuant to paragraph (a) hereof shall also be deemed to be a waiver of extradition with respect to any charge or proceeding contemplated thereby or included therein by reason of paragraph (d) hereof, and a waiver of extradition to the receiving state to serve any sentence there imposed upon him, after completion of his term of imprisonment in the sending state. The request for final disposition shall also constitute a consent by the prisoner to the production of his body in any court where his presence may be required in order to effectuate the purposes of this agreement and a further consent voluntarily to be returned to the original place of imprisonment in accordance with the provisions of this agreement. Nothing in this paragraph shall prevent the imposition of a concurrent sentence if otherwise permitted by law.",

              "(b) Upon receipt of the officer's written request as provided in paragraph (a) hereof, the appropriate authorities having the prisoner in custody shall furnish the officer with a certificate stating the term of commitment under which the prisoner is being held, the time already served, the time remaining to be served on the sentence, the amount of good time earned, the time of parole eligibility of the prisoner, and any decisions of the state parole agency relating to the prisoner. Said authorities simultaneously shall furnish all other officers and appropriate courts in the receiving state who have lodged detainers against the prisoner with similar certificates and with notices informing them of the request for custody or availability and of the reasons therefor.",

              "(d) Nothing contained in this article shall be construed to deprive any prisoner of any right which he may have to contest the legality of his delivery as provided in paragraph (a) hereof, but such delivery may not be opposed or denied on the ground that the executive authority of the sending state has not affirmatively consented to or ordered such delivery.",
              "(e) If trial is not had on any indictment, information or complaint contemplated hereby prior to the prisoner's being returned to the original place of imprisonment pursuant to article V(e) hereof, such indictment, information or complaint shall not be of any further force or effect, and the court shall enter an order dismissing the same with prejudice.",

If the request for final disposition is made by the prisoner, the offer of temporary custody shall accompany the written notice provided for in article III of this agreement. In the case of a federal prisoner, the appropriate authority in the receiving state shall be entitled to temporary custody as provided by this agreement or to the prisoner's presence in federal custody at the place for trial, whichever custodial arrangement may be approved by the custodian.",
              "(b) The officer or other representative of a state accepting an offer of temporary custody shall present the following upon demand: (1) Proper identification and evidence of his authority to act for the state into whose temporary custody the prisoner is to be given. (2) A duly certified copy of the indictment, information or complaint on the basis of which the detainer has been lodged and on the basis of which the request for temporary custody of the prisoner has been made.",
              "(c) If the appropriate authority shall refuse or fail to accept temporary custody of said person, or in the event that an action on the indictment, information or complaint on the basis of which the detainer has been lodged is not brought to trial within the period provided in article III or article IV hereof, the appropriate court of the jurisdiction where the indictment, information or complaint has been pending shall enter an order dismissing the same with prejudice, and any detainer based thereon shall cease to be of any force or effect.",
              "(d) The temporary custody referred to in this agreement shall be only for the purpose of permitting prosecution on the charge or charges contained in one or more untried indictments, informations or complaints which form the basis of the detainer or detainers or for prosecution on any other charge or charges arising out of the same transaction. Except for his attendance at court and while being transported to or from any place at which his presence may be required, the prisoner shall be held in a suitable jail or other facility regularly used for persons awaiting prosecution.",
              "(e) At the earliest practicable time consonant with the purposes of this agreement, the prisoner shall be returned to the sending state.",
              "(f) During the continuance of temporary custody or while the prisoner is otherwise being made available for trial as required by this agreement, time being served on the sentence shall continue to run but good time shall be earned by the prisoner only if, and to the extent that, the law and practice of the jurisdiction which imposed the sentence may allow.",
              "(g) For all purposes other than that for which temporary custody as provided in this agreement is exercised, the prisoner shall be deemed to remain in the custody of and subject to the jurisdiction of the sending state and any escape from temporary custody may be dealt with in the same manner as an escape from the original place of imprisonment or in any other manner permitted by law.",

The provisions of this paragraph shall govern unless the states concerned shall have entered into a supplementary agreement providing for a different allocation of costs and responsibilities as between or among themselves. Nothing herein contained shall be construed to alter or affect any internal relationship among the departments, agencies and officers of and in the government of a party state, or between a party state and its subdivisions, as to the payment of costs, or responsibilities therefor.",

Accordingly, it is the policy of the party states and the purpose of this agreement to encourage the expeditious and orderly disposition of such charges and determination of the proper status of any and all detainers based on untried indictments, informations or complaints. The party states also find that proceedings with reference to such charges and detainers, when emanating from another jurisdiction, cannot properly be had in the absence of cooperative procedures. It is the further purpose of this agreement to provide such cooperative procedures.\n\nArticle II\n\nAs used in this agreement: (a) “State” shall mean a state of the United States; the United States of America; a territory or possession of the United States; the District of Columbia; the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico. (b) “Sending state” shall mean a state in which a prisoner is incarcerated at the time that he initiates a request for final disposition pursuant to article III hereof or at the time that a request for custody or availability is initiated pursuant to article IV hereof. (c) “Receiving state” shall mean the state in which trial is to be had on an indictment, information or complaint pursuant to article III or article IV hereof.\n\nArticle III\n\n(a) Whenever a person has entered upon a term of imprisonment in a penal or correctional institution of a party state, and whenever during the continuance of the term of the imprisonment there is pending in any other party state any untried indictment, information or complaint on the basis of which a detainer has been lodged against the prisoner, he shall be brought to trial within one hundred eighty days after he shall have caused to be delivered to the prosecuting officer and the appropriate court of the prosecuting officer's jurisdiction written notice of the place of his imprisonment and his request for a final disposition to be made of the indictment, information or complaint; provided that for good cause shown in open court, the prisoner or his counsel being present, the court having jurisdiction of the matter may grant any necessary or reasonable continuance. The request of the prisoner shall be accompanied by a certificate of the appropriate official having custody of the prisoner, stating the term of commitment under which the prisoner is being held, the time already served, the time remaining to be served on the sentence, the amount of good time earned, the time of parole eligibility of the prisoner, and any decisions of the state parole agency relating to the prisoner.\n\n(b) The written notice and request for final disposition referred to in paragraph (a) hereof shall be given or sent by the prisoner to the warden, commissioner of correction or other official having custody of him, who shall promptly forward it together with the certificate to the appropriate prosecuting official and court by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested.\n\n(c) The warden, commissioner of correction or other official having custody of the prisoner shall promptly inform him of the source and contents of any detainer lodged against him and shall also inform him of his right to make a request for final disposition of the indictment, information or complaint on which the detainer is based.\n\n(d) Any request for final disposition made by a prisoner pursuant to paragraph (a) hereof shall operate as a request for final disposition of all untried indictments, informations or complaints on the basis of which detainers have been lodged against the prisoner from the state to whose prosecuting official the request for final disposition is specifically directed. The warden, commissioner of correction or other official having custody of the prisoner shall forthwith notify all appropriate prosecuting officers and courts in the several jurisdictions within the state to which the prisoner's request for final disposition is being sent of the proceeding being initiated by the prisoner. Any notification sent pursuant to this paragraph shall be accompanied by copies of the prisoner's written notice, request, and the certificate. If trial is not had on any indictment, information or complaint contemplated hereby prior to the return of the prisoner to the original place of imprisonment, such indictment, information or complaint shall not be of any further force or effect, and the court shall enter an order dismissing the same with prejudice.\n\n(e) Any request for final disposition made by a prisoner pursuant to paragraph (a) hereof shall also be deemed to be a waiver of extradition with respect to any charge or proceeding contemplated thereby or included therein by reason of paragraph (d) hereof, and a waiver of extradition to the receiving state to serve any sentence there imposed upon him, after completion of his term of imprisonment in the sending state. The request for final disposition shall also constitute a consent by the prisoner to the production of his body in any court where his presence may be required in order to effectuate the purposes of this agreement and a further consent voluntarily to be returned to the original place of imprisonment in accordance with the provisions of this agreement. Nothing in this paragraph shall prevent the imposition of a concurrent sentence if otherwise permitted by law.\n\n(f) Escape from custody by the prisoner subsequent to his execution of the request for final disposition referred to in paragraph (a) hereof shall void the request.\n\nArticle IV\n\n(a) The appropriate officer of the jurisdiction in which an untried indictment, information or complaint is pending shall be entitled to have a prisoner against whom he has lodged a detainer and who is serving a term of imprisonment in any party state made available in accordance with article V(a) hereof upon presentation of a written request for temporary custody or availability to the appropriate authorities of the state in which the prisoner is incarcerated; provided that the court having jurisdiction of such indictment, information or complaint shall have duly approved, recorded and transmitted the request; and provided further that there shall be a period of thirty days after receipt by the appropriate authorities before the request be honored, within which period the governor of the sending state may disapprove the request for temporary custody or availability, either upon his own motion or upon motion of the prisoner.\n\n(b) Upon receipt of the officer's written request as provided in paragraph (a) hereof, the appropriate authorities having the prisoner in custody shall furnish the officer with a certificate stating the term of commitment under which the prisoner is being held, the time already served, the time remaining to be served on the sentence, the amount of good time earned, the time of parole eligibility of the prisoner, and any decisions of the state parole agency relating to the prisoner. Said authorities simultaneously shall furnish all other officers and appropriate courts in the receiving state who have lodged detainers against the prisoner with similar certificates and with notices informing them of the request for custody or availability and of the reasons therefor.\n\n(c) In respect of any proceeding made possible by this article, trial shall be commenced within one hundred twenty days of the arrival of the prisoner in the receiving state, but for good cause shown in open court, the prisoner or his counsel being present, the court having jurisdiction of the matter may grant any necessary or reasonable continuance.\n\n(d) Nothing contained in this article shall be construed to deprive any prisoner of any right which he may have to contest the legality of his delivery as provided in paragraph (a) hereof, but such delivery may not be opposed or denied on the ground that the executive authority of the sending state has not affirmatively consented to or ordered such delivery.\n\n(e) If trial is not had on any indictment, information or complaint contemplated hereby prior to the prisoner's being returned to the original place of imprisonment pursuant to article V(e) hereof, such indictment, information or complaint shall not be of any further force or effect, and the court shall enter an order dismissing the same with prejudice.\n\nArticle V\n\n(a) In response to a request made under article III or article IV hereof, the appropriate authority in a sending state shall offer to deliver temporary custody of such prisoner to the appropriate authority in the state where such indictment, information or complaint is pending against such person in order that speedy and efficient prosecution may be had. If the request for final disposition is made by the prisoner, the offer of temporary custody shall accompany the written notice provided for in article III of this agreement. In the case of a federal prisoner, the appropriate authority in the receiving state shall be entitled to temporary custody as provided by this agreement or to the prisoner's presence in federal custody at the place for trial, whichever custodial arrangement may be approved by the custodian.\n\n(b) The officer or other representative of a state accepting an offer of temporary custody shall present the following upon demand: (1) Proper identification and evidence of his authority to act for the state into whose temporary custody the prisoner is to be given. (2) A duly certified copy of the indictment, information or complaint on the basis of which the detainer has been lodged and on the basis of which the request for temporary custody of the prisoner has been made.\n\n(c) If the appropriate authority shall refuse or fail to accept temporary custody of said person, or in the event that an action on the indictment, information or complaint on the basis of which the detainer has been lodged is not brought to trial within the period provided in article III or article IV hereof, the appropriate court of the jurisdiction where the indictment, information or complaint has been pending shall enter an order dismissing the same with prejudice, and any detainer based thereon shall cease to be of any force or effect.\n\n(d) The temporary custody referred to in this agreement shall be only for the purpose of permitting prosecution on the charge or charges contained in one or more untried indictments, informations or complaints which form the basis of the detainer or detainers or for prosecution on any other charge or charges arising out of the same transaction. Except for his attendance at court and while being transported to or from any place at which his presence may be required, the prisoner shall be held in a suitable jail or other facility regularly used for persons awaiting prosecution.\n\n(e) At the earliest practicable time consonant with the purposes of this agreement, the prisoner shall be returned to the sending state.\n\n(f) During the continuance of temporary custody or while the prisoner is otherwise being made available for trial as required by this agreement, time being served on the sentence shall continue to run but good time shall be earned by the prisoner only if, and to the extent that, the law and practice of the jurisdiction which imposed the sentence may allow.\n\n(g) For all purposes other than that for which temporary custody as provided in this agreement is exercised, the prisoner shall be deemed to remain in the custody of and subject to the jurisdiction of the sending state and any escape from temporary custody may be dealt with in the same manner as an escape from the original place of imprisonment or in any other manner permitted by law.\n\n(h) From the time that a party state receives custody of a prisoner pursuant to this agreement until such prisoner is returned to the territory and custody of the sending state, the state in which the one or more untried indictments, informations or complaints are pending or in which trial is being had shall be responsible for the prisoner and shall also pay all costs of transporting, caring for, keeping and returning the prisoner.

However, the withdrawal of any state shall not affect the status of any proceedings already initiated by inmates or by state officers at the time such withdrawal takes effect, nor shall it affect their rights in respect thereof.\n\nArticle IX\n\nThis agreement shall be liberally construed so as to effectuate its purposes. The provisions of this agreement shall be severable and if any phrase, clause, sentence or provision of this agreement is declared to be contrary to the constitution of any party state or of the United States or the applicability thereof to any government, agency, person or circumstance is held invalid, the validity of the remainder of this agreement and the applicability thereof to any government, agency, person or circumstance shall not be affected thereby.

Any application to any court for aid in enforcing such subpoena may be made in the name of the Office of Victim Services only by a victim compensation commissioner. Subpoenas shall be served by any person designated by a victim compensation commissioner.\n\n(b) An applicant may request that a determination made pursuant to subsection (a) of this section be reviewed by a victim compensation commissioner by filing a request for review with the Office of Victim Services, on a form prescribed by the Office of the Chief Court Administrator, within thirty days from mailing of the notice of such determination.\n\n(c) For the purposes of carrying out the provisions of sections 54-201 to 54-218 , inclusive, a victim compensation commissioner shall hear any request for review filed by an applicant pursuant to sections 54-201 to 54-218 , inclusive, to which such commissioner is assigned and shall make a written determination on such application for compensation. A victim compensation commissioner shall hold such hearings and take such testimony as such commissioner may deem advisable. A commissioner may administer oaths or affirmations to witnesses and shall have full power to subpoena any witness to appear and give testimony or to issue a subpoena duces tecum. Subpoenas shall be served by any person designated by a victim compensation commissioner.\n\n(d) No witness under subpoena authorized to be issued by the provisions of this section shall be excused from testifying or from producing records, papers or documents.

The court shall cite such person to appear before said court to answer such question or to produce such records, papers or documents or to show cause why a question put to him should not be answered or why such records, papers or documents should not be produced. Upon such person's refusal to answer or produce records, papers or documents or to show cause, the court may commit such person to a community correctional center until such person complies, but not for a longer period than sixty days. Notwithstanding any such commitment of such person, the victim compensation commissioner may proceed with the hearing as if such witness had testified adversely regarding his interest in the proceeding.\n\n(e) The applicant and any other person having a substantial interest in a proceeding may appear before the victim compensation commissioner and be heard, produce evidence and cross-examine witnesses in person or by his attorney.

If an amount greater than two-thirds of that paid pursuant to any such order is recovered and collected in any such action, whether by judgment, settlement or compromise settlement before or after judgment, the state shall pay the balance exceeding two-thirds of the amount paid pursuant to such order to the applicant less any costs and expenses incurred therefor.\n\n(b) If the applicant brings an action against the person or persons responsible for such injury or death to recover damages arising out of the crime for which an award has been granted, or, if the applicant recovers money from any other source or sources including, but not limited to, payments from state or municipal agencies, insurance benefits or workers' compensation awards as a result of the incident or offense giving rise to the application, the Office of Victim Services shall have a lien on the applicant's recovery for the amount to which the office is entitled to reimbursement. If an action is brought by the applicant against the person or persons responsible for the injury or death, the applicant shall notify the Office of Victim Services of the filing of such complaint within thirty days of the filing of the complaint in court.

Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (b) of this section, if the Office of Victim Services finds that enforcement of its lien rights would cause undue harm to the applicant, the office may abrogate such rights. “Undue harm” includes, but is not limited to, considerations of victim safety and recovery by the applicant of an amount that is less than the applicant's compensable economic losses."
