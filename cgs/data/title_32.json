Persons who graduate on or after January 1, 2014, from such institutions, universities, colleges or schools may have their income tax liability, up to a maximum of two thousand five hundred dollars annually, segregated into the Connecticut first-time homebuyers account established pursuant to section 32-4j , provided not more than one million dollars from all program participants may be so segregated in any calendar year. After a period not exceeding ten years after graduation, any amounts so segregated may be withdrawn by a participant for the purchase of a first home in the state. The Commissioner of Economic and Community Development may make payments in accordance with this section from said fund to the participants. For the purposes of this section, “health care training school” means a medical or dental school, chiropractic college, school or college of optometry, school or college of chiropody or podiatry, school of occupational therapy, hospital-based occupational school, school or college of naturopathy, school of dental hygiene, school of physical therapy or any other school or institution giving instruction in the healing arts.",

Such payment may be in an amount equal to the amount of segregated funds deposited on behalf of such participant. If the payment is less than such amount, any excess amount shall be deposited in the General Fund.",
              "(2) If a participant ceases to live in the state at any time up to one year after such date, such participant shall repay one hundred per cent of the amount paid out. If a participant ceases to live in the state at any time up to two years after such date, such participant shall repay eighty per cent of the amount paid out. If a participant ceases to live in the state at any time up to three years after such date, such participant shall repay sixty per cent of the amount paid out. If a participant ceases to live in the state at any time up to four years after such date, such participant shall repay forty per cent of the amount paid out. If a participant ceases to live in the state at any time up to five years after such date, such participant shall repay twenty per cent of the amount paid out. After five years, there is no repayment obligation. Any amounts repaid under this subdivision shall be deposited in the General Fund.",

The public education program shall include, but not be limited to, information concerning life-time savings plans and information on the purchase of a home.

Such program may provide an incentive for graduates of a public institution of higher education, private university or college, or health care training school in this state, or graduates from a technical education and career school, to buy a first home in the state. Persons who graduate on or after January 1, 2014, from such institutions, universities, colleges or schools may have their income tax liability, up to a maximum of two thousand five hundred dollars annually, segregated into the Connecticut first-time homebuyers account established pursuant to section 32-4j , provided not more than one million dollars from all program participants may be so segregated in any calendar year. After a period not exceeding ten years after graduation, any amounts so segregated may be withdrawn by a participant for the purchase of a first home in the state. The Commissioner of Economic and Community Development may make payments in accordance with this section from said fund to the participants. For the purposes of this section, “health care training school” means a medical or dental school, chiropractic college, school or college of optometry, school or college of chiropody or podiatry, school of occupational therapy, hospital-based occupational school, school or college of naturopathy, school of dental hygiene, school of physical therapy or any other school or institution giving instruction in the healing arts.\n\n(b) (1) After a period not exceeding ten years after the date of graduation, a participant in the program established pursuant to subsection (a) of this section may apply to the Commissioner of Economic and Community Development for a payment to be issued, on behalf of such participant, and used as the down payment on a house, which must be the first house such participant has bought, either singly or jointly. Such payment may be in an amount equal to the amount of segregated funds deposited on behalf of such participant. If the payment is less than such amount, any excess amount shall be deposited in the General Fund.\n\n(2) If a participant ceases to live in the state at any time up to one year after such date, such participant shall repay one hundred per cent of the amount paid out. If a participant ceases to live in the state at any time up to two years after such date, such participant shall repay eighty per cent of the amount paid out. If a participant ceases to live in the state at any time up to three years after such date, such participant shall repay sixty per cent of the amount paid out. If a participant ceases to live in the state at any time up to four years after such date, such participant shall repay forty per cent of the amount paid out. If a participant ceases to live in the state at any time up to five years after such date, such participant shall repay twenty per cent of the amount paid out. After five years, there is no repayment obligation. Any amounts repaid under this subdivision shall be deposited in the General Fund.\n\n(c) On or before December 1, 2012, the Commissioner of Economic and Community Development may develop, within available appropriations, a comprehensive public education program to educate recent graduates of a public institution of higher education, private university or college, or health care training school in the state, or of a technical education and career school, about the program established under this section for first-time home buyers. The public education program shall include, but not be limited to, information concerning life-time savings plans and information on the purchase of a home. If the commissioner develops such public education program, the department shall begin to implement such program not later than January 1, 2014."

            "text": "(a) It is hereby declared that there exists concentrated poverty in the state that exacts a critical toll on poor and nonpoor residents of communities that house areas of concentrated poverty, which create lifelong and persistent disadvantages across generations by lowering the quality of educational and employment opportunities, limiting health care access and diminishing health outcomes, increasing exposure to crime, reducing available choices for affordable and properly maintained housing and imposing obstacles to wealth-building and economic mobility. It is further declared that the development and implementation of the ten-year plan under this section to eradicate concentrated poverty in the state are necessary and for the public benefit, as a matter of legislative determination.\n\n(b) There is established an Office of Neighborhood Investment and Community Engagement within the Department of Economic and Community Development. Said office shall carry out the provisions of this section, overseeing the implementation of the ten-year plan developed pursuant to this subsection, monitoring the state's progress in reducing concentrated poverty in the state and serving as the facilitator to coordinate communication between the various parties and disseminate information in a timely and efficient manner.\n\n(c) (1) There is established a pilot program to implement the provisions of the ten-year plan developed pursuant to this section for participating concentrated poverty census tracts. Any concentrated poverty census tract or group of tracts (A) that is located in any of the four municipalities with the greatest number of concentrated poverty census tracts, and (B) for which community members have established a community development corporation pursuant to the provisions of section 32-7s to assist the municipality in which such census tract or group of tracts is located in carrying out the municipality's responsibilities under this section and the ten-year plan developed for such census tract or group of tracts, shall be eligible to apply to participate in the program. Notwithstanding the provisions of subparagraph (A) of this subdivision, any municipality in which a concentrated poverty census tract or group of tracts is located and for which a community development corporation has been established as described under subparagraph (B) of this subdivision, or any such community development corporation, may apply to participate in the program. The Commissioner of Economic and Community Development shall issue a request for proposals for participation in the pilot program and select the applicant with the highest score. As used in this section, “concentrated poverty census tract” means a census tract identified as a high poverty-low opportunity census tract, as of January 1, 2024, by the Office of Policy and Management pursuant to section 32-7x of the 2024 supplement to the general statutes.\n\n(2) (A) The Office of Neighborhood Investment and Community Engagement shall develop a plan for the pilot participating concentrated poverty census tract or group of tracts, as applicable, to eradicate, over ten years, the levels of concentrated poverty in the service area of the community development corporation, evidenced by a reduction, to twenty per cent or lower, in the percentage of households who reside in such concentrated poverty census tract or group of tracts and have incomes below the federal poverty level, as well as sustained improvements in community infrastructure and other underlying conditions that serve to prolong concentrated poverty and economic inertia in such census tract or group of tracts. In developing such plan, said office shall consult with the Office of Community Economic Development Assistance established under section 32-7s , the Office of Workforce Strategy established under section 4-124w , the Office of Early Childhood, the Department of Education, the Office of Policy and Management, the applicable community development corporations serving the participating concentrated poverty census tract or group of tracts and the applicable municipal chief elected officials and any other public or private entity the Commissioner of Economic and Community Development deems relevant or necessary to achieving the purposes of this subsection.\n\n(B) The ten-year plan shall include, but need not be limited to, (i) measurable steps to be taken for its implementation, the target date by which each such step is to be completed and the state or municipal official or state or municipal agency, department or division responsible for each such step, (ii) minimum state-wide averages for educational metrics, including, but not limited to, kindergarten-readiness, grade level reading and mathematics and college-readiness or career-readiness, to be used as benchmarks for improvements in such concentrated poverty census tract or group of tracts, as applicable, and (iii) the list of possible projects determined pursuant to subdivision (3) of this subsection.\n\n(C) On or before June 1, 2025, the Commissioner of Economic and Community Development shall inform the joint standing committee of the General Assembly having cognizance of matters relating to finance, revenue and bonding, in writing, of the progress made to date in the development of the ten-year plan. Not later than January 1, 2026, said commissioner shall submit such plan to the General Assembly, in accordance with the provisions of section 11-4a , and the Office of Neighborhood Investment and Community Engagement shall immediately commence overseeing the implementation of such plan.\n\n(3) The Office of Neighborhood Investment and Community Engagement shall, jointly with the chief elected official of each applicable municipality and the community development corporation established to assist such municipality, develop a list of possible projects that will be included in the ten-year plan for the participating concentrated poverty census tract or group of tracts, as applicable, located in such municipality. Said office, official and corporation shall (A) determine the types of projects they deem to be the most appropriate and effective for such census tract or group of tracts to eradicate concentrated poverty within such census tract or group of tracts, including, but not limited to, capital projects, workforce development programs, housing development, community and neighborhood improvements and education initiatives to assist and support residents in meeting and surpassing the educational metrics described in subparagraph (B)(ii) of subdivision (2) of this subsection, and (B) take into account the criteria for projects eligible for grants under sections 32-7s , 32-7x and 32-285a .\n\n(4) Not later than February 1, 2027, and annually thereafter, the Commissioner of Economic and Community Development shall submit a report to the General Assembly, the Office of Workforce Strategy, the Office of Early Childhood and the Office of Policy and Management, in accordance with the provisions of section 11-4a , that summarizes the progress being made by the Office of Neighborhood Investment and Community Engagement in implementing the ten-year plan, the status of any projects pending or undertaken for the participating concentrated poverty census tract or group of tracts and any other information the commissioner or the Office of Neighborhood Investment and Community Engagement deems relevant or necessary.\n\n(5) (A) Commencing with the calendar year 2027, not later than March first of said year and annually thereafter for the next two years, the joint standing committee of the General Assembly having cognizance of matters relating to finance, revenue and bonding shall hold an informational forum for the Commissioner of Economic and Community Development to present the contents of the submitted report and for other state officials, municipal officials, representatives of community development corporations serving participating concentrated poverty census tracts or groups of tracts and other interested parties to provide oral and written comments on the submitted report and the pilot program.\n\n(B) Commencing with the calendar year 2030, said committee shall hold such informational forum every two years.\n\n(d) On and after the date the ten-year plan is submitted to the General Assembly pursuant to subparagraph (C) of subdivision (2) of subsection (c) of this section, each state agency shall give priority to projects included in such ten-year plan with respect to any grants or funding programs such agency awards or administers and for which such projects may be eligible.\n\n(e) Not later than January 1, 2029, the Commissioner of Economic and Community Development shall submit a recommendation to the joint standing committee of the General Assembly having cognizance of matters relating to finance, revenue and bonding of (1) whether the pilot program should be expanded to all concentrated poverty census tracts or groups of tracts in the state for which a community development corporation has been established as described under subparagraph (B) of subdivision (1) of subsection (c) of this section, and (2) any additional or alternative criteria to be considered for expansion of the pilot program to other economically disadvantaged census tracts that do not fall within the definition of a concentrated poverty census tract. If the commissioner recommends expansion under subdivision (1) of this subsection, the commissioner and the Office of Neighborhood Investment and Community Engagement shall immediately undertake such expansion.\n\n(f) On and after July 1, 2027, if any state or municipal official responsible for carrying out a requirement or responsibility under the provisions of this section or a ten-year plan fails to do so in a timely manner, any community development corporation established as described under subparagraph (B) of subdivision (1) of subsection (c) of this section that was (1) selected pursuant to the request for proposals under subdivision (1) of subsection (c) of this section, (2) can demonstrate good faith efforts to effectuate the ten-year plan, and (3) is aggrieved by such failure may bring an action against such official in the superior court for the judicial district in which such census tract or group of tracts is located for a writ of mandamus to compel such official to carry out such requirement or responsibility."

In the event that only a portion of a plant is acquired, constructed, renovated or expanded, only the portion acquired, constructed, renovated or expanded constitutes the manufacturing facility. A manufacturing facility which is leased may for the purposes of subdivisions (59) and (60) of section 12-81 and sections 12-217e , 32-9p to 32-9s , inclusive, and 32-23p , be treated in the same manner as a facility which is acquired if the provisions of the lease serve to further the purposes of subdivisions (59) and (60) of section 12-81 and sections 12-217e , 32-9p to 32-9s , inclusive, and 32-23p and demonstrate a substantial, long-term commitment by the occupant to use the manufacturing facility, including a contract for lease for an initial minimum term of five years with provisions for the extension of the lease at the request of the lessee for an aggregate term which shall not be less than ten years, or the right of the lessee to purchase the facility at any time after the initial five-year term, or both. For a facility located in an enterprise zone designated pursuant to said section 32-70 , and occupied by a business organization with an average total employment of ten or fewer employees over the six-month period preceding acquisition, such contract for lease may be for an initial minimum term of three years with provisions for the extension of the lease at the request of the lessee for an aggregate term which shall not be less than six years, or the right of the lessee to purchase the facility at any time after the initial three-year term, or both, and may also include the right for the lessee to relocate to other space within the same enterprise zone, provided such space is under the same ownership or control as the originally leased space or if such space is not under such same ownership or control as the originally leased space, permission to relocate is granted by the lessor of such originally leased space, and such relocation shall not extend the duration of benefits granted under the original eligibility certificate.

Any municipality which, at any time subsequent to July 1, 1978, has met such thresholds but which at any time thereafter fails to meet such thresholds, according to said department, shall be deemed to be a distressed municipality for a period of five years subsequent to the date of the determination that such municipality fails to meet such thresholds, except that any municipality with a population that was more than one hundred thousand as of the most recent United States census at the time of such determination shall be deemed to be a distressed municipality for a period of ten years subsequent to the date of such determination. Any distressed municipality that fails to meet the distress thresholds may elect to terminate its designation as a distressed municipality, by vote of its legislative body, not later than September 1, 1985, or not later than three months after receiving notification from the commissioner that it no longer meets such thresholds, whichever is later. In the event a distressed municipality elects to terminate its designation, the municipality shall notify the commissioner and the Secretary of the Office of Policy and Management in writing within thirty days. In the event that the commissioner determines that amendatory federal legislation or administrative regulation has materially changed the distress thresholds thereby established, “distressed municipality” means any municipality in the state which meets comparable thresholds of distress which are then applicable in the areas of high unemployment and poverty, aging housing stock and low or declining rates of growth in job creation, population and per capita income as established by the commissioner, consistent with the purposes of subdivisions (59) and (60) of section 12-81 and sections 12-217e , 32-9p to 32-9s , inclusive, and 32-23p , in regulations adopted in accordance with chapter 54. For purposes of sections 32-9p to 32-9s , inclusive, “distressed municipality” also means any municipality adversely impacted by a major plant closing, relocation or layoff, provided the eligibility of a municipality shall not exceed two years from the date of such closing, relocation or layoff.

and (3) for which the department has issued an eligibility certificate in accordance with section 32-9r . In the case of facilities which are acquired, the department may waive the requirement of one year of idleness if it determines that, absent qualification as a manufacturing facility under subdivisions (59) and (60) of section 12-81 , and sections 12-217e , 32-9p to 32-9s , inclusive, and 32-23p , there is a high likelihood that the facility will remain idle for one year. In the case of facilities located in an enterprise zone designated pursuant to said section 32-70 , (A) the idleness requirement in subparagraph (B) of subdivision (1) of this subsection, for business organizations which over the six months preceding such acquisition have had an average total employment of between six and nineteen employees, inclusive, shall be reduced to a minimum of six months, and (B) the idleness requirement shall not apply to business organizations with an average total employment of five or fewer employees, provided no more than one eligibility certificate shall be issued under this subparagraph for the same facility within a three-year period. Of those facilities which are for warehousing and distribution, only those which are newly constructed or which represent an expansion of an existing facility qualify as manufacturing facilities. In the event that only a portion of a plant is acquired, constructed, renovated or expanded, only the portion acquired, constructed, renovated or expanded constitutes the manufacturing facility. A manufacturing facility which is leased may for the purposes of subdivisions (59) and (60) of section 12-81 and sections 12-217e , 32-9p to 32-9s , inclusive, and 32-23p , be treated in the same manner as a facility which is acquired if the provisions of the lease serve to further the purposes of subdivisions (59) and (60) of section 12-81 and sections 12-217e , 32-9p to 32-9s , inclusive, and 32-23p and demonstrate a substantial, long-term commitment by the occupant to use the manufacturing facility, including a contract for lease for an initial minimum term of five years with provisions for the extension of the lease at the request of the lessee for an aggregate term which shall not be less than ten years, or the right of the lessee to purchase the facility at any time after the initial five-year term, or both. For a facility located in an enterprise zone designated pursuant to said section 32-70 , and occupied by a business organization with an average total employment of ten or fewer employees over the six-month period preceding acquisition, such contract for lease may be for an initial minimum term of three years with provisions for the extension of the lease at the request of the lessee for an aggregate term which shall not be less than six years, or the right of the lessee to purchase the facility at any time after the initial three-year term, or both, and may also include the right for the lessee to relocate to other space within the same enterprise zone, provided such space is under the same ownership or control as the originally leased space or if such space is not under such same ownership or control as the originally leased space, permission to relocate is granted by the lessor of such originally leased space, and such relocation shall not extend the duration of benefits granted under the original eligibility certificate.

Applications for eligibility certificates are to be made on the forms and in the manner prescribed by the department. In evaluating each application the department may require the submission of all books, records, documents, drawings, specifications, certifications and other evidentiary items which it deems appropriate. No eligibility certificate shall be issued after March 1, 1991, for a manufacturing facility located in a distressed municipality which does not qualify as a targeted investment community unless the department has issued to the applicant a commitment letter for such facility prior to March 1, 1991. Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection, an eligibility certificate may be issued by the department after March 1, 1991, for a qualified manufacturing facility acquired, constructed or substantially renovated in a distressed municipality provided the commissioner determines that such acquisition, construction or substantial renovation was initiated prior to March 1, 1991, and was legitimately induced by the prospect of assistance under section 12-217e and subdivisions (59) and (60) of section 12-81 , respectively. The department may issue an eligibility certificate for a qualified manufacturing facility or a qualified service facility located in a targeted investment community upon determination by the commissioner (A) that the acquisition, construction or substantial renovation relating to the qualified manufacturing facility or qualified service facility in such community was induced by the prospect of assistance under subdivisions (59) and (60) of section 12-81 ; and (B) the applicant demonstrates an economic need or there is an economic benefit to the state.

Any aggrieved applicant shall be afforded an opportunity for a public hearing on the matter within thirty days following issuance of the notice.

The Commissioner of Revenue Services may recapture such share from the taxpayer who has claimed such credits. If the commissioner is unable to recapture all or part of such share from such taxpayer, the commissioner may seek to recapture such share from any taxpayer who has assigned credits in an amount at least equal to such share to another taxpayer. If the commissioner is unable to recapture all or part of such share from any such taxpayer, the commissioner may recapture such share from any fund through which the investment was made.",
              "(3) If the commissioner has revoked the certificate of eligibility issued under subsection (h) of this section, such certificate of eligibility shall be reinstated by the commissioner if, upon a request made by the taxpayer, fund manager or community development entity who made such approved investment, an economic impact study conducted pursuant to subsection (r) of this section shall determine that the sum of all state revenue actually generated by the project in which such investment was made is greater than the amount of the total sum of tax credits claimed on the date of such analysis, provided no such request shall be made pursuant to this subsection during the calendar year in which such certificate was revoked.

Where corporations are treated as one taxpayer for purposes of this subsection, then the credit shall be allowed only against the amount of the combined tax for all corporations properly included in a combined return that, under the provisions of subdivision (2) of this subsection, is attributable to the corporations treated as one taxpayer.\n\n(2) The amount of the combined tax for all corporations properly included in a combined corporation business tax return that is attributable to the corporations that are treated as one taxpayer under the provisions of this subsection shall be in the same ratio to such combined tax that the net income apportioned to this state of each corporation treated as one taxpayer bears to the net income apportioned to this state, in the aggregate, of all corporations included in such combined return. Solely for the purposes of computing such ratio, any net loss apportioned to this state by a corporation treated as one taxpayer or by a corporation included in such combined return shall be disregarded.\n\n(n) Any taxpayer allowed a credit under this section may assign such credit to another taxpayer or taxpayers, provided such other taxpayer or taxpayers may claim such credit only with respect to a taxable year for which the assigning taxpayer would have been eligible to claim such credit and such other taxpayer or taxpayers may not further assign such credit. The taxpayer or taxpayers allowed such credit, the fund manager, the community development entity or contractually bound community development entity shall file with the Commissioner of Revenue Services information requested by the commissioner regarding such assignments, including, but not limited to, the current holders of credits as of the end of the preceding calendar year.\n\n(o) No taxpayer shall be eligible for a credit under (1) this section, and (2) section 12-217e or 38a-88a , for the same investment. No two taxpayers shall be eligible for any tax credit with respect to the same investment or the same project costs.\n\n(p) Any credit not used in the income year for which it was allowed may be carried forward for the five immediately succeeding income years until the full credit has been allowed.\n\n(q) (1) Any tax credits approved under this section that would constitute in excess of twenty million dollars in total for a single investment shall be submitted by the Commissioner of Economic and Community Development to the joint standing committee of the General Assembly having cognizance of matters relating to finance, revenue and bonding prior to the issuance of a certificate of eligibility for such investment. Said committee shall have thirty days from the date such project is submitted to convene a meeting to recommend approval or disapproval of such investment. If such submittal is withdrawn, altered, amended or otherwise changed, and resubmitted, said committee shall have thirty days from the date of such resubmittal to convene a meeting to recommend approval or disapproval of such investment. If said committee does not act on a submittal or resubmittal, as the case may be, within that time, the investment shall be deemed to be approved by said committee.\n\n(2) While the General Assembly is in session, the House of Representatives or the Senate, or both, may meet not later than thirty days following the date said committee makes a recommendation pursuant to subdivision (1) of this subsection. If such submission is not disapproved by the House of Representatives or the Senate, or both, within such time, the commissioner may issue such certificate.\n\n(3) While the General Assembly is not in regular session, the House of Representatives or the Senate, or both, may meet not later than thirty days following the date said committee makes a recommendation pursuant to subdivision (1) of this subsection. If such submission is not disapproved by the House of Representatives, the Senate, or both, within such time, the commissioner may issue such certificate.\n\n(r) Not later than July first in each year that credits allowed by this section are claimed by a taxpayer with respect to an approved investment, the commissioner may retain such persons as said commissioner may deem appropriate to conduct a study to estimate the state revenue that is being and will be generated by the eligible project in which such investment is made. Such economic impact study shall determine whether the state revenue actually generated by such eligible project is equal to the estimate of state revenue made at the time the investment in such eligible project was approved. If the sum of all state revenue actually generated by such eligible project is less than the amount of the total sum of tax credits claimed with respect to the approved investment in such project on the date of such analysis, the commissioner may determine from the person retained pursuant to this subsection the applicable recapture amount and may revoke the certificate of eligibility issued under subsection (h) of this section. The commissioner may require the taxpayer, the fund manager, community development entity or contractually bound community development entity that made such approved investment to reimburse the commissioner for all or any part of the cost of any economic impact study performed under this subsection.\n\n(s) (1) Any taxpayer which has claimed credits allowed by this section related to an investment concerning which the commissioner has revoked the certificate of eligibility issued under subsection (h) of this section, shall be required to recapture such taxpayer's pro rata share of the recapture amount as determined under the provisions of subdivision (2) of this subsection and no subsequent credit shall be allowed unless such certificate of eligibility is reinstated under the provisions of subdivision (3) of this subsection.\n\n(2) If the taxpayer is required under the provisions of subdivision (1) of this subsection to recapture its pro rata share of the recapture amount during (A) the first year such credit was claimed, then ninety per cent of such share shall be recaptured on the tax return required to be filed for such year, (B) the second of such years, then sixty-five per cent of such share shall be recaptured on the tax return required to be filed for such year, (C) the third of such years, then fifty per cent of such share shall be recaptured on the tax return required to be filed for such year, (D) the fourth of such years, then thirty per cent of such share shall be recaptured on the tax return required to be filed for such year, (E) the fifth of such years, then twenty per cent of such share shall be recaptured on the tax return required to be filed for such year, and (F) the sixth or subsequent of such years, then ten per cent of such share shall be recaptured on the tax return required to be filed for such year. The Commissioner of Revenue Services may recapture such share from the taxpayer who has claimed such credits. If the commissioner is unable to recapture all or part of such share from such taxpayer, the commissioner may seek to recapture such share from any taxpayer who has assigned credits in an amount at least equal to such share to another taxpayer. If the commissioner is unable to recapture all or part of such share from any such taxpayer, the commissioner may recapture such share from any fund through which the investment was made.\n\n(3) If the commissioner has revoked the certificate of eligibility issued under subsection (h) of this section, such certificate of eligibility shall be reinstated by the commissioner if, upon a request made by the taxpayer, fund manager or community development entity who made such approved investment, an economic impact study conducted pursuant to subsection (r) of this section shall determine that the sum of all state revenue actually generated by the project in which such investment was made is greater than the amount of the total sum of tax credits claimed on the date of such analysis, provided no such request shall be made pursuant to this subsection during the calendar year in which such certificate was revoked. For the purpose of determining whether such certificate shall be reinstated, the commissioner shall, upon receipt of a request made under this subsection, obtain one such economic impact study per calendar year and may obtain additional such economic impact studies as the commissioner deems appropriate.\n\n(t) Notwithstanding subsections (r) and (s) of this section, for a contractually bound community development entity, credit recapture for credits allowed by this section shall be governed by the terms of its allocation agreement with the community development financial institutions fund or, where such agreement is silent, by Section 45D of the Internal Revenue Code and the regulations promulgated by the United States Treasury pursuant to said section."

The aggregate amount of principal obligations of all mortgages and loans so insured shall not constitute indebtedness of the state of Connecticut for purposes of computing the debt limit under section 3-21 , provided bonds authorized to be issued pursuant to section 32-22 shall constitute indebtedness of the state of Connecticut for such purposes, whether or not obligations of the state of Connecticut are issued and outstanding in anticipation of the sale of such bonds. Any contract of insurance executed by the corporation under this section shall be conclusive evidence of eligibility for such mortgage or loan insurance, and the validity of any contract of insurance so executed or of an advance commitment to insure shall be incontestable in the hands of an approved mortgagee or lender from the date of the execution of such contract of insurance or advance commitment, except for (I) fraud or misrepresentation on the part of such approved mortgagee or lender, or (II) noncompliance with the terms of the contract of insurance or advance commitment and corporation written procedures in force at the time of issuance of the contract or the advance commitment.",

The corporation may insure any eligible mortgage or other agreement by designating such mortgage in the resolution authorizing the bonds, obligations or notes issued to provide funds to finance the economic development project or by endorsing an appropriate certificate on such mortgage or other agreement. In the case of a default in payment with respect to any mortgage or other agreement so insured, the amount of such payment shall immediately, and at all times during the continuance of such default, constitute a charge on the insurance fund and shall be applied by the corporation to the payment of taxes or insurance on the economic development project or of any bonds or notes of the corporation secured by such mortgage or other agreement, regardless of the availability of other revenues or surplus of the corporation for such payments. The corporation shall take or cause to be taken all reasonable steps to enforce the payment of amounts in default on any such mortgage or other agreement and to exercise all available remedies necessary to enforce such mortgage or other agreement and protect the security of the corporation's obligations, and in connection therewith may use any amounts in the Mortgage and Loan Insurance Fund to bid for and purchase in foreclosure or other judicial proceedings any property on which it holds a second or other subordinate mortgage the payments on which are insured under this subsection. The trustee for any bond or other obligation of the corporation or note issued in anticipation thereof or, if there be no such trustee, the holder of any such bond, obligation or note, shall have the right to bring suit to require the application as provided in this section of any amounts in the insurance fund.",
              "(e) In the case of applications for insurance under subdivision (2) of subsection (a) of this section, (1) the corporation shall not issue loan guarantees to insure loans for commercial real estate development projects or for passive real estate ownership, (2) the corporation may issue loan guarantees for projects in which the borrower intends to purchase commercial real estate for use in its principal business operations, (3) no loan guarantee shall be issued pursuant to this section for the financing or refinancing of any project unless the corporation determines that the project is otherwise unable to obtain financing in satisfactory amounts or under reasonable terms or conditions or unless the corporation determines that the borrower is unable to start, continue to operate, expand or maintain operations or relocate to this state without such guarantee, (4) no loan guarantee shall be issued pursuant to this section for the financing or refinancing of any project which the corporation determines may be financed commercially, upon reasonable terms and conditions, without such a guarantee, and which an eligible financial institution nonetheless has attempted to shift into this program, (5) the corporation shall determine whether a project has been inappropriately diverted into this program consistent with the credit availability principles set forth in any applicable guidelines for the loan guarantee program of the Connecticut Works Fund, (6) the corporation may require the participating institution to submit its loan criteria and such other information as may be appropriate and, in reviewing projects that involve the refinancing of existing loans, may require submission of the classification assigned to that loan by examiners for any federal financial regulatory institution, (7) the corporation shall maximize the leveraging capability of loan guarantees to the extent feasible, and (8) no loan guarantee shall be issued to an eligible financial institution for any loan to any executive officer, director or shareholder owning more than five per cent of the outstanding stock of such institution, or any executive officer of any other eligible financial institution or any director or shareholder owning more than five per cent of the outstanding stock of any such institution, or a member of the immediate family of such an executive officer, director or shareholder or to any company or entity controlled by any such persons.",

              "(a) In the case of default by the mortgagor or borrower, the mortgagee or lender shall take reasonable steps to correct any such default. In the case of a default which continues for more than sixty days, the mortgagee or lender shall take reasonable steps to effect an orderly disposition of the property, if any. If institution of foreclosure proceedings or of default proceedings under article 9 of title 42a or otherwise is requested by the corporation, the mortgagee or lender shall commence such action within thirty days after receipt of such request. If institution of foreclosure proceedings or of default proceedings under said article 9 of title 42a is determined by the mortgagee or lender, the mortgagee or lender shall give the corporation thirty days' notice before it commences such action. When it appears feasible, the corporation may itself make payments to the mortgagee or lender of installments of principal or interest or both, and of taxes and insurance, which payments shall be repaid, under such conditions as the corporation may prescribe, for a temporary period upon default or threatened default by the mortgagor or borrower, and the corporation may also agree to revised terms of financing when such appears prudent. The mortgagee or lender shall be entitled to receive the benefit of the insurance as hereinafter provided, upon: (1) Any sale of the mortgaged property by court order in foreclosure or a sale with the consent of the corporation by the mortgagor or subsequent owner of the property or by the mortgagee after foreclosure or acquisition by deed in lieu of foreclosure, or a sale with the consent of the corporation pursuant to default proceedings under article 9 of title 42a, provided all claims of the mortgagee against the mortgagor or others arising from the mortgage, foreclosure, default proceedings or any deficiency judgment shall be assigned to the corporation without recourse, excepting such claims as may have been released with the consent of the corporation and claims relating to contracts of insurance insuring only a portion of the mortgage payments required by the mortgage; (2) the expiration of six months after the mortgagee has taken title to the mortgaged property under judgment of strict foreclosure, foreclosure or other judicial sale, or a deed in lieu of foreclosure or default proceedings under article 9 of title 42a, if during such period the mortgagee has made a bona fide attempt to sell such property, and, if and to the extent required by the corporation, upon the conveyance of the property to the corporation and the assignment without recourse to the corporation of all claims of the mortgagee against the mortgagor or others arising out of the mortgage, foreclosure, default proceedings or deficiency judgment; (3) the entering of a judgment against the borrower and the realization upon any assets of the borrower available to satisfy such judgment, provided all remaining claims of the lender against the borrower shall be assigned to the corporation; or (4) when the corporation determines it imprudent to have proceedings under (1), (2) and (3) above, the acceptance by the corporation of a conveyance of title to the property to the corporation or the acceptance of an assignment of the mortgage without recourse to the corporation in accordance with written procedures of the corporation in effect at the time the mortgage was insured or the assignment to the corporation of any remaining claims. The corporation may prescribe by written procedures or in a contract of insurance or in the advance commitment to insure variations to the applicability of subdivision (1), (2), (3) or (4) of this subsection because such contract or advance commitment insures only a part and not all of the payments required by a mortgage or loan. Such variations may include, but shall not be limited to, the assignment or conveyance of an interest in any claim of the mortgagee against the mortgagor or borrower, the property or the mortgage which is proportionate to the amount of the insurance provided under the contract or advance commitment. Upon the occurrence of either (1), (2), (3) or (4) hereof, the obligation of the mortgagee to pay premium charges for insurance shall cease, and the corporation shall, within thirty days thereafter, pay to the mortgagee or lender ninety-eight per cent or less than ninety-eight per cent if such lesser amount is provided for in the contract of insurance prepared pursuant to the procedures in effect at the time of issuance of the contract of insurance of the sum of (A) the then unpaid principal balance of the insured indebtedness, (B) all unpaid interest accruing with respect to the insured indebtedness at the rate approved by the corporation to the date of conveyance or assignment to the corporation, as the case may be, (C) the amount of all payments made by the mortgagee or lender for which it has not been reimbursed for taxes, insurance, assessments and insurance premiums, and (D) such other necessary fees, costs or expenses of the mortgagee or lender as may be approved by the corporation.",
              "(b) Upon request of the mortgagee, the corporation may at any time, under such equitable terms and conditions as it may prescribe, consent to the release of the mortgagor from his liability under the mortgage or consent to the release of parts of the mortgaged property from the lien of the mortgage.",
              "(c) When vacancies in an economic development project are deemed by the corporation to prejudice mortgage payments insured by the corporation, the corporation may grant to the mortgagor or borrower permission to lease or rent the mortgaged property to a tenant for any use, such lease or rental to be temporary in nature and subject to such conditions as the corporation may prescribe.",
              "(d) Upon the ultimate disposition of property acquired by the corporation under this section and of the claims assigned therewith, the net amount realized by the corporation shall be computed, taking into account all expenses incurred by the corporation in handling, dealing with and disposing of such property and in collecting such claims. If the net amount so realized exceeds the amount paid to the mortgagee or lender and the expenses of the corporation, such excess shall be retained by the corporation and added to the fund created under section 32-14 but, if the net amount realized is less than the amount paid to the mortgagee and the expenses of the corporation, the mortgagor or borrower shall remain liable therefor as upon a deficiency judgment.",
              "(e) No claim for the benefit of the insurance provided in this chapter shall be accepted by the corporation except within one year after any sale or acquisition of title of the mortgaged property described in subdivision (1) or (2) of subsection (a) of this section or the entry of any judgment against the borrower as described in subdivision (3) of subsection (a) of this section.",
              "(f) Any contract of insurance made by the corporation under the authorization of this chapter shall provide that claims payable under such contract shall first be paid from any amounts readily available in the Mortgage and Loan Insurance Fund, established under section 32-14 , before any amounts available from the bond authorization contained in section 32-22 are utilized for claim payment. The faith and credit of the state is hereby pledged, pursuant to such bond authorization and in accordance with section 3-20 , to provide to the insurance fund moneys as and when necessary to make timely payments of all amounts required to be paid under the terms of any insurance contract executed by the corporation pursuant to this chapter, but not in excess of the amount of bonds so authorized by the State Bond Commission for such purpose less the amounts paid by the state for deposit to such insurance fund. The obligation of the corporation to make payments under any such insurance contract shall be limited solely to such sources and shall not constitute a debt or liability of the corporation or the state. Any insurance contract and any rule or regulation of the corporation implementing the insurance program may contain such other terms, provisions or conditions as the corporation deems necessary or appropriate, including, but not limited to, the payment of insurance premiums, the giving of notice, claim procedures, the sources for payment of claims, the priority of competing claims for payment, the release or termination of loan security and borrower liability, the timing of payment, the maintenance and disposition of projects and the use of amounts received during periods of loan delinquency or upon default, and any other provisions concerning the rights of insured parties or conditions of the payment of insurance claims."

All such bonds issued by the corporation, secured by a special capital reserve fund within the meaning of subsection (b) of section 32-23j , shall be general obligations of the corporation payable out of any revenues or other receipts, funds, or moneys of the corporation, subject only to any agreements with the holders of particular notes or bonds pledging any particular revenues, receipts, funds or moneys, provided the corporation may issue general obligation bonds of the corporation without the security of a special capital reserve fund. Any other such bonds or notes not issued in anticipation of the issuance of bonds referred to in the preceding sentence shall be special obligations of the corporation payable solely out of any revenues or other receipts, funds or moneys of the corporation pledged therefor. All such notes and such bonds may be executed and delivered in such manner and at such times, may be in such form and denominations and of such tenor and maturity or maturities, may be in bearer or registered form, as to principal and interest or as to principal alone, may be payable at such time or times not exceeding forty years from the date thereof, may be payable at such place or places whether within or without the state, may bear interest at such rate or rates payable at such time or times and at such place or places and evidenced in such manner, and may contain such provisions not inconsistent with said chapters and sections, as shall be provided in the resolution of the corporation authorizing the issuance of the bonds and notes.",
              "(b) Issuance by the corporation of one or more series of bonds or notes for one or more purposes shall not preclude it from issuing other bonds or notes in connection with the same project or any other projects, but the proceeding wherein any subsequent bonds or notes may be issued shall recognize and protect any prior pledge or mortgage made for any prior issue of bonds or notes unless in the resolution authorizing such prior issue the right is reserved to issue subsequent bonds on a parity with such prior issue.",

              "(f) The principal of and interest on bonds or notes issued by the corporation may be secured by a pledge of any revenues and receipts of the corporation derived from any project and may be additionally secured by a mortgage or deed of trust covering all or any part of a project, including any additions, improvements, extensions to or enlargements of any projects thereafter made. Such bonds or notes may also be secured by a pledge or assignment of a loan agreement, conditional sale agreement or agreement of sale or by an assignment of the lease of any project for the construction and acquisition of which said bonds or notes are issued and by an assignment of the revenues and receipts derived by the corporation from such project. The payments of principal and interest on such bonds or notes may be additionally secured by a pledge of any other property, revenues, moneys, or funds available to the corporation for such purpose. The resolution authorizing the issuance of any such bonds or notes and any such mortgage or deed of trust or lease or loan agreement, conditional sale agreement or agreement of sale or credit agreement may contain agreements and provisions respecting the establishment of reserves to secure such bonds or notes, the maintenance and insurance of the projects covered thereby, the fixing and collection of rents for any portion thereof leased by the corporation to others or the sums to be paid under any conditional sale agreement or agreement of sale entered into by the corporation with others, the creation and maintenance of special funds from such revenues and the rights and remedies available in the event of default, the vesting in a trustee or trustees of such property, rights, powers and duties in trust as the corporation may determine, which may include any or all of the rights, powers and duties of any trustee appointed by the holders of any bonds and notes and limiting or abrogating the right of the holders of any bonds and notes of the corporation to appoint a trustee under this chapter, chapter 578 and subsection (a) of section 10-409 , or limiting the rights, powers and duties of such trustee; provision for a trust agreement by and between the corporation and a corporate trust which may be any trust company or bank having the powers of a trust company within or without the state, which agreement may provide for the pledging or assigning of any revenues or assets or income from assets to which or in which the corporation has any rights or interest, and may further provide for such other rights and remedies exercisable by the trustee as may be proper for the protection of the holders of any bonds or notes and not otherwise in violation of law, and such agreement may provide for the restriction of the rights of any individual holder of bonds or notes of the corporation and may contain any further provisions which are reasonable to delineate further the respective rights, duties, safeguards, responsibilities and liabilities of the corporation; persons and collective holders of bonds or notes of the corporation and the trustee; and covenants to do or refrain from doing such acts and things as may be necessary or convenient or desirable in order to better secure any bonds or notes of the corporation, or which, in the discretion of the corporation, will tend to make any bonds or notes to be issued more marketable notwithstanding that such covenants, acts or things may not be enumerated herein; and any other matters of like or different character, which in any way affect the security or protection of the bonds or notes, all as the corporation shall deem advisable and not in conflict with the provisions hereof. Each pledge, agreement, mortgage and deed of trust made for the benefit or security of any of the bonds or notes of the corporation shall be in effect until the principal of and interest on the bonds or notes for the benefit of which the same were made have been fully paid, or until provision has been made for payment in the manner provided in the resolution or resolutions authorizing their issuance. Any pledge made in respect of such bonds or notes shall be valid and binding from the time when the pledge is made; the revenues, money or property so pledged and thereafter received by the corporation shall immediately be subject to the lien of such pledge without any physical delivery thereof or further act; and the lien of any such pledge shall be valid and binding as against all parties having claims of any kind in tort, contract or otherwise against the corporation irrespective of whether such parties have notice thereof. Neither the resolution, trust indenture nor any other instrument by which a pledge is created need be recorded. The resolution authorizing the issuance of such bonds or notes may provide for the enforcement of any such pledge or security in any lawful manner. The corporation may elect to have the provisions of title 42a, the Connecticut uniform commercial code, apply to any pledge made by or to the corporation to secure its bonds or notes by filing a financing statement with respect to the security interest created by the pledge and, in such case, the financing statement shall be filed as if the debtor were located in this state.",
              "(g) The corporation may provide in any resolution authorizing the issuance of bonds or notes that any project or part thereof or any addition, improvement, extension or enlargement thereof, may be constructed by the corporation or the lessee or any designee of the corporation, and may also provide in such proceedings for the time and manner of and requisites for disbursements to be made for the cost of such construction and disbursements as the corporation shall deem necessary or appropriate.",
              "(h) The corporation may issue notes and bonds in accordance herewith for one or more projects or to provide funds to be used for the purposes of the corporation, without reference to a particular project or projects.",
              "(i) The corporation is further authorized and empowered to issue bonds, notes or other obligations under this section the interest on which may be includable in the gross income of the holder or holders thereof under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, or any subsequent corresponding Internal Revenue Code of the United States, as from time to time amended, to the same extent and in the same manner that interest on bills, notes, bonds or other obligations of the United States is includable in the gross income of the holder or holders thereof under any such Internal Revenue Code. Any such bonds, notes or other obligations may be issued only upon a finding by the corporation that such issuance is necessary, is in the public interest, and is in furtherance of the purposes and powers of the corporation. The state hereby consents to such inclusion only for the bonds, notes or other obligations of the corporation so authorized.",

            "text": "(a) Subject to the approval of the Treasurer of the state or the Treasurer's deputy appointed pursuant to section 3-12 , and other applicable limitations of the general statutes, the corporation may borrow money and issue its bonds and notes from time to time and use the proceeds thereof for the purposes of the corporation and to carry out its powers and to pay all other expenditures of the corporation incident to and necessary in connection with such purposes including providing funds to be paid into any fund or funds to secure such bonds or notes. All such bonds issued by the corporation, secured by a special capital reserve fund within the meaning of subsection (b) of section 32-23j , shall be general obligations of the corporation payable out of any revenues or other receipts, funds, or moneys of the corporation, subject only to any agreements with the holders of particular notes or bonds pledging any particular revenues, receipts, funds or moneys, provided the corporation may issue general obligation bonds of the corporation without the security of a special capital reserve fund. Any other such bonds or notes not issued in anticipation of the issuance of bonds referred to in the preceding sentence shall be special obligations of the corporation payable solely out of any revenues or other receipts, funds or moneys of the corporation pledged therefor. All such notes and such bonds may be executed and delivered in such manner and at such times, may be in such form and denominations and of such tenor and maturity or maturities, may be in bearer or registered form, as to principal and interest or as to principal alone, may be payable at such time or times not exceeding forty years from the date thereof, may be payable at such place or places whether within or without the state, may bear interest at such rate or rates payable at such time or times and at such place or places and evidenced in such manner, and may contain such provisions not inconsistent with said chapters and sections, as shall be provided in the resolution of the corporation authorizing the issuance of the bonds and notes.\n\n(b) Issuance by the corporation of one or more series of bonds or notes for one or more purposes shall not preclude it from issuing other bonds or notes in connection with the same project or any other projects, but the proceeding wherein any subsequent bonds or notes may be issued shall recognize and protect any prior pledge or mortgage made for any prior issue of bonds or notes unless in the resolution authorizing such prior issue the right is reserved to issue subsequent bonds on a parity with such prior issue.\n\n(c) Subject to the approval of the Treasurer of the state or his deputy appointed pursuant to section 3-12 , any bonds or notes of the corporation may be sold at such price or prices, at public or private sale, in such manner and from time to time as may be determined by the corporation, and the corporation may pay all expenses, premiums and commissions which it may deem necessary or advantageous in connection with the issuance and sale thereof; and any moneys of the corporation, including proceeds from the sale of any bonds and notes, and revenues, receipts and income from any of its projects, may be invested and reinvested in such obligations, securities and other investments, including time deposits or certificates of deposit, or deposited or redeposited in such bank or banks as shall be provided in the resolution or resolutions authorizing the issuance of the bonds and notes.\n\n(d) The corporation is authorized to provide for the issuance of its bonds for the purpose of refunding any bonds of the corporation then outstanding, including the payment of any redemption premium thereon and any interest accrued or to accrue to the earliest or subsequent date of redemption, purchase or maturity of such bonds, and, if deemed advisable by the corporation, for the additional purpose of paying all or any part of the cost of constructing and acquiring additions, improvements, extensions or enlargements of a project or any portion thereof. The proceeds of any such bonds issued for the purpose of refunding outstanding bonds may, in the discretion of the corporation, be applied to the purchase or retirement at maturity or redemption of such outstanding bonds either on their earliest or any subsequent redemption date, and may, pending such application, be placed in escrow to be applied to such purchase or retirement at maturity or redemption on such date as may be determined by the corporation.\n\n(e) Whether or not the bonds or notes are of such form and character as to be negotiable instruments under article eight of title 42a, the bonds or notes shall be and are hereby made negotiable instruments within the meaning of and for all the purposes of article eight of said title 42a, subject only to the provisions of the bonds or notes for registration.\n\n(f) The principal of and interest on bonds or notes issued by the corporation may be secured by a pledge of any revenues and receipts of the corporation derived from any project and may be additionally secured by a mortgage or deed of trust covering all or any part of a project, including any additions, improvements, extensions to or enlargements of any projects thereafter made. Such bonds or notes may also be secured by a pledge or assignment of a loan agreement, conditional sale agreement or agreement of sale or by an assignment of the lease of any project for the construction and acquisition of which said bonds or notes are issued and by an assignment of the revenues and receipts derived by the corporation from such project. The payments of principal and interest on such bonds or notes may be additionally secured by a pledge of any other property, revenues, moneys, or funds available to the corporation for such purpose. The resolution authorizing the issuance of any such bonds or notes and any such mortgage or deed of trust or lease or loan agreement, conditional sale agreement or agreement of sale or credit agreement may contain agreements and provisions respecting the establishment of reserves to secure such bonds or notes, the maintenance and insurance of the projects covered thereby, the fixing and collection of rents for any portion thereof leased by the corporation to others or the sums to be paid under any conditional sale agreement or agreement of sale entered into by the corporation with others, the creation and maintenance of special funds from such revenues and the rights and remedies available in the event of default, the vesting in a trustee or trustees of such property, rights, powers and duties in trust as the corporation may determine, which may include any or all of the rights, powers and duties of any trustee appointed by the holders of any bonds and notes and limiting or abrogating the right of the holders of any bonds and notes of the corporation to appoint a trustee under this chapter, chapter 578 and subsection (a) of section 10-409 , or limiting the rights, powers and duties of such trustee; provision for a trust agreement by and between the corporation and a corporate trust which may be any trust company or bank having the powers of a trust company within or without the state, which agreement may provide for the pledging or assigning of any revenues or assets or income from assets to which or in which the corporation has any rights or interest, and may further provide for such other rights and remedies exercisable by the trustee as may be proper for the protection of the holders of any bonds or notes and not otherwise in violation of law, and such agreement may provide for the restriction of the rights of any individual holder of bonds or notes of the corporation and may contain any further provisions which are reasonable to delineate further the respective rights, duties, safeguards, responsibilities and liabilities of the corporation; persons and collective holders of bonds or notes of the corporation and the trustee; and covenants to do or refrain from doing such acts and things as may be necessary or convenient or desirable in order to better secure any bonds or notes of the corporation, or which, in the discretion of the corporation, will tend to make any bonds or notes to be issued more marketable notwithstanding that such covenants, acts or things may not be enumerated herein; and any other matters of like or different character, which in any way affect the security or protection of the bonds or notes, all as the corporation shall deem advisable and not in conflict with the provisions hereof. Each pledge, agreement, mortgage and deed of trust made for the benefit or security of any of the bonds or notes of the corporation shall be in effect until the principal of and interest on the bonds or notes for the benefit of which the same were made have been fully paid, or until provision has been made for payment in the manner provided in the resolution or resolutions authorizing their issuance. Any pledge made in respect of such bonds or notes shall be valid and binding from the time when the pledge is made; the revenues, money or property so pledged and thereafter received by the corporation shall immediately be subject to the lien of such pledge without any physical delivery thereof or further act; and the lien of any such pledge shall be valid and binding as against all parties having claims of any kind in tort, contract or otherwise against the corporation irrespective of whether such parties have notice thereof. Neither the resolution, trust indenture nor any other instrument by which a pledge is created need be recorded. The resolution authorizing the issuance of such bonds or notes may provide for the enforcement of any such pledge or security in any lawful manner. The corporation may elect to have the provisions of title 42a, the Connecticut uniform commercial code, apply to any pledge made by or to the corporation to secure its bonds or notes by filing a financing statement with respect to the security interest created by the pledge and, in such case, the financing statement shall be filed as if the debtor were located in this state.\n\n(g) The corporation may provide in any resolution authorizing the issuance of bonds or notes that any project or part thereof or any addition, improvement, extension or enlargement thereof, may be constructed by the corporation or the lessee or any designee of the corporation, and may also provide in such proceedings for the time and manner of and requisites for disbursements to be made for the cost of such construction and disbursements as the corporation shall deem necessary or appropriate.\n\n(h) The corporation may issue notes and bonds in accordance herewith for one or more projects or to provide funds to be used for the purposes of the corporation, without reference to a particular project or projects.\n\n(i) The corporation is further authorized and empowered to issue bonds, notes or other obligations under this section the interest on which may be includable in the gross income of the holder or holders thereof under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, or any subsequent corresponding Internal Revenue Code of the United States, as from time to time amended, to the same extent and in the same manner that interest on bills, notes, bonds or other obligations of the United States is includable in the gross income of the holder or holders thereof under any such Internal Revenue Code. Any such bonds, notes or other obligations may be issued only upon a finding by the corporation that such issuance is necessary, is in the public interest, and is in furtherance of the purposes and powers of the corporation. The state hereby consents to such inclusion only for the bonds, notes or other obligations of the corporation so authorized.\n\nSee Sec. 32-22 re bond issues for purposes of this chapter.\n\nSee Sec. 32-23s re interpretation of amendments to this section effective on June 29, 1981."

All such bonds or notes shall contain on the face thereof a statement to the effect that neither the state of Connecticut nor any municipality thereof other than the corporation shall be obligated to pay the same or the interest thereon and that neither the faith and credit nor the taxing power of the state of Connecticut or of any municipality is pledged to the payment of the principal of or the interest on such bonds or notes.",

              "(a) A Small Contractors' Revolving Loan Fund is created. In order to stimulate and encourage the growth and development of the state economy through the private enterprise of small contractors, the state, acting by the Department of Economic and Community Development, may provide working capital loans or provide lines of credit to small contractors from the Small Contractors' Revolving Loan Fund. For the purposes of this section, “small contractor” means contractors, subcontractors, minority business enterprises, manufacturers or service companies who have been doing business and have maintained their principal office and place of business in the state for a period of at least one year prior to the date of their application for assistance under this section, whose gross revenues in their most recently completed fiscal year did not exceed one million five hundred thousand dollars and which are considered small in accordance with such size standards as shall be established by regulations adopted by the department. In establishing such standards, the department shall consider the number of employees of the concern, provided any maximum number of employees which a small contractor may have under such definition shall vary from business to business to the extent necessary to reflect different characteristics of such business and to take proper account of other relevant factors. Not less than twenty-five per cent of the working capital loans and lines of credit provided under this section shall be made available to minority business enterprises. The department shall charge and collect interest on each such working capital loan or line of credit at a rate to be determined in accordance with subsection (t) of section 3-20 . In no event shall the total amount of such working capital loans or lines of credit provided to any single small contractor in any period of twelve consecutive months exceed two hundred thousand dollars. Payments made by small contractors on all working capital loans and lines of credit paid to the Treasurer for deposit in the Small Contractors' Revolving Loan Fund shall be transferred to the Connecticut Growth Fund established under section 32-23v . The department shall promulgate rules and regulations in accordance with chapter 54 to carry out the provisions of this section. Such rules and regulations shall establish size standards for different types of small contractors, loan procedures, repayment terms, security requirements, default and remedy provisions and such other terms and conditions as the department shall deem appropriate.",
              "(b) Each such loan or extension of credit shall be authorized by Connecticut Innovations, Incorporated or, if the corporation so determines, by a committee of the corporation consisting of the chairman and either one other member of the corporation or its chief executive officer, as specified in the determination of the corporation. Any administrative expenses incurred in carrying out the provisions of this section, to the extent not paid by the corporation or from moneys appropriated to the department, shall be paid from the Small Contractors' Revolving Loan Fund. Payments from the Small Contractors' Revolving Loan Fund to small contractors or to pay such administrative expenses shall be made by the Treasurer upon certification by the Commissioner of Economic and Community Development that the payment is authorized under the provisions of this section, under the applicable rules and regulations of the department, and, if made to a small contractor, under the terms and conditions established by the corporation or the duly appointed committee thereof in authorizing the making of the loan or the extension of credit.",
              "(c) The State Bond Commission may authorize the issuance of bonds of the state in one or more series in accordance with section 3-20 and in a principal amount necessary to carry out the purposes of this section, but not in excess of an aggregate amount of one million five hundred thousand dollars, provided said commission may not authorize the issuance of any bonds under the provisions of this section in excess of one million five hundred thousand dollars on or after June 2, 1986. All of said bonds shall be payable at such place or places as may be determined by the Treasurer pursuant to section 3-19 and shall bear such date or dates, mature at such time or times, not exceeding five years from their respective dates, bear interest at such rate or different or varying rates and payable at such time or times, be in such denominations, be in such form with or without interest coupons attached, carry such registration and transfer privileges, be payable in such medium of payment and be subject to such terms of redemption with or without premium as, irrespective of the provisions of said section 3-20 , may be provided by the authorization of the State Bond Commission or fixed in accordance therewith. The proceeds of the sale of such bonds, together with premium and interest on sale, if any, shall be deposited in the Small Contractors' Revolving Loan Fund created by this section. Such bonds shall be general obligations of the state and the full faith and credit of the state of Connecticut are pledged for the payment of the principal of and interest on such bonds as the same become due. Accordingly, and as part of the contract of the state with the holders of such bonds, appropriation of all amounts necessary for punctual payment of such principal and interest is hereby made, and the Treasurer shall pay such principal and interest as the same become due. Net earnings on investments or reinvestments of proceeds, accrued interest and premiums on the issuance of such bonds, after payment therefrom of expenses incurred by the Treasurer or State Bond Commission in connection with their issuance, shall become part of the Small Contractors' Revolving Loan Fund."

            "text": "(a) A Small Contractors' Revolving Loan Fund is created. In order to stimulate and encourage the growth and development of the state economy through the private enterprise of small contractors, the state, acting by the Department of Economic and Community Development, may provide working capital loans or provide lines of credit to small contractors from the Small Contractors' Revolving Loan Fund. For the purposes of this section, “small contractor” means contractors, subcontractors, minority business enterprises, manufacturers or service companies who have been doing business and have maintained their principal office and place of business in the state for a period of at least one year prior to the date of their application for assistance under this section, whose gross revenues in their most recently completed fiscal year did not exceed one million five hundred thousand dollars and which are considered small in accordance with such size standards as shall be established by regulations adopted by the department. In establishing such standards, the department shall consider the number of employees of the concern, provided any maximum number of employees which a small contractor may have under such definition shall vary from business to business to the extent necessary to reflect different characteristics of such business and to take proper account of other relevant factors. Not less than twenty-five per cent of the working capital loans and lines of credit provided under this section shall be made available to minority business enterprises. The department shall charge and collect interest on each such working capital loan or line of credit at a rate to be determined in accordance with subsection (t) of section 3-20 . In no event shall the total amount of such working capital loans or lines of credit provided to any single small contractor in any period of twelve consecutive months exceed two hundred thousand dollars. Payments made by small contractors on all working capital loans and lines of credit paid to the Treasurer for deposit in the Small Contractors' Revolving Loan Fund shall be transferred to the Connecticut Growth Fund established under section 32-23v . The department shall promulgate rules and regulations in accordance with chapter 54 to carry out the provisions of this section. Such rules and regulations shall establish size standards for different types of small contractors, loan procedures, repayment terms, security requirements, default and remedy provisions and such other terms and conditions as the department shall deem appropriate.\n\n(b) Each such loan or extension of credit shall be authorized by Connecticut Innovations, Incorporated or, if the corporation so determines, by a committee of the corporation consisting of the chairman and either one other member of the corporation or its chief executive officer, as specified in the determination of the corporation. Any administrative expenses incurred in carrying out the provisions of this section, to the extent not paid by the corporation or from moneys appropriated to the department, shall be paid from the Small Contractors' Revolving Loan Fund. Payments from the Small Contractors' Revolving Loan Fund to small contractors or to pay such administrative expenses shall be made by the Treasurer upon certification by the Commissioner of Economic and Community Development that the payment is authorized under the provisions of this section, under the applicable rules and regulations of the department, and, if made to a small contractor, under the terms and conditions established by the corporation or the duly appointed committee thereof in authorizing the making of the loan or the extension of credit.\n\n(c) The State Bond Commission may authorize the issuance of bonds of the state in one or more series in accordance with section 3-20 and in a principal amount necessary to carry out the purposes of this section, but not in excess of an aggregate amount of one million five hundred thousand dollars, provided said commission may not authorize the issuance of any bonds under the provisions of this section in excess of one million five hundred thousand dollars on or after June 2, 1986. All of said bonds shall be payable at such place or places as may be determined by the Treasurer pursuant to section 3-19 and shall bear such date or dates, mature at such time or times, not exceeding five years from their respective dates, bear interest at such rate or different or varying rates and payable at such time or times, be in such denominations, be in such form with or without interest coupons attached, carry such registration and transfer privileges, be payable in such medium of payment and be subject to such terms of redemption with or without premium as, irrespective of the provisions of said section 3-20 , may be provided by the authorization of the State Bond Commission or fixed in accordance therewith. The proceeds of the sale of such bonds, together with premium and interest on sale, if any, shall be deposited in the Small Contractors' Revolving Loan Fund created by this section. Such bonds shall be general obligations of the state and the full faith and credit of the state of Connecticut are pledged for the payment of the principal of and interest on such bonds as the same become due. Accordingly, and as part of the contract of the state with the holders of such bonds, appropriation of all amounts necessary for punctual payment of such principal and interest is hereby made, and the Treasurer shall pay such principal and interest as the same become due. Net earnings on investments or reinvestments of proceeds, accrued interest and premiums on the issuance of such bonds, after payment therefrom of expenses incurred by the Treasurer or State Bond Commission in connection with their issuance, shall become part of the Small Contractors' Revolving Loan Fund."

Any such bonds of Connecticut Innovations, Incorporated, shall mature at such time or times not exceeding thirty years from their date of issuance and shall be subject to the general terms and provisions of law applicable to the issuance of bonds by Connecticut Innovations, Incorporated, except that such bonds shall be issued without a special capital reserve fund as provided in subsection (b) of section 32-23j and, for purposes of section 32-23f , only the approval of the board of directors of the corporation shall be required for the issuance and sale of such bonds. Any pledge made by the municipality or Connecticut Innovations, Incorporated, for bonds issued as provided in this section shall be valid and binding from the time when the pledge is made, and revenues and other receipts, funds or moneys so pledged and thereafter received by the municipality or Connecticut Innovations, Incorporated, shall be subject to the lien of such pledge without any physical delivery thereof or further act. The lien of such pledge shall be valid and binding against all parties having claims of any kind in tort, contract or otherwise against the municipality or Connecticut Innovations, Incorporated, even if the parties have no notice of such lien. Recording of the resolution or any other instrument by which such a pledge is created shall not be required. In connection with any such assignment of taxes or payments in lieu of taxes, Connecticut Innovations, Incorporated, may, if the resolution so provides, exercise the rights provided for in section 12-195h of an assignee for consideration of any lien filed to secure the payment of such taxes or payments in lieu of taxes. All expenses incurred in providing such assistance may be treated as project costs.",
              "(b) Any proceedings authorizing the issuance of bonds under this section may contain a provision that taxes or a specified portion thereof, if any, identified in such authorizing proceedings and levied upon taxable real or personal property, or both, in a project each year, or payments or grants in lieu of such taxes or a specified portion thereof, by or for the benefit of any one or more municipalities, districts or other public taxing agencies, as the case may be, shall be divided as follows: (1) In each fiscal year that portion of the taxes or payments or grants in lieu of taxes which would be produced by applying the then current tax rate of each of the taxing agencies to the total sum of the assessed value of the taxable property in the project on the date of such authorizing proceedings, adjusted in the case of grants in lieu of taxes to reflect the applicable statutory rate of reimbursement, shall be allocated to and when collected shall be paid into the funds of the respective taxing agencies in the same manner as taxes by or for said taxing agencies on all other property are paid; and (2) that portion of the assessed taxes or the payments or grants in lieu of taxes, or both, each fiscal year in excess of the amount referred to in subdivision (1) of this subsection shall be allocated to and when collected shall be paid into a special fund of Connecticut Innovations, Incorporated, to be used in each fiscal year, in the discretion of Connecticut Innovations, Incorporated, to pay the principal of and interest due in such fiscal year on bonds issued by Connecticut Innovations, Incorporated, to finance, refinance or otherwise assist such project, to purchase bonds issued for such project, or to reimburse the provider of or reimbursement party with respect to any guarantee, letter of credit, policy of bond insurance, funds deposited in a debt service reserve fund, funds deposited as capitalized interest or other credit enhancement device used to secure payment of debt service on any bonds issued by Connecticut Innovations, Incorporated, to finance, refinance or otherwise assist such project, to the extent of any payments of debt service made therefrom. Unless and until the total assessed valuation of the taxable property in a project exceeds the total assessed value of the taxable property in such project as shown by the last assessment list referred to in subdivision (1) of this subsection, all of the taxes levied and collected and all of the payments or grants in lieu of taxes due and collected upon the taxable property in such project shall be paid into the funds of the respective taxing agencies. When such bonds and interest thereof, and such debt service reimbursement to the provider of or reimbursement party with respect to such credit enhancement, have been paid in full, all moneys thereafter received from taxes or payments or grants in lieu of taxes upon the taxable property in such development project shall be paid into the funds of the respective taxing agencies in the same manner as taxes on all other property are paid. The total amount of bonds issued pursuant to this section which are payable from grants in lieu of taxes payable by the state shall not exceed an amount of bonds, the debt service on which in any state fiscal year is, in total, equal to one million dollars.",
              "(c) The corporation may make grants or provide loans or other forms of financial assistance from the proceeds of special or general obligation notes or bonds of the corporation issued without the security of a special capital reserve fund within the meaning of subsection (b) of section 32-23j , which bonds are payable from and secured by, in whole or in part, the pledge and security provided for in section 8-134 , 8-192 , 32-227 or this section, all on such terms and conditions, including such agreements with the municipality and the developer of the project, as the corporation determines to be appropriate in the circumstances, provided any such project in an area designated as an enterprise zone pursuant to section 32-70 receiving such financial assistance shall be ineligible for any fixed assessment pursuant to section 32-71 , and the corporation, as a condition of such grant, loan or other financial assistance, may require the waiver, in whole or in part, of any property tax exemption with respect to such project otherwise available under subsection (59) or (60) of section 12-81 .",

If Connecticut Innovations, Incorporated, issues bonds for the remediation project, the amount established in the resolution shall be used for all purposes of subsection (a) of this section."

              "(b) It is found and declared that Connecticut ranks very high among the states on a per capita basis in the amounts of prime defense contracts awarded; that the economies of many areas in the state and the employment opportunities offered by many businesses in the state are heavily defense-dependent and would suffer severe adverse impacts in the event of prime defense contract cutbacks or major aerospace or defense plant closures; that, in the event that defense-dependent areas or businesses in the state were severely impacted by a prime defense contract cutback or major aerospace or defense plant closure, there would be a serious need for non-defense-related industrial and commercial development and activity in such areas or by such businesses to provide and maintain employment and tax revenues; that private and public capital investment in the construction, renovation, and expansion of nondefense manufacturing and other industrial facilities will best contribute to maintaining employment and the existing tax base and to the development of a wider-based and more balanced economy in the state; and that the tax and other financial incentives provided by this section to encourage such public and private investment in businesses and municipalities severely impacted by prime defense contract cutbacks or major aerospace or defense plant closure, are important and necessary applications of the resources of the state in the exercise of its responsibility to preserve the health, safety and general welfare in the state of its people; and therefore the necessity, in the public interest and for the public benefit and good, of the provisions of this section is hereby declared as a matter of legislative determination.",
              "(c) The Commissioner of Economic and Community Development may determine that the economy of a municipality has been severely impacted by a prime defense contract cutback or the closure of a major aerospace or defense plant with not less than eight hundred employees. The commissioner shall make such a determination only after a public hearing, at which hearing information shall be submitted to support the findings required by this section.",
              "(d) (1) In determining that a municipality has been severely impacted by a prime defense contract cutback or the closure of a major aerospace or defense plant with not less than eight hundred employees, the commissioner shall find that (A) one or more businesses in the municipality has experienced a cancellation of one or more prime defense contracts or a significant reduction in prime defense contract or related subcontract awards or orders, or the closure of a major aerospace or defense plant with not less than eight hundred employees; (B) such prime defense contract cutback or major aerospace or defense plant closure has caused or will cause a loss of employment opportunities in the municipality; (C) such prime defense contract cutback or major aerospace or defense plant closure has caused or will cause a severe adverse impact in the municipality. In making such findings, the commissioner may consider the extent to which the businesses in the municipality are, or were at the period in time before the prime defense contract cutback or major aerospace or defense plant closure occurred, dependent on prime defense contracts or on subcontracts related to such prime defense contracts or on the major aerospace or defense plant; the extent to which one or more prime defense contractors in the municipality has or plans to reduce its work force or the amount of defense subcontract awards or orders which would be performed by businesses in the municipality; the extent to which the unemployed in the municipality are or were defense workers with specialized skills not easily transferable to other industries; the existence of abandoned or underutilized defense-related manufacturing facilities in the municipality; and any other factors which the commissioner deems relevant to such finding.",
              "(2) The commissioner's determination that a municipality is severely impacted by a prime defense contract cutback or major aerospace or defense plant closure shall be effective for two years from the date of the decision of the commissioner. The commissioner may renew such determination for two additional two-year periods following a public hearing and upon making the findings required by this subsection. Notwithstanding the provisions of this subdivision, if (A) a military installation of the United States Department of Defense at which military vehicle engines were produced is located in any such municipality, (B) the military installation is closed pursuant to 10 USC 2687, and (C) the Department of Defense plans to convey the site of said installation to said municipality, the determination by the commissioner that the municipality is severely impacted by a prime defense contract cutback or major aerospace or defense plant closure shall remain effective until such conveyance and any environmental remediation of the site are completed or until such time as the plant has been reoccupied by another business, and such determination may be renewed for a period not exceeding two years.",
              "(e) Any business facility located in a municipality declared by the commissioner to be severely impacted by a prime defense contract cutback or major aerospace or defense plant closure pursuant to subsection (c) of this section, which facility would be a manufacturing facility, as defined in subsection (d) of section 32-9p , but for the fact that the facility is not in a distressed municipality, as defined in subsection (b) of section 32-9p , will be deemed a manufacturing facility for the purposes of sections 32-9p to 32-9s , inclusive, section 12-217e , and subdivisions (59) and (60) of section 12-81 , if the purpose of the construction, expansion, renovation or acquisition of such facility is not dependent on prime defense contracts or related subcontracts. The provisions of this section shall apply to a business facility located in a building that was vacant (1) on July 1, 1998, and was formerly used for defense manufacturing, or (2) on or after June 21, 2011, and was formerly a major aerospace or defense plant with not less than eight hundred employees.",
              "(f) Any municipality declared by the commissioner to be severely impacted by a prime defense contract cutback or major aerospace or defense plant closure will be deemed a distressed municipality under sections 8-190 and 8-195 for the purpose of assisting non-defense-dependent projects."

              "(a) Any municipality that was a distressed municipality under the provisions of subsection (b) of section 32-9p on February 1, 1986, may, with the approval of the Commissioner of Economic and Community Development, designate an area of such municipality as an enterprise zone. Any such area shall consist of one or two contiguous United States census tracts, contiguous portions of such census tracts or a portion of an individual census tract, as determined in accordance with the most recent United States census and, if such area is covered by zoning, a portion of it shall be zoned to allow commercial or industrial activity. The census tracts within which such designated area is located shall also meet at least one of the following criteria: (1) Twenty-five per cent or more of the persons within the individual census tracts shall have income below the poverty level, as determined by the most recent United States census, as officially updated by the appropriate state agency or institution; (2) twenty-five per cent or more of the families within the individual census tracts shall receive public assistance or welfare income, as determined by the most recent United States census, as officially updated by the appropriate state agency or institution; or (3) the unemployment rate of the individual census tracts shall be at least two hundred per cent of the state's average, as determined by the most recent United States census, as officially updated by the appropriate state agency or institution. In calculating any such percentage for one or two contiguous census tracts, contiguous portions of census tracts or a portion of an individual census tract, the commissioner shall round up to the nearest whole percentage number. If a census tract qualifies under the eligibility criteria for designation as an enterprise zone and if the commissioner determines that a census tract which is contiguous to such tract has significant job creation potential, the commissioner may include such contiguous census tract, or a portion thereof, in the enterprise zone in lieu of a second qualified census tract if such contiguous census tract meets at least one of the following reduced criteria: (A) Fifteen per cent or more of the persons within the census tract shall have income below the poverty level, as determined by the most recent United States census, as officially updated by the appropriate state agency or institution; (B) fifteen per cent or more of the families within the census tract shall receive public assistance or welfare income, as determined by the most recent United States census, as officially updated by the appropriate state agency or institution; or (C) the unemployment rate of the census tract shall be at least one hundred fifty per cent of the state's average, as determined by the most recent United States census, as officially updated by the appropriate state agency or institution. If a census tract boundary line is the center line of a street, the commissioner may include within the enterprise zone that portion of the property fronting on such street which is outside of but adjacent to the census tract. The depth of such property so included in the enterprise zone shall be determined by the commissioner at the time of the designation of the zone. If a census tract boundary line is located along a railroad right-of-way, railroad property or natural stream of water, the commissioner may include within the enterprise zone any private properties under common ownership which are traversed by the railroad right-of-way, railroad property or natural stream of water. Any private properties so affected shall be included in the enterprise zone at the time of the designation of the zone except, in the case of an enterprise zone designated prior to October 1, 1983, the commissioner may include within the zone any such property if the municipality in which the zone is located requests the commissioner to include such property not later than sixty days after October 1, 1983. If more than twenty-five per cent of the project area of a development project under chapter 132 is located in an area eligible for designation as an enterprise zone and the project plan for such development project is approved by the Commissioner of Economic and Community Development in accordance with section 8-191 , the commissioner may include the entire project area of such development project area in an enterprise zone. If more than twenty-five per cent of the project area of a municipal development project under chapter 588 l is located in an area eligible for designation as an enterprise zone and the development plan for such project is approved by the Commissioner of Economic and Community Development in accordance with section 32-224 , the commissioner may include the entire project area of such project in an enterprise zone. If more than fifty per cent of an approved redevelopment area under chapter 130 is located in an area eligible for designation as an enterprise zone, the commissioner may include the entire redevelopment area in an enterprise zone. The commissioner may also include in the area designated as an enterprise zone (i) any facility, as defined in section 32-9p , which is located outside of but contiguous to a census tract included in the zone, (ii) any private properties which are (I) under common ownership, (II) located outside of a census tract included in the zone and (III) contiguous to a railroad right-of-way which is the boundary of such a census tract, or (iii) any private properties which are located outside of a census tract included in the zone, but between the zone and a railroad right-of-way, where other segments of such railroad right-of-way serve as boundaries for the zone. The commissioner may, at any time after the designation of an area as an enterprise zone, include in such zone any area contiguous to such zone which, at the time of the designation of such zone, was eligible to be included in such zone but was not so included. The commissioner may, at any time after the designation of an area as an enterprise zone, include in such zone any property which is located within one hundred fifty feet of a stream, the center line of which is the boundary of a census tract included in such zone, and which property contains an existing building or facility, having an area equal to or greater than one hundred thousand square feet, that is or was formerly used for manufacturing purposes but is underutilized or vacant at the time the property is included in such zone. If the commissioner determines that the necessary data is not available from the most recent United States census, the commissioner may use such data as the commissioner deems appropriate. The commissioner shall include in the designation of the enterprise zone in the city of Meriden the entire parcel of land bordered by Cook Avenue, Hanover Street, Perkins Street Square, and South Colony Street.",
              "(b) Notwithstanding any provision of this section to the contrary, (1) any municipality which has an enterprise zone may with the approval of the commissioner, expand such enterprise zone by designating for inclusion in such zone one or more additional census tracts or contiguous portions of such census tract or tracts, provided such census tract or tracts are located in the municipality, are contiguous to the enterprise zone and meet the reduced criteria for contiguous census tracts in subsection (a) of this section, (2) any municipality which is contiguous to an enterprise zone which is located in another municipality may, with the approval of the commissioner, designate as an enterprise zone one or more census tracts or contiguous portions of such census tract or tracts, which are located in the municipality making such designation, provided such census tract or tracts meet the reduced criteria for contiguous census tracts in subsection (a) of this section and are contiguous to the enterprise zone located in the other municipality. When approving such an expanded or new zone under this subsection, the commissioner shall consider the development rationale, proposed local effort and job creation potential of such expanded or new zone as demonstrated by the municipality and (3) any municipality which is contiguous to an enterprise zone which is located in another municipality may, with the approval of the commissioner and the legislative body of the municipality containing the enterprise zone, designate as an enterprise zone one or more census tracts or portions of such census tract or tracts that are contiguous to the enterprise zone in the other municipality, provided no municipality which designates an enterprise zone in this manner shall be considered to be a targeted investment community, as defined in section 32-222 , or an enterprise zone community.",
              "(c) (1) On or before September 30, 1993, the Commissioner of Economic and Community Development shall approve the designation of ten areas as enterprise zones, not more than four of which shall be in municipalities with a population greater than eighty thousand and not more than six of which shall be in municipalities with a population of less than eighty thousand.",
              "(2) (A) On or after October 1, 1993, the commissioner shall approve the designation of two areas as enterprise zones. Each such area shall be in a municipality with a population of less than eighty thousand, in which there are one or more base or plant closures. Such municipalities shall be in different counties. If the commissioner approves the designation of an area of a municipality as an enterprise zone because of a plant closure in the municipality and there is a closure of another plant in any other municipality in the state by the same business, the commissioner shall also designate an area in such other municipality as an enterprise zone. If any such designated area includes a portion of a census tract in which any such base or plant is located, the census tracts in such area shall not be required to meet the eligibility criteria set forth under subsection (a) of this section for enterprise zone designation. If any such area is located elsewhere in the municipality, the census tracts in such area shall meet such eligibility criteria. As used in this subparagraph, (i) “base” means any United States or state of Connecticut military base or facility located in whole or in part within the state; (ii) “plant” means any manufacturing business or economic base business, as defined in section 32-222 ; and (iii) “closure” means any reduction or transfer in military personnel or civilian employment at one or more bases or plants in a municipality, which occurred between July 1, 1989, and July 1, 1993, or is scheduled to occur between July 1, 1993, and July 1, 1996, and exceeds two thousand persons. Such employment figures shall be certified by the Labor Department.",
              "(B) On or after October 1, 1993, the commissioner shall approve the designation of three other areas as enterprise zones, one of which shall be in a municipality with a population greater than eighty thousand and two of which shall be in municipalities with a population of less than eighty thousand. The census tracts in such areas shall meet the eligibility criteria set forth under subsection (a) of this section for enterprise zone designation. The commissioner shall approve the designation of enterprise zones under this subparagraph for those municipalities which he or she determines to have experienced the largest increases in poverty from October 1, 1989, to October 1, 1993, inclusive, based on a weighted average of the unemployment rate, caseload under the temporary family assistance program and per capita income of less than ninety per cent of the state average between 1985 and 1989. In making his determination, the commissioner may also consider the vacancy rates for commercial and industrial facilities in a municipality and a municipality's program for the implementation of an effective enterprise zone program. To the extent appropriate, the commissioner shall use the Regional Economic Models, Inc. (REMI) system in making the calculations for such determination.",
              "(C) Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (a) of this section, municipalities that were not distressed municipalities under the provisions of subsection (b) of section 32-9p on February 1, 1986, shall be eligible to designate areas as enterprise zones under subparagraph (A) or (B) of this subdivision.",
              "(3) On or after July 1, 2014, the commissioner shall approve the designation of two areas as enterprise zones as follows: (A) One area shall be in a municipality with a population of not more than fifty thousand, as enumerated in the 2010 federal decennial census, and in which is located a United States Postal Service processing center that at any point in time employed one thousand or more persons, except that such area shall only be designated as an enterprise zone for a term of five years from the date any portion of the area is transferred, provided such transfer occurs on or after July 1, 2014, and (B) one area shall be in a municipality with a population of not less than seven thousand eight hundred and not more than seven thousand nine hundred, as enumerated in the 2010 federal decennial census, and having a total area of not more than 12.2 square miles. Each such enterprise zone area shall consist of two contiguous United States census tracts, contiguous portions of such census tracts or all or a portion of an individual census tract, as determined in accordance with the most recent federal decennial census and, if such area is covered by zoning, a portion of such area shall be zoned to allow commercial or industrial activity. The census tracts in each such enterprise zone area shall not be required to meet the eligibility criteria set forth in subsection (a) of this section. Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (a) of this section, municipalities that were not distressed municipalities under the provisions of subsection (b) of section 32-9p on February 1, 1986, shall be eligible to designate areas as enterprise zones under this subdivision.",
              "(4) (A) The commissioner shall not approve the designation of more than one enterprise zone in any municipality. The commissioner shall adopt regulations in accordance with chapter 54 concerning such additional qualifications for an area to become an enterprise zone as he or she deems necessary.",
              "(B) The commissioner may remove the designation of any area he or she has approved as an enterprise zone if such area no longer meets the criteria for designation as such an area set forth in this section or in regulations adopted pursuant to this section, except that no such designation shall be removed (i) less than ten years from the original date of approval of such zone, or (ii) if the number of residents in such area with income below the poverty level, as determined by the most recent United States census, has not been reduced by at least seventy-five per cent from the original date of approval of such zone.",
              "(C) The commissioner may designate any additional area as an enterprise zone if that area is designated as an enterprise zone, empowerment zone or enterprise community pursuant to any federal legislation.",
              "(d) Each municipality seeking the approval of the Commissioner of Economic and Community Development for the designation of an area of the municipality as an enterprise zone shall file with the commissioner a preliminary application. Not later than sixty days after receipt of such a preliminary application, the commissioner shall indicate to the municipality, in writing, any recommendations for improving the municipality's application. Not later than sixty days after receipt of the commissioner's written response, the municipality shall file a final application with the commissioner.",
              "(e) The Department of Economic and Community Development shall compile information on activities and programs which are conducted in enterprise zones approved by the commissioner before and after July 1, 1986, and shall serve as a resource center for the dissemination of such information upon request."

            "text": "(a) Any municipality that was a distressed municipality under the provisions of subsection (b) of section 32-9p on February 1, 1986, may, with the approval of the Commissioner of Economic and Community Development, designate an area of such municipality as an enterprise zone. Any such area shall consist of one or two contiguous United States census tracts, contiguous portions of such census tracts or a portion of an individual census tract, as determined in accordance with the most recent United States census and, if such area is covered by zoning, a portion of it shall be zoned to allow commercial or industrial activity. The census tracts within which such designated area is located shall also meet at least one of the following criteria: (1) Twenty-five per cent or more of the persons within the individual census tracts shall have income below the poverty level, as determined by the most recent United States census, as officially updated by the appropriate state agency or institution; (2) twenty-five per cent or more of the families within the individual census tracts shall receive public assistance or welfare income, as determined by the most recent United States census, as officially updated by the appropriate state agency or institution; or (3) the unemployment rate of the individual census tracts shall be at least two hundred per cent of the state's average, as determined by the most recent United States census, as officially updated by the appropriate state agency or institution. In calculating any such percentage for one or two contiguous census tracts, contiguous portions of census tracts or a portion of an individual census tract, the commissioner shall round up to the nearest whole percentage number. If a census tract qualifies under the eligibility criteria for designation as an enterprise zone and if the commissioner determines that a census tract which is contiguous to such tract has significant job creation potential, the commissioner may include such contiguous census tract, or a portion thereof, in the enterprise zone in lieu of a second qualified census tract if such contiguous census tract meets at least one of the following reduced criteria: (A) Fifteen per cent or more of the persons within the census tract shall have income below the poverty level, as determined by the most recent United States census, as officially updated by the appropriate state agency or institution; (B) fifteen per cent or more of the families within the census tract shall receive public assistance or welfare income, as determined by the most recent United States census, as officially updated by the appropriate state agency or institution; or (C) the unemployment rate of the census tract shall be at least one hundred fifty per cent of the state's average, as determined by the most recent United States census, as officially updated by the appropriate state agency or institution. If a census tract boundary line is the center line of a street, the commissioner may include within the enterprise zone that portion of the property fronting on such street which is outside of but adjacent to the census tract. The depth of such property so included in the enterprise zone shall be determined by the commissioner at the time of the designation of the zone. If a census tract boundary line is located along a railroad right-of-way, railroad property or natural stream of water, the commissioner may include within the enterprise zone any private properties under common ownership which are traversed by the railroad right-of-way, railroad property or natural stream of water. Any private properties so affected shall be included in the enterprise zone at the time of the designation of the zone except, in the case of an enterprise zone designated prior to October 1, 1983, the commissioner may include within the zone any such property if the municipality in which the zone is located requests the commissioner to include such property not later than sixty days after October 1, 1983. If more than twenty-five per cent of the project area of a development project under chapter 132 is located in an area eligible for designation as an enterprise zone and the project plan for such development project is approved by the Commissioner of Economic and Community Development in accordance with section 8-191 , the commissioner may include the entire project area of such development project area in an enterprise zone. If more than twenty-five per cent of the project area of a municipal development project under chapter 588 l is located in an area eligible for designation as an enterprise zone and the development plan for such project is approved by the Commissioner of Economic and Community Development in accordance with section 32-224 , the commissioner may include the entire project area of such project in an enterprise zone. If more than fifty per cent of an approved redevelopment area under chapter 130 is located in an area eligible for designation as an enterprise zone, the commissioner may include the entire redevelopment area in an enterprise zone. The commissioner may also include in the area designated as an enterprise zone (i) any facility, as defined in section 32-9p , which is located outside of but contiguous to a census tract included in the zone, (ii) any private properties which are (I) under common ownership, (II) located outside of a census tract included in the zone and (III) contiguous to a railroad right-of-way which is the boundary of such a census tract, or (iii) any private properties which are located outside of a census tract included in the zone, but between the zone and a railroad right-of-way, where other segments of such railroad right-of-way serve as boundaries for the zone. The commissioner may, at any time after the designation of an area as an enterprise zone, include in such zone any area contiguous to such zone which, at the time of the designation of such zone, was eligible to be included in such zone but was not so included. The commissioner may, at any time after the designation of an area as an enterprise zone, include in such zone any property which is located within one hundred fifty feet of a stream, the center line of which is the boundary of a census tract included in such zone, and which property contains an existing building or facility, having an area equal to or greater than one hundred thousand square feet, that is or was formerly used for manufacturing purposes but is underutilized or vacant at the time the property is included in such zone. If the commissioner determines that the necessary data is not available from the most recent United States census, the commissioner may use such data as the commissioner deems appropriate. The commissioner shall include in the designation of the enterprise zone in the city of Meriden the entire parcel of land bordered by Cook Avenue, Hanover Street, Perkins Street Square, and South Colony Street.\n\n(b) Notwithstanding any provision of this section to the contrary, (1) any municipality which has an enterprise zone may with the approval of the commissioner, expand such enterprise zone by designating for inclusion in such zone one or more additional census tracts or contiguous portions of such census tract or tracts, provided such census tract or tracts are located in the municipality, are contiguous to the enterprise zone and meet the reduced criteria for contiguous census tracts in subsection (a) of this section, (2) any municipality which is contiguous to an enterprise zone which is located in another municipality may, with the approval of the commissioner, designate as an enterprise zone one or more census tracts or contiguous portions of such census tract or tracts, which are located in the municipality making such designation, provided such census tract or tracts meet the reduced criteria for contiguous census tracts in subsection (a) of this section and are contiguous to the enterprise zone located in the other municipality. When approving such an expanded or new zone under this subsection, the commissioner shall consider the development rationale, proposed local effort and job creation potential of such expanded or new zone as demonstrated by the municipality and (3) any municipality which is contiguous to an enterprise zone which is located in another municipality may, with the approval of the commissioner and the legislative body of the municipality containing the enterprise zone, designate as an enterprise zone one or more census tracts or portions of such census tract or tracts that are contiguous to the enterprise zone in the other municipality, provided no municipality which designates an enterprise zone in this manner shall be considered to be a targeted investment community, as defined in section 32-222 , or an enterprise zone community.\n\n(c) (1) On or before September 30, 1993, the Commissioner of Economic and Community Development shall approve the designation of ten areas as enterprise zones, not more than four of which shall be in municipalities with a population greater than eighty thousand and not more than six of which shall be in municipalities with a population of less than eighty thousand.\n\n(2) (A) On or after October 1, 1993, the commissioner shall approve the designation of two areas as enterprise zones. Each such area shall be in a municipality with a population of less than eighty thousand, in which there are one or more base or plant closures. Such municipalities shall be in different counties. If the commissioner approves the designation of an area of a municipality as an enterprise zone because of a plant closure in the municipality and there is a closure of another plant in any other municipality in the state by the same business, the commissioner shall also designate an area in such other municipality as an enterprise zone. If any such designated area includes a portion of a census tract in which any such base or plant is located, the census tracts in such area shall not be required to meet the eligibility criteria set forth under subsection (a) of this section for enterprise zone designation. If any such area is located elsewhere in the municipality, the census tracts in such area shall meet such eligibility criteria. As used in this subparagraph, (i) “base” means any United States or state of Connecticut military base or facility located in whole or in part within the state; (ii) “plant” means any manufacturing business or economic base business, as defined in section 32-222 ; and (iii) “closure” means any reduction or transfer in military personnel or civilian employment at one or more bases or plants in a municipality, which occurred between July 1, 1989, and July 1, 1993, or is scheduled to occur between July 1, 1993, and July 1, 1996, and exceeds two thousand persons. Such employment figures shall be certified by the Labor Department.\n\n(B) On or after October 1, 1993, the commissioner shall approve the designation of three other areas as enterprise zones, one of which shall be in a municipality with a population greater than eighty thousand and two of which shall be in municipalities with a population of less than eighty thousand. The census tracts in such areas shall meet the eligibility criteria set forth under subsection (a) of this section for enterprise zone designation. The commissioner shall approve the designation of enterprise zones under this subparagraph for those municipalities which he or she determines to have experienced the largest increases in poverty from October 1, 1989, to October 1, 1993, inclusive, based on a weighted average of the unemployment rate, caseload under the temporary family assistance program and per capita income of less than ninety per cent of the state average between 1985 and 1989. In making his determination, the commissioner may also consider the vacancy rates for commercial and industrial facilities in a municipality and a municipality's program for the implementation of an effective enterprise zone program. To the extent appropriate, the commissioner shall use the Regional Economic Models, Inc. (REMI) system in making the calculations for such determination.\n\n(C) Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (a) of this section, municipalities that were not distressed municipalities under the provisions of subsection (b) of section 32-9p on February 1, 1986, shall be eligible to designate areas as enterprise zones under subparagraph (A) or (B) of this subdivision.\n\n(3) On or after July 1, 2014, the commissioner shall approve the designation of two areas as enterprise zones as follows: (A) One area shall be in a municipality with a population of not more than fifty thousand, as enumerated in the 2010 federal decennial census, and in which is located a United States Postal Service processing center that at any point in time employed one thousand or more persons, except that such area shall only be designated as an enterprise zone for a term of five years from the date any portion of the area is transferred, provided such transfer occurs on or after July 1, 2014, and (B) one area shall be in a municipality with a population of not less than seven thousand eight hundred and not more than seven thousand nine hundred, as enumerated in the 2010 federal decennial census, and having a total area of not more than 12.2 square miles. Each such enterprise zone area shall consist of two contiguous United States census tracts, contiguous portions of such census tracts or all or a portion of an individual census tract, as determined in accordance with the most recent federal decennial census and, if such area is covered by zoning, a portion of such area shall be zoned to allow commercial or industrial activity. The census tracts in each such enterprise zone area shall not be required to meet the eligibility criteria set forth in subsection (a) of this section. Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (a) of this section, municipalities that were not distressed municipalities under the provisions of subsection (b) of section 32-9p on February 1, 1986, shall be eligible to designate areas as enterprise zones under this subdivision.\n\n(4) (A) The commissioner shall not approve the designation of more than one enterprise zone in any municipality. The commissioner shall adopt regulations in accordance with chapter 54 concerning such additional qualifications for an area to become an enterprise zone as he or she deems necessary.\n\n(B) The commissioner may remove the designation of any area he or she has approved as an enterprise zone if such area no longer meets the criteria for designation as such an area set forth in this section or in regulations adopted pursuant to this section, except that no such designation shall be removed (i) less than ten years from the original date of approval of such zone, or (ii) if the number of residents in such area with income below the poverty level, as determined by the most recent United States census, has not been reduced by at least seventy-five per cent from the original date of approval of such zone.\n\n(C) The commissioner may designate any additional area as an enterprise zone if that area is designated as an enterprise zone, empowerment zone or enterprise community pursuant to any federal legislation.\n\n(d) Each municipality seeking the approval of the Commissioner of Economic and Community Development for the designation of an area of the municipality as an enterprise zone shall file with the commissioner a preliminary application. Not later than sixty days after receipt of such a preliminary application, the commissioner shall indicate to the municipality, in writing, any recommendations for improving the municipality's application. Not later than sixty days after receipt of the commissioner's written response, the municipality shall file a final application with the commissioner.\n\n(e) The Department of Economic and Community Development shall compile information on activities and programs which are conducted in enterprise zones approved by the commissioner before and after July 1, 1986, and shall serve as a resource center for the dissemination of such information upon request."

The board may issue such types of bonds as it may determine, including, but not limited to, bonds payable as to principal and interest: (1) From its revenues generally; (2) exclusively from the income and revenues of a particular project; or (3) exclusively from the income and revenues of certain designated projects, whether or not they are financed in whole or in part from the proceeds of such bonds. Any such bonds may be additionally secured by a pledge of any grant or contribution from a participating municipality, the state or any political subdivision, agency or instrumentality thereof, any federal agency or any private corporation, copartnership, association or individual, or a pledge of any income or revenues of the board, or a mortgage on any project or other property of the board, provided such pledge shall not create any liability on the entity making such grant or contribution beyond the amount of such grant or contribution. Whenever and for so long as any board has issued and has outstanding bonds, the board shall fix, charge and collect rates, rents, fees and other charges in accordance with subsections (j) and (k) of this section. Neither the members of the board nor any person executing the bonds shall be liable personally on the bonds by reason of the issuance thereof. The bonds and other obligations shall so state on their face that they shall not be a debt of the state or any political subdivision thereof, except when the board or a participating municipality, in accordance with subsection (f) of section 32-80c , has guaranteed payment of principal and of interest on the same, and no person other than the board or such a public body shall be liable thereon, nor shall such bonds or obligations be payable out of any funds or properties other than those of the board or such a participating municipality. Such bonds shall not constitute an indebtedness within the meaning of any statutory limitation on the indebtedness of any participating municipality. Bonds of the board are declared to be issued for an essential public and governmental purpose. In anticipation of the sale of such revenue bonds, the board may issue negotiable bond anticipation notes and may renew the same from time to time. The maximum maturity of any such note, including renewals thereof, shall not exceed five years from the date of original issue. Such notes shall be paid from any revenues of the board available therefor and not otherwise pledged or from the proceeds of sale of the revenue bonds of the energy improvement district board in anticipation of which they were issued.

Notwithstanding the provisions of sections 32-80a to 32-80c , inclusive, or any recitals in any bonds issued pursuant to subsections (a) to (h), inclusive, of this section, all such bonds shall be deemed to be negotiable instruments under the provisions of the general statutes.",

If any such notice is published and if no action or proceeding questions the validity or proper authorization of bonds provided for by the bond resolution referred to in such notice or the validity of any covenants, agreements or contracts provided for by the bond resolution is commenced or instituted not later than twenty days after the first publication of said notice, then all residents and taxpayers and owners of property in each participating municipality and all other persons shall be forever barred and foreclosed from instituting or commencing any action or proceeding in any court or from pleading any defense to any action or proceeding questioning the validity or proper authorization of such bonds or the validity of such covenants, agreements or contracts, and said bonds, covenants, agreements and contracts shall be conclusively deemed to be valid and binding obligations in accordance with their terms and tenor.",
              "(h) Notwithstanding any provision of the general statutes, (1) the state shall not have any liability or responsibility with regard to any obligation issued by the board, and (2) no political subdivision of the state shall have any liability or responsibility with regard to any obligation issued by the board except as expressly provided by sections 32-80a to 32-80c , inclusive.",
              "(i) An energy improvement district board may secure any bonds issued pursuant to subsection (b) of section 32-80a by a trust indenture by way of conveyance, deed of trust or mortgage of any project or any other property of the board, whether or not financed in whole or in part from the proceeds of such bonds, or by a trust agreement by and between the board and a corporate trustee, which may be any trust company or bank having the powers of a trust company within or without the state or by both such conveyance, deed of trust or mortgage and indenture or trust agreement. Such trust indenture or agreement may pledge or assign any or all fees, rents and other charges to be received or proceeds of any contract or contracts pledged, and may convey or mortgage any property of the board. Such trust indenture or agreement may contain such provisions for protecting and enforcing the right and remedies of the bondholders as may be reasonable and proper and not in violation of law, including provisions that have been specifically authorized to be included in any resolution or resolutions of the board authorizing the issue of bonds. Any bank or trust company incorporated under the laws of the state may act as depository of the proceeds of such bonds or of revenues or other moneys and may furnish such indemnifying bonds or pledge such securities as may be required by the board. Such trust indenture may set forth rights and remedies of the bondholders and of the trustee and may restrict the individual right of action by bondholders. In addition, such trust indenture or agreement may contain such other provisions as the board may deem reasonable and proper for the security of the bondholders. All expenses incurred in carrying out the provisions of such trust indenture or agreement may be treated as part of the cost of a project.",
              "(j) An energy improvement district board may fix, revise, charge and collect rates, rents, fees and charges for the use of and for the services furnished or to be furnished by each project and to contract with any person, partnership, association or corporation, or other body, public or private, in respect thereof. Such rates, rents, fees and charges shall be fixed and adjusted in respect of the aggregate of rates, rents, fees and charges from such project so as to provide funds sufficient with other revenues, if any, to (1) pay the cost of maintaining, repairing and operating the project and each and every portion thereof, to the extent that the payment of such cost has not otherwise been adequately provided for, (2) pay the principal and interest of outstanding revenue bonds of the board issued in respect of such project as the same shall become due and payable, and (3) create and maintain reserves required or provided for in any resolution authorizing, or trust agreement securing, such revenue bonds of the board. Such rates, rents, fees and charges shall not be subject to supervision or regulation by any department, commission, board, body, bureau or agency of this state other than the board. A sufficient amount of the revenues derived in respect of a project, except such part of such revenues as may be necessary to pay the cost of maintenance, repair and operation and to provide reserves and for renewals, replacements, extensions, enlargements and improvements as may be provided for in the resolution authorizing the issuance of any revenue bonds of the board or in the trust agreement securing the same, shall be set aside at such regular intervals as may be provided in such resolution or trust agreement in a sinking or other similar fund which is hereby pledged to, and charged with, the payment of the principal of and the interest on such revenue bonds as the same shall become due, and the redemption price or the purchase price of bonds retired by call or purchase as therein provided. Such pledge shall be valid and binding from the time when the pledge is made; the rates, rents, fees and charges and other revenues or other moneys so pledged and thereafter received by the board shall immediately be subject to the lien of any such pledge, without any physical delivery thereof or further act, and the lien of any such pledge shall be valid and binding as against all parties having claims of any kind in tort, contract or otherwise against the board, irrespective of whether such parties have notice thereof. Neither the resolution nor any trust indenture or agreement by which a pledge is created need be filed or recorded except in the records of the board. The use and disposition of moneys to the credit of such sinking or other similar fund shall be subject to the provisions of the resolution authorizing the issuance of such bonds or of such trust agreement.

            "text": "(a) An energy improvement district board may, from time to time, issue bonds subject to the approval of the legislative body in the municipality in which the energy improvement district is located for the purpose of paying all or any part of the cost of acquiring, purchasing, constructing, reconstructing, improving or extending any energy improvement district distributed resources project and acquiring necessary land and equipment thereof or for any other authorized purpose of the board. The board may issue such types of bonds as it may determine, including, but not limited to, bonds payable as to principal and interest: (1) From its revenues generally; (2) exclusively from the income and revenues of a particular project; or (3) exclusively from the income and revenues of certain designated projects, whether or not they are financed in whole or in part from the proceeds of such bonds. Any such bonds may be additionally secured by a pledge of any grant or contribution from a participating municipality, the state or any political subdivision, agency or instrumentality thereof, any federal agency or any private corporation, copartnership, association or individual, or a pledge of any income or revenues of the board, or a mortgage on any project or other property of the board, provided such pledge shall not create any liability on the entity making such grant or contribution beyond the amount of such grant or contribution. Whenever and for so long as any board has issued and has outstanding bonds, the board shall fix, charge and collect rates, rents, fees and other charges in accordance with subsections (j) and (k) of this section. Neither the members of the board nor any person executing the bonds shall be liable personally on the bonds by reason of the issuance thereof. The bonds and other obligations shall so state on their face that they shall not be a debt of the state or any political subdivision thereof, except when the board or a participating municipality, in accordance with subsection (f) of section 32-80c , has guaranteed payment of principal and of interest on the same, and no person other than the board or such a public body shall be liable thereon, nor shall such bonds or obligations be payable out of any funds or properties other than those of the board or such a participating municipality. Such bonds shall not constitute an indebtedness within the meaning of any statutory limitation on the indebtedness of any participating municipality. Bonds of the board are declared to be issued for an essential public and governmental purpose. In anticipation of the sale of such revenue bonds, the board may issue negotiable bond anticipation notes and may renew the same from time to time. The maximum maturity of any such note, including renewals thereof, shall not exceed five years from the date of original issue. Such notes shall be paid from any revenues of the board available therefor and not otherwise pledged or from the proceeds of sale of the revenue bonds of the energy improvement district board in anticipation of which they were issued. The board shall issue the notes in the same manner as the revenue bonds. Such notes and the resolution or resolutions authorizing the same may contain any provisions, conditions or limitations that a bond resolution of the board may contain.\n\n(b) An energy improvement district board may issue bonds as serial bonds, as term bonds or as both. Bonds shall be authorized by resolution of the members of the authority and shall bear such date or dates, mature at such time or times, not exceeding twenty years from their respective dates, bear interest at such rate or rates, or have provisions for the manner of determining such rate or rates, payable at such time or times, be in such denominations, be in such form, either coupon or registered, carry such registration privileges, be executed in such manner, be payable in lawful money of the United States of America at such place or places, and be subject to such terms of redemption, as such resolution or resolutions may provide. The revenue bonds or notes may be sold at public or private sale for such price or prices as the energy improvement district board shall determine. Pending preparation of the definitive bonds, the energy improvement district board may issue interim receipts or certificates that shall be exchanged for such definitive bonds.\n\n(c) Any resolution or resolutions authorizing any revenue bonds or any issue of revenue bonds may contain provisions, which shall be part of the contract with the holders of the revenue bonds to be authorized, as to: (1) Pledging all or any part of the revenues of a project or any revenue-producing contract or contracts made by the energy improvement district board with any individual, partnership, corporation or association or other body, public or private, to secure the payment of the revenue bonds or of any particular issue of revenue bonds, subject to such agreements with bondholders as may then exist; (2) the rentals, fees and other charges to be charged, the amounts to be raised in each year thereby and the use and disposition of the revenues; (3) the setting aside of reserves or sinking funds or other funds or accounts as the board may establish and the regulation and disposition thereof, including requirements that any such funds and accounts be held separate from or not be commingled with other funds of the board; (4) limitations on the right of the board or its agent to restrict and regulate the use of the project; (5) limitations on the purpose to which the proceeds of sale of any issue of revenue bonds then or thereafter to be issued may be applied and pledging such proceeds to secure the payment of the revenue bonds or any issue of the revenue bonds; (6) limitations on the issuance of additional bonds, the terms upon which additional bonds may be issued and secured and the refunding of outstanding bonds; (7) the procedure, if any, by which the terms of any contract with bondholders may be amended or abrogated, the amount of bonds the holders of which must consent thereto and the manner in which such consent may be given; (8) limitations on the amount of moneys derived from the project to be expended for operating, administrative or other expenses of the board; (9) defining the acts or omissions to act that shall constitute a default in the duties of the board to holders of its obligations and providing the rights and remedies of such holders in the event of a default; (10) the mortgaging of a project and the site thereof for the purpose of securing the bondholder; and (11) provisions for the execution of reimbursement agreements or similar agreements in connection with credit facilities, including, but not limited to, letters of credit or policies of bond insurance, remarketing agreements and agreements for the purpose of moderating interest rate fluctuations.\n\n(d) If any member whose signature or a facsimile of whose signature appears on any bonds or coupons ceases to be such member before delivery of such bonds, such signature or such facsimile shall nevertheless be valid and sufficient for all purposes as if he had remained in office until such delivery. Notwithstanding the provisions of sections 32-80a to 32-80c , inclusive, or any recitals in any bonds issued pursuant to subsections (a) to (h), inclusive, of this section, all such bonds shall be deemed to be negotiable instruments under the provisions of the general statutes.\n\n(e) Unless otherwise provided by the ordinance creating the energy improvement district board, the board may issue bonds pursuant to subsections (a) to (h), inclusive, of this section, without obtaining the consent of the state or of any political subdivision thereof and without any other proceedings or conditions specifically required by sections 32-80a to 32-80c , inclusive.\n\n(f) An energy improvement district board may, within available funds, purchase its bonds or notes. The energy improvement district board may hold, pledge, cancel or resell such bonds, subject to and in accordance with agreements with bondholders.\n\n(g) An energy improvement district board shall cause a copy of any bond resolutions adopted by it to be filed for public inspection in its office and in the office of the clerk of each participating municipality and may thereupon cause to be published at least once, in a newspaper published or circulating in each participating municipality, a notice stating the fact and date of such adoption and the places where such bond resolution has been so filed for public inspection and the date of the first publication of such notice and also stating that any action or proceeding of any kind or nature in any court questioning the validity or proper authorization of bonds provided for by the bond resolution, or the validity of any covenants, agreements or contracts provided for by the bond resolution, shall be commenced not later than twenty days after the first publication of such notice. If any such notice is published and if no action or proceeding questions the validity or proper authorization of bonds provided for by the bond resolution referred to in such notice or the validity of any covenants, agreements or contracts provided for by the bond resolution is commenced or instituted not later than twenty days after the first publication of said notice, then all residents and taxpayers and owners of property in each participating municipality and all other persons shall be forever barred and foreclosed from instituting or commencing any action or proceeding in any court or from pleading any defense to any action or proceeding questioning the validity or proper authorization of such bonds or the validity of such covenants, agreements or contracts, and said bonds, covenants, agreements and contracts shall be conclusively deemed to be valid and binding obligations in accordance with their terms and tenor.\n\n(h) Notwithstanding any provision of the general statutes, (1) the state shall not have any liability or responsibility with regard to any obligation issued by the board, and (2) no political subdivision of the state shall have any liability or responsibility with regard to any obligation issued by the board except as expressly provided by sections 32-80a to 32-80c , inclusive.\n\n(i) An energy improvement district board may secure any bonds issued pursuant to subsection (b) of section 32-80a by a trust indenture by way of conveyance, deed of trust or mortgage of any project or any other property of the board, whether or not financed in whole or in part from the proceeds of such bonds, or by a trust agreement by and between the board and a corporate trustee, which may be any trust company or bank having the powers of a trust company within or without the state or by both such conveyance, deed of trust or mortgage and indenture or trust agreement. Such trust indenture or agreement may pledge or assign any or all fees, rents and other charges to be received or proceeds of any contract or contracts pledged, and may convey or mortgage any property of the board. Such trust indenture or agreement may contain such provisions for protecting and enforcing the right and remedies of the bondholders as may be reasonable and proper and not in violation of law, including provisions that have been specifically authorized to be included in any resolution or resolutions of the board authorizing the issue of bonds. Any bank or trust company incorporated under the laws of the state may act as depository of the proceeds of such bonds or of revenues or other moneys and may furnish such indemnifying bonds or pledge such securities as may be required by the board. Such trust indenture may set forth rights and remedies of the bondholders and of the trustee and may restrict the individual right of action by bondholders. In addition, such trust indenture or agreement may contain such other provisions as the board may deem reasonable and proper for the security of the bondholders. All expenses incurred in carrying out the provisions of such trust indenture or agreement may be treated as part of the cost of a project.\n\n(j) An energy improvement district board may fix, revise, charge and collect rates, rents, fees and charges for the use of and for the services furnished or to be furnished by each project and to contract with any person, partnership, association or corporation, or other body, public or private, in respect thereof. Such rates, rents, fees and charges shall be fixed and adjusted in respect of the aggregate of rates, rents, fees and charges from such project so as to provide funds sufficient with other revenues, if any, to (1) pay the cost of maintaining, repairing and operating the project and each and every portion thereof, to the extent that the payment of such cost has not otherwise been adequately provided for, (2) pay the principal and interest of outstanding revenue bonds of the board issued in respect of such project as the same shall become due and payable, and (3) create and maintain reserves required or provided for in any resolution authorizing, or trust agreement securing, such revenue bonds of the board. Such rates, rents, fees and charges shall not be subject to supervision or regulation by any department, commission, board, body, bureau or agency of this state other than the board. A sufficient amount of the revenues derived in respect of a project, except such part of such revenues as may be necessary to pay the cost of maintenance, repair and operation and to provide reserves and for renewals, replacements, extensions, enlargements and improvements as may be provided for in the resolution authorizing the issuance of any revenue bonds of the board or in the trust agreement securing the same, shall be set aside at such regular intervals as may be provided in such resolution or trust agreement in a sinking or other similar fund which is hereby pledged to, and charged with, the payment of the principal of and the interest on such revenue bonds as the same shall become due, and the redemption price or the purchase price of bonds retired by call or purchase as therein provided. Such pledge shall be valid and binding from the time when the pledge is made; the rates, rents, fees and charges and other revenues or other moneys so pledged and thereafter received by the board shall immediately be subject to the lien of any such pledge, without any physical delivery thereof or further act, and the lien of any such pledge shall be valid and binding as against all parties having claims of any kind in tort, contract or otherwise against the board, irrespective of whether such parties have notice thereof. Neither the resolution nor any trust indenture or agreement by which a pledge is created need be filed or recorded except in the records of the board. The use and disposition of moneys to the credit of such sinking or other similar fund shall be subject to the provisions of the resolution authorizing the issuance of such bonds or of such trust agreement. Except as may otherwise be provided in such resolution or such trust indenture or agreement, such sinking or other similar fund shall be a fund for all revenue bonds issued to finance a project of such board without distinction or priority of one over another.\n\n(k) All moneys received by the board pursuant to sections 32-80a to 32-80c , inclusive, whether as proceeds from the sale of bonds or as revenues, shall be deemed to be trust funds to be held and applied solely as provided pursuant to this subsection and subsection (j) of this section.\n\n(l) Any holder of bonds, notes, certificates or other evidences of borrowing issued pursuant to subsection (b) of section 32-80a or of any of the coupons appertaining thereto and the trustee under any trust indenture or agreement, except to the extent the right may be restricted by such trust indenture or agreement, may, either at law or in equity, by suit, action, injunction, mandamus or other proceedings, protect and enforce any and all rights under the provisions of the general statutes or granted by sections 32-80a to 32-80c , inclusive, or under such trust indenture or agreement or the resolution authorizing the issuance of such bonds, notes or certificates, and may enforce and compel the performance of all duties required by said sections or by such trust indenture or agreement or solution to be performed by the energy improvement district board or by any officer or agent thereof, including the fixing, charging and collection of fees, rents and other charges."

              "(d) A municipality, governmental unit or person may enter into and perform any lease or other agreement with any energy improvement district board for the lease or other agreement with any municipality, governmental unit or person of all or any part of any energy improvement district distributed resource facility or facilities.

The principal amount of bonds so guaranteed and included in gross debt shall be deducted and is declared to be and to constitute a deduction from such gross debt under and for all the purposes of subsection (b) of said section 7-374 , (1) from and after the time of issuance of said bonds until the end of the fiscal year beginning next after the completion of acquisition and construction of the distributed resource facility to be financed from the proceeds of such bonds, and (2) during any subsequent fiscal year if the revenues of the board in the preceding fiscal year are sufficient to pay its expenses of operation and maintenance in such year and all amounts payable in such year on account of the principal and interest on all such guaranteed bonds, all bonds of the municipality issued as provided in this subsection and all bonds of the energy improvement district board issued under subsection (b) of section 32-80a .",

              "(h) All property of an energy improvement district board shall be exempt from levy and sale by virtue of an execution and no execution or other judicial process shall issue against the same nor shall any judgment against the board be a charge or lien upon its property, provided nothing in this subsection shall apply to or limit the rights of the holder of any bonds to pursue any remedy for the enforcement of any pledge or lien given by the board on its facility revenues or other moneys.",
              "(i) An energy improvement district board and the municipality in which any property of the board is located may enter into agreements with respect to the payment by the board to such municipality of annual sums of money in lieu of taxes on such property in such amount as may be agreed upon between the board and the municipality. The board may make, and the municipality may accept, such payments and apply them in the manner in which taxes may be applied in such municipality, provided no such annual payment with respect to any parcel of such property shall exceed the amount of taxes paid thereon for the taxable year immediately prior to the time of its acquisition by the board."

As part of the guarantee of the municipality for payment of principal and interest on the bonds, the municipality may pledge to and agree with the owners of bonds issued under this chapter and with those persons who may enter into contracts with the municipality or the board or any successor agency pursuant to the provisions of this chapter that it will not limit or alter the rights thereby vested in the bond owners, the board or any contracting party until such bonds, together with the interest thereon, are fully met and discharged and such contracts are fully performed on the part of the municipality or the board, provided nothing in this subsection shall preclude such limitation or alteration if and when adequate provisions shall be made by law for the protection of the owners of such bonds of the municipality or the board or those entering into such contracts with the municipality or the board. The board is authorized to include this pledge and undertaking for the municipality in such bonds or contracts. To the extent provided in such agreement or agreements, the obligations of the municipality thereunder shall be obligatory upon the municipality and the inhabitants and property thereof, and thereafter the municipality shall appropriate in each year during the term of such agreement, and there shall be available on or before the date when the same are payable, an amount of money that, together with other revenue available for such purpose, shall be sufficient to pay such principal and interest guaranteed by it and payable thereunder in that year, and there shall be included in the tax levy for each such year in an amount that, together with other revenues available for such purpose, shall be sufficient to meet such appropriation. Any such agreement shall be valid, binding and enforceable against the municipality if approved by action of the legislative body of such municipality. Any such guaranty of bonds of the board may be made, and any resolution authorizing such guaranty may be adopted, notwithstanding any statutory debt or other limitations, but the principal amount of bonds so guaranteed shall, after their issuance, be included in the gross debt of such municipality for the purpose of determining the indebtedness of such municipality under subsection (b) of section 7-374 . The principal amount of bonds so guaranteed and included in gross debt shall be deducted and is declared to be and to constitute a deduction from such gross debt under and for all the purposes of subsection (b) of said section 7-374 , (1) from and after the time of issuance of said bonds until the end of the fiscal year beginning next after the completion of acquisition and construction of the distributed resource facility to be financed from the proceeds of such bonds, and (2) during any subsequent fiscal year if the revenues of the board in the preceding fiscal year are sufficient to pay its expenses of operation and maintenance in such year and all amounts payable in such year on account of the principal and interest on all such guaranteed bonds, all bonds of the municipality issued as provided in this subsection and all bonds of the energy improvement district board issued under subsection (b) of section 32-80a .\n\n(g) Any energy improvement district board may pledge or assign any lease or other agreement, and any instruments making or evidencing the same to secure its bonds and thereafter may not modify such leases, agreements or instruments except as provided by the terms of such lease, agreement or instrument.\n\n(h) All property of an energy improvement district board shall be exempt from levy and sale by virtue of an execution and no execution or other judicial process shall issue against the same nor shall any judgment against the board be a charge or lien upon its property, provided nothing in this subsection shall apply to or limit the rights of the holder of any bonds to pursue any remedy for the enforcement of any pledge or lien given by the board on its facility revenues or other moneys.\n\n(i) An energy improvement district board and the municipality in which any property of the board is located may enter into agreements with respect to the payment by the board to such municipality of annual sums of money in lieu of taxes on such property in such amount as may be agreed upon between the board and the municipality. The board may make, and the municipality may accept, such payments and apply them in the manner in which taxes may be applied in such municipality, provided no such annual payment with respect to any parcel of such property shall exceed the amount of taxes paid thereon for the taxable year immediately prior to the time of its acquisition by the board."

Such company shall permanently or temporarily readjust, relocate or remove the public service facility promptly in accordance with such order, provided an equitable share of the cost of such readjustment, relocation or removal, including the cost of installing and constructing a facility of equal capacity in a new location, shall be borne by the implementing agency. Such equitable share shall be fifty per cent of such cost after the deduction hereinafter provided. In establishing the equitable share of the cost to be borne by the implementing agency, there shall be deducted from the cost of the readjusted, relocated or removed facilities a sum based on a consideration of the value of materials salvaged from existing installations, the cost of the original installation, the life expectancy of the original facility and the unexpired term of such life use.

The court or the judge, after causing notice of the pendency of such application to be given to the other party, shall appoint a state referee to make such determination. The referee, having given at least ten days' notice to the interested parties of the time and place of the hearing, shall hear both parties, take such testimony as he may deem material and thereupon determine the amount of the cost to be borne by the implementing agency. The referee shall immediately report the amount to the court. If the report is accepted by the court, such determination shall, subject to right of appeal as in civil actions, be conclusive upon such parties.",
              "(h) After approval of the development plan pursuant to sections 32-220 to 32-234 , inclusive, the implementing agency may by purchase, lease, exchange or gift acquire or rent real property necessary or appropriate for the project as identified in the development plan and real property and interests therein for rights-of-way and other easements to and from the project area.",

Not less than ten days before the date of the hearing, the implementing agency shall send, by first class mail, notice of the time, place and subject of the hearing to the owners of record of the real property and to all owners of real property within one hundred feet of the real property to be acquired by condemnation.",
              "(3) (A) No parcel of real property may be acquired by condemnation under this section except by approval by vote of at least two-thirds of the members of the legislative body of the municipality, or, in the case of a municipality for which the legislative body is a town meeting or a representative town meeting, the board of selectmen. Such approval shall be by (i) separate vote on each parcel of real property to be acquired, or (ii) a vote on one or more groups of such parcels, provided each parcel to be acquired is identified for the purposes of a vote on a group of such parcels under this subparagraph. The legislative body or the board of selectmen, as the case may be, shall not approve the use of condemnation by the implementing agency unless the legislative body or board of selectmen has (I) considered the benefits to the public and any private entity that will result from the municipal development project and determined that the public benefits outweigh any private benefits, (II) determined that the current use of the real property cannot be feasibly integrated into the overall development plan, and (III) determined that the acquisition of the real property by condemnation is reasonably necessary to successfully achieve the objectives of the development plan.",
              "(B) The municipality shall cause notice of any approved acquisition by condemnation under this subdivision to be published in a newspaper having a substantial circulation in the municipality not more than ten days after such approval.",
              "(C) (i) The implementing agency shall acquire any property identified in the plan as property to be acquired by condemnation by a date that is five years after the date the first property is acquired by condemnation under the plan unless the implementing agency approves an extension of the time for acquisition, except that no property may be acquired by condemnation under the plan more than ten years after the first property is acquired by condemnation under the plan.",
              "(ii) With respect to a development plan for a project that is funded in whole or in part by federal funds, the provisions of this subparagraph shall not apply to the extent that such provisions are prohibited by federal law.",
              "(4) The owner-occupant of property acquired by condemnation under this section may file an application in the superior court for the judicial district in which the municipality is located to enjoin the acquisition of such property. The court may issue such injunction if the court finds that the implementing agency or municipality failed to comply with the requirements of this section. The filing of an application to enjoin the acquisition of property by condemnation, in a court of competent jurisdiction, shall toll the five-year period or ten-year period set forth in subparagraph (C) of subdivision (3) of this subsection with respect to such property until the date a final judgment is entered in any such action, or any appeal thereof, whichever date is later.",
              "(j) (1) With respect to real property acquired by condemnation pursuant to this section on or after June 25, 2007, if the municipality does not use the real property for the purpose for which it was acquired or for some other public use and seeks to sell the property, the municipality shall first offer the real property for sale pursuant to subdivision (2) of this subsection to the person from whom the real property was acquired, or heirs of the person designated pursuant to subdivision (2) of this subsection, if any, for a price not to exceed the lesser of (A) the amount paid by the implementing agency to acquire the property, or (B) the fair market value of the property at the time of any sale under this subsection. After the municipality provides notice pursuant to subdivision (2) of this subsection, the municipality may not sell such property to a third party unless the municipality has permitted the person or named heirs six months during which to exercise the right to purchase the property, and an additional six months to finalize the purchase if the person or named heirs provide the municipality with notice of intent to purchase the property within the initial six-month period.",
              "(2) For the purposes of any offer of sale pursuant to this subsection, the municipality shall provide a form to any person whose property is acquired by condemnation pursuant to this section to permit such person to provide an address for notice of sale to be sent, or to provide the name and address of an agent to receive such notice. Such form shall be designed to permit the person to designate heirs of the person who shall be eligible to purchase such property pursuant to this subsection. The person or agent shall update information in the form in writing. If the person or agent does not provide or update the information in the form in a manner that permits the municipality to send notice of sale pursuant to this subsection, no such notice shall be required.",
              "(3) With respect to a development plan for a project that is funded in whole or in part by federal funds, the provisions of this subsection shall not apply to the extent that such provisions are prohibited by federal law."

Any action taken in connection with the preparation and adoption of such plan shall be deemed effective to the extent such action satisfies the requirements of said sections.\n\n(c) (1) No plan shall be adopted unless the planning commission of the municipality finds that the plan is in accord with the plan of development, if any, for the municipality and the regional council of governments organized under section 4-124j for the region within which such municipality is located finds that such plan is in accord with the plan of development, if any, for such region. If the regional council of governments fails to make a finding concerning the plan within thirty-five days of receipt thereof, by such council, it shall be presumed that such council does not disapprove of the plan. The implementing agency shall hold at least one public hearing on the plan and shall cause notice of the time, place, and subject of any public hearing to be published at least once in a newspaper of general circulation in the municipality not less than one week nor more than three weeks prior to the date of such public hearing. At least thirty-five days prior to the public hearing, the implementing agency shall post the plan on the Internet web site of the implementing agency, if any. Upon adoption of the plan the implementing agency shall submit the plan to the legislative body of the municipality for approval or disapproval. Any approval by the implementing agency and legislative body of the municipality made under this section shall specifically provide for approval of any findings contained therein. After approval of the plan by the legislative body of the municipality, the plan shall be submitted to the commissioner for his approval. If the commissioner requires a substantial modification of the plan as a condition of approval, the plan shall be subject to a public hearing and approval by the implementing agency and the legislative body of the municipality in accordance with the provisions of this subsection.\n\n(2) The plan shall be effective for a period of ten years after the date of approval and may be amended in accordance with this section. The legislative body shall review the plan at least once every ten years after the initial approval, and shall reapprove the plan or an amended plan at least once every ten years after the initial approval in accordance with this section in order for the plan or amended plan to remain in effect. With respect to a development plan for a project that is funded in whole or in part by federal funds, the provisions of this subdivision shall not apply to the extent that such provisions are prohibited by federal law.\n\n(d) The implementing agency shall cause notice of the initial approval of the plan to be published in a newspaper having general circulation in the municipality.\n\n(e) A development plan may be modified at any time by the implementing agency, provided, if modified after the lease or sale of real property in the project area, the lessees or purchasers of such real property or their successor or successors in interest affected by the proposed modification shall consent to such modification. If the proposed modification will substantially alter the development plan as previously approved, the modification shall be subject to the approval of the local legislative body of the municipality and the commissioner in the same manner as approval of the development plan. The municipality may, by vote of its legislative body, abandon the development plan and convey such real property within the boundaries of the project area free of any restriction, obligation or procedure imposed by the plan subject to all other local and state laws, ordinances or regulations, including, but not limited to, any offer of sale required under subsection (i) of this section, if after three years from the date of approval of the plan the implementing agency has not transferred by sale or lease all or any part of the real property acquired in the project area to any person in accordance with the development plan and no grant of financial assistance under sections 32-220 to 32-234 , inclusive, has been given for such project other than for activities related to the planning of the project pursuant to section 32-222 .\n\n(f) The implementing agencies of two or more municipalities may, after approval by each legislative body thereof, jointly initiate a development project if the project area is to be located in one or more of such municipalities. Such implementing agencies, after approval by the commissioner of the development plan for the project if any state aid is to be requested under section 32-223 , may enter into and amend subject to the approval of the commissioner, an agreement to jointly carry out the development plan. Such agreement may include provisions for furnishing municipal services to the project and sharing costs of and revenues from the project, including property tax and rental receipts. The development plan shall include a proposed form of the agreement to be entered into by the municipalities. Each municipality which is a party to an agreement may make appropriations and levy taxes in accordance with the provisions of the general statutes and may issue bonds in accordance with section 32-227 to further its obligations under the agreement.\n\n(g) As used in this subsection, “public service facility” includes any sewer, pipe, main conduit, cable, wire, pole, tower, building or utility appliance owned or operated by an electric distribution, gas, telephone or water company. Whenever an implementing agency determines that the closing of any street or public right-of-way is provided for in a development plan adopted and approved in accordance with sections 32-220 to 32-234 , inclusive, or where the carrying out of such a development plan, including the construction of new improvements, requires the temporary or permanent readjustment, relocation or removal of a public service facility from a street or public right-of-way, the implementing agency shall issue an appropriate order to the company owning or operating such facility. Such company shall permanently or temporarily readjust, relocate or remove the public service facility promptly in accordance with such order, provided an equitable share of the cost of such readjustment, relocation or removal, including the cost of installing and constructing a facility of equal capacity in a new location, shall be borne by the implementing agency. Such equitable share shall be fifty per cent of such cost after the deduction hereinafter provided. In establishing the equitable share of the cost to be borne by the implementing agency, there shall be deducted from the cost of the readjusted, relocated or removed facilities a sum based on a consideration of the value of materials salvaged from existing installations, the cost of the original installation, the life expectancy of the original facility and the unexpired term of such life use. The books and records of the company shall be made available for inspection by the implementing agency to determine the equitable share of the cost of such readjustment, relocation or removal. When any facility is removed from a street or public right-of-way to a private right-of-way, the implementing agency shall not pay for such private right-of-way. If the implementing agency and the company owning or operating such facility cannot agree upon the share of the cost to be borne by the implementing agency, such agency or the company may apply to the superior court for the judicial district within which the street or public right-of-way is situated, or, if the court is not in session, to any judge thereof, for a determination of the cost to be borne by the implementing agency. The court or the judge, after causing notice of the pendency of such application to be given to the other party, shall appoint a state referee to make such determination. The referee, having given at least ten days' notice to the interested parties of the time and place of the hearing, shall hear both parties, take such testimony as he may deem material and thereupon determine the amount of the cost to be borne by the implementing agency. The referee shall immediately report the amount to the court. If the report is accepted by the court, such determination shall, subject to right of appeal as in civil actions, be conclusive upon such parties.\n\n(h) After approval of the development plan pursuant to sections 32-220 to 32-234 , inclusive, the implementing agency may by purchase, lease, exchange or gift acquire or rent real property necessary or appropriate for the project as identified in the development plan and real property and interests therein for rights-of-way and other easements to and from the project area.\n\n(i) (1) The implementing agency may, with the approval of the legislative body of the municipality, and in the name of the municipality, condemn in accordance with section 8-128 to 8-133 , inclusive, any real property necessary or appropriate for the project as identified in the development plan, including real property and interests in land for rights-of-way and other easements to and from the project area, except that no real property may be condemned pursuant to this subsection for the primary purpose of increasing local tax revenue.\n\n(2) The implementing agency shall conduct a public hearing on any proposed acquisition of real property by condemnation pursuant to this subsection. The implementing agency shall cause notice of the time, place and subject of the hearing to be published in a newspaper having a substantial circulation in the municipality not more than ten days before the date set for the hearing. Not less than ten days before the date of the hearing, the implementing agency shall send, by first class mail, notice of the time, place and subject of the hearing to the owners of record of the real property and to all owners of real property within one hundred feet of the real property to be acquired by condemnation.\n\n(3) (A) No parcel of real property may be acquired by condemnation under this section except by approval by vote of at least two-thirds of the members of the legislative body of the municipality, or, in the case of a municipality for which the legislative body is a town meeting or a representative town meeting, the board of selectmen. Such approval shall be by (i) separate vote on each parcel of real property to be acquired, or (ii) a vote on one or more groups of such parcels, provided each parcel to be acquired is identified for the purposes of a vote on a group of such parcels under this subparagraph. The legislative body or the board of selectmen, as the case may be, shall not approve the use of condemnation by the implementing agency unless the legislative body or board of selectmen has (I) considered the benefits to the public and any private entity that will result from the municipal development project and determined that the public benefits outweigh any private benefits, (II) determined that the current use of the real property cannot be feasibly integrated into the overall development plan, and (III) determined that the acquisition of the real property by condemnation is reasonably necessary to successfully achieve the objectives of the development plan.\n\n(B) The municipality shall cause notice of any approved acquisition by condemnation under this subdivision to be published in a newspaper having a substantial circulation in the municipality not more than ten days after such approval.\n\n(C) (i) The implementing agency shall acquire any property identified in the plan as property to be acquired by condemnation by a date that is five years after the date the first property is acquired by condemnation under the plan unless the implementing agency approves an extension of the time for acquisition, except that no property may be acquired by condemnation under the plan more than ten years after the first property is acquired by condemnation under the plan.\n\n(ii) With respect to a development plan for a project that is funded in whole or in part by federal funds, the provisions of this subparagraph shall not apply to the extent that such provisions are prohibited by federal law.\n\n(4) The owner-occupant of property acquired by condemnation under this section may file an application in the superior court for the judicial district in which the municipality is located to enjoin the acquisition of such property. The court may issue such injunction if the court finds that the implementing agency or municipality failed to comply with the requirements of this section. The filing of an application to enjoin the acquisition of property by condemnation, in a court of competent jurisdiction, shall toll the five-year period or ten-year period set forth in subparagraph (C) of subdivision (3) of this subsection with respect to such property until the date a final judgment is entered in any such action, or any appeal thereof, whichever date is later.\n\n(j) (1) With respect to real property acquired by condemnation pursuant to this section on or after June 25, 2007, if the municipality does not use the real property for the purpose for which it was acquired or for some other public use and seeks to sell the property, the municipality shall first offer the real property for sale pursuant to subdivision (2) of this subsection to the person from whom the real property was acquired, or heirs of the person designated pursuant to subdivision (2) of this subsection, if any, for a price not to exceed the lesser of (A) the amount paid by the implementing agency to acquire the property, or (B) the fair market value of the property at the time of any sale under this subsection. After the municipality provides notice pursuant to subdivision (2) of this subsection, the municipality may not sell such property to a third party unless the municipality has permitted the person or named heirs six months during which to exercise the right to purchase the property, and an additional six months to finalize the purchase if the person or named heirs provide the municipality with notice of intent to purchase the property within the initial six-month period.\n\n(2) For the purposes of any offer of sale pursuant to this subsection, the municipality shall provide a form to any person whose property is acquired by condemnation pursuant to this section to permit such person to provide an address for notice of sale to be sent, or to provide the name and address of an agent to receive such notice. Such form shall be designed to permit the person to designate heirs of the person who shall be eligible to purchase such property pursuant to this subsection. The person or agent shall update information in the form in writing. If the person or agent does not provide or update the information in the form in a manner that permits the municipality to send notice of sale pursuant to this subsection, no such notice shall be required.\n\n(3) With respect to a development plan for a project that is funded in whole or in part by federal funds, the provisions of this subsection shall not apply to the extent that such provisions are prohibited by federal law."

              "(a) For the purpose of carrying out or administering a municipal or business development project, (1) a municipality, acting by and through its implementing agency, may, subject to the limitations and procedures set forth in this section, issue from time to time bonds of the municipality, and (2) Connecticut Innovations, Incorporated may, upon a resolution adopted by the legislative body of the municipality, issue from time to time bonds which, in either case, are payable solely or in part from and secured by: (A) A pledge of and lien upon any or all of the income, proceeds, revenues and property of development projects, including the proceeds of grants, loans, advances or contributions from the federal government, the state or other source, including financial assistance furnished by the municipality or any other public body pursuant to sections 32-220 to 32-234 , inclusive; (B) taxes or payments in lieu of taxes, or both, in whole or in part, allocated to and paid into a special fund of the municipality or Connecticut Innovations, Incorporated pursuant to the provisions of subsection (c) of this section; or (C) any combination of the methods in subparagraphs (A) and (B) of this subdivision. Any bonds payable and secured as provided in this subsection shall be authorized by, and the appropriation of the proceeds thereof approved by and subject to, a resolution adopted by the legislative body of the municipality, notwithstanding the provisions of any other statute, local law or charter governing the authorization and issuance of bonds and the appropriation of the proceeds thereof generally by the municipality. No such resolution shall be adopted until after a public hearing has been held upon such authorization. Notice of such hearing shall be published not less than five days prior to such hearing in a newspaper having a general circulation in the municipality. Any such bonds of a municipality or Connecticut Innovations, Incorporated shall be issued and sold in such manner; bear interest at such rate or rates, including variable rates; provide for the payment of interest on such dates, whether before or at maturity; be issued at, above or below par; mature at such time or times not exceeding thirty years from their date; have such rank or priority; be payable in such medium of payment; be issued in such form, including, without limitation, registered or book-entry form; carry such registration and transfer privileges and be made subject to purchase or redemption before maturity at such price or prices and under such terms and conditions, including the condition that such bonds be subject to purchase or redemption on the demand of the owner thereof; and contain such other terms and particulars as the legislative body of the municipality or the officers delegated such authority by the legislative body of the municipality shall determine. Any such bonds of Connecticut Innovations, Incorporated shall be issued and sold in the manner and subject to the general terms and provisions of law applicable to issuance of bonds by Connecticut Innovations, Incorporated, except that the provisions of subsection (b) of section 32-23j shall not apply. The proceedings under which bonds are authorized to be issued may, subject to the provisions of indenture or to any other depository agreement, provide for the method of disbursement thereof, with such safeguards and restrictions as it may determine. Any pledge made by the municipality or Connecticut Innovations, Incorporated for bonds issued as provided in this subsection shall be valid and binding from the time when the pledge is made, and any revenues or other receipts, funds or moneys so pledged and thereafter received by the municipality or Connecticut Innovations, Incorporated shall be subject to the lien of such pledge without any physical delivery thereof or further act. The lien of any such pledge shall be valid and binding as against all parties having claims of any kind in tort, contract or otherwise against the municipality or Connecticut Innovations, Incorporated, irrespective of whether such parties have notice of such lien. Neither the resolution nor any other instrument by which a pledge is created need be recorded. All expenses incurred in carrying out such financing may be treated as project costs. Such bonds shall not be included in computing the aggregate indebtedness of the municipality, provided, if such bonds are made payable, in whole or in part, from funds contracted to be advanced by the municipality, the aggregate amount of such funds not yet appropriated to such purpose shall be included in computing the aggregate indebtedness of the municipality. As used in this section, “bonds” means any bonds, including refunding bonds, notes, temporary notes, interim certificates, debentures or other obligations. Temporary notes issued in accordance with this subsection in anticipation of the receipt of the proceeds of bond issues may be issued for a period of not more than five years, and notes issued for a shorter period of time may be renewed by the issue of other notes, provided the period from the date of the original notes to the maturity of the last notes issued in renewal thereof shall not exceed five years. For purposes of this section, references to Connecticut Innovations, Incorporated shall include any subsidiary of Connecticut Innovations, Incorporated established pursuant to subsection (l) of section 32-11a .*",
              "(b) For the purpose of carrying out or administering a municipal or business development project, a municipality or its implementing agency may accept grants, advances, loans or other financial assistance from the federal government, the state or other source and may do any and all things necessary or desirable to secure such financial aid. To assist any project located in the area in which it is authorized to act, any public body, including the state, or any city, town, borough, authority, district, subdivision or agency of the state, may, upon such terms as it determines, furnish service or facilities, provide property, lend or contribute funds, and take any other action of a character which it is authorized to perform for other purposes. To obtain funds for the temporary and definitive financing of any project, a municipality or implementing agency may, in addition to other action authorized under this act or other law, issue its general obligation bonds, notes, temporary notes or other obligations secured by a pledge of the municipality's full faith and credit. Such bonds, notes, temporary notes and other obligations shall be authorized in accordance with the requirements for the authorization of such obligations generally by the municipality and the authorization, issuance and sale thereof shall be subject to the limitations contained in the general statutes, including provisions on the limitation of the aggregate indebtedness of the municipality. Notwithstanding the provisions of sections 7-264 , 7-378 and 7-378a , and any other public or special act or charter or bond ordinance or bond resolution which limits the issuance or renewal of temporary notes issued in anticipation of the receipt of the proceeds of bond issues to a period of time of less than five years from the date of the original notes or requires a reduction in the principal amount of such notes or renewal notes prior to the fifth anniversary of the date of the original notes, such temporary notes may be issued for a period of not more than five years, and notes issued for a shorter period of time may be renewed by the issue of other notes, provided the period from the date of the original notes to the maturity of the last notes issued in renewal thereof shall not exceed five years.",
              "(c) Any development plan authorized under sections 32-220 to 32-234 , inclusive, or any proceedings authorizing the issuance of bonds under said sections may contain a provision that taxes, if any, identified in such plan or such authorizing proceedings and levied upon taxable real or personal property, or both, in a project each year or payments in lieu of such taxes authorized pursuant to chapter 114, or both, by or for the benefit of any one or more municipalities, districts or other public taxing agencies, as the case may be, shall be divided as follows: (1) In each fiscal year that portion of the taxes or payments in lieu of taxes, or both, which would be produced by applying the then current tax rate of each of the taxing agencies to the total sum of the assessed value of the taxable property in the project on the effective date of such adoption or the date of such authorizing proceedings, as the case may be, or on any date between such two dates which is identified in such proceedings, shall be allocated to and when collected shall be paid into the funds of the respective taxing agencies in the same manner as taxes by or for said taxing agencies on all other property are paid; and (2) that portion of the assessed taxes or the payments in lieu of taxes, or both, each fiscal year in excess of the amount referred to in subdivision (1) of this subsection shall be allocated to and when collected shall be paid into a special fund of the municipality or Connecticut Innovations, Incorporated to be used in each fiscal year, first to pay the principal of and interest due in such fiscal year on loans, moneys advanced to, or indebtedness, whether funded, refunded, assumed, or otherwise, incurred by such municipality or Connecticut Innovations, Incorporated to finance or refinance in whole or in part, such project, and then, at the option of the municipality or Connecticut Innovations, Incorporated, to purchase bonds issued for the project which has generated the tax increments or payments in lieu of taxes and then, at the option of the municipality or Connecticut Innovations, Incorporated, to reimburse the provider of or reimbursement party with respect to any guarantee, letter of credit, policy of bond insurance, funds deposited in a debt service reserve fund, funds deposited as capitalized interest or other credit enhancement device used to secure payment of debt service on any bonds, notes or other indebtedness issued pursuant to this section to finance or refinance such project, to the extent of any payments of debt service made therefrom. Unless and until the total assessed valuation of the taxable property in a project exceeds the total assessed value of the taxable property in such project as shown by the last assessment list referred to in subdivision (1) of this subsection, all of the taxes levied and collected and all of the payments in lieu of taxes due and collected upon the taxable property in such project shall be paid into the funds of the respective taxing agencies. When such loans, advances, and indebtedness, if any, and interest thereof, and such debt service reimbursement to the provider of or reimbursement party with respect to such credit enhancement, have been paid in full, all moneys thereafter received from taxes or payments in lieu of taxes, or both, upon the taxable property in such development project shall be paid into the funds of the respective taxing agencies in the same manner as taxes on all other property are paid.",
              "(d) Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (a) or (b) of this section and any other public or special act or charter or bond ordinance or bond resolution which limits the renewal of temporary notes issued pursuant to said subsections in anticipation of the receipt of the proceeds of bond issues to five years from the date of the original notes, any municipality may renew temporary notes in accordance with the provisions of this section for an additional period of not more than four years from the end of such five-year period. The officers or board authorized to issue the bonds or determine the particulars of the bonds may adopt a resolution authorizing the renewal of temporary notes for such additional period under the following conditions: (1) All project grant payments and bond sale proceeds received shall be promptly applied toward project costs or toward payment of such temporary notes as the same shall become due and payable or shall be deposited in trust for such purposes; (2) no later than the end of each period of twelve months after the end of such five-year period a portion of such temporary notes equal to at least one-twentieth of the municipality's estimated cost of the project shall be retired from funds other than project grants or land sale proceeds or note proceeds; (3) the interest on all temporary notes renewed after such five-year period shall be paid from funds other than project grants or land sale proceeds or note proceeds; (4) the principal amount of each bond issue when sold shall be reduced by the amounts spent under subdivision (2) of this section, and the principal of such bonds shall be paid in annual installments commencing no later than one year from the date of issue; and (5) the maximum authorized term of the bonds when sold shall be reduced by not less than the number of months from the end of such five-year period to the date of issue. Any anticipated federal or state project grants or land sale proceeds may be used in computing the municipality's cost of the project. Any municipality in which such resolution is passed shall include in its annual budget or shall otherwise appropriate sufficient funds to make the payments required by subdivisions (2) and (3) of this subsection.",

            "text": "(a) For the purpose of carrying out or administering a municipal or business development project, (1) a municipality, acting by and through its implementing agency, may, subject to the limitations and procedures set forth in this section, issue from time to time bonds of the municipality, and (2) Connecticut Innovations, Incorporated may, upon a resolution adopted by the legislative body of the municipality, issue from time to time bonds which, in either case, are payable solely or in part from and secured by: (A) A pledge of and lien upon any or all of the income, proceeds, revenues and property of development projects, including the proceeds of grants, loans, advances or contributions from the federal government, the state or other source, including financial assistance furnished by the municipality or any other public body pursuant to sections 32-220 to 32-234 , inclusive; (B) taxes or payments in lieu of taxes, or both, in whole or in part, allocated to and paid into a special fund of the municipality or Connecticut Innovations, Incorporated pursuant to the provisions of subsection (c) of this section; or (C) any combination of the methods in subparagraphs (A) and (B) of this subdivision. Any bonds payable and secured as provided in this subsection shall be authorized by, and the appropriation of the proceeds thereof approved by and subject to, a resolution adopted by the legislative body of the municipality, notwithstanding the provisions of any other statute, local law or charter governing the authorization and issuance of bonds and the appropriation of the proceeds thereof generally by the municipality. No such resolution shall be adopted until after a public hearing has been held upon such authorization. Notice of such hearing shall be published not less than five days prior to such hearing in a newspaper having a general circulation in the municipality. Any such bonds of a municipality or Connecticut Innovations, Incorporated shall be issued and sold in such manner; bear interest at such rate or rates, including variable rates; provide for the payment of interest on such dates, whether before or at maturity; be issued at, above or below par; mature at such time or times not exceeding thirty years from their date; have such rank or priority; be payable in such medium of payment; be issued in such form, including, without limitation, registered or book-entry form; carry such registration and transfer privileges and be made subject to purchase or redemption before maturity at such price or prices and under such terms and conditions, including the condition that such bonds be subject to purchase or redemption on the demand of the owner thereof; and contain such other terms and particulars as the legislative body of the municipality or the officers delegated such authority by the legislative body of the municipality shall determine. Any such bonds of Connecticut Innovations, Incorporated shall be issued and sold in the manner and subject to the general terms and provisions of law applicable to issuance of bonds by Connecticut Innovations, Incorporated, except that the provisions of subsection (b) of section 32-23j shall not apply. The proceedings under which bonds are authorized to be issued may, subject to the provisions of indenture or to any other depository agreement, provide for the method of disbursement thereof, with such safeguards and restrictions as it may determine. Any pledge made by the municipality or Connecticut Innovations, Incorporated for bonds issued as provided in this subsection shall be valid and binding from the time when the pledge is made, and any revenues or other receipts, funds or moneys so pledged and thereafter received by the municipality or Connecticut Innovations, Incorporated shall be subject to the lien of such pledge without any physical delivery thereof or further act. The lien of any such pledge shall be valid and binding as against all parties having claims of any kind in tort, contract or otherwise against the municipality or Connecticut Innovations, Incorporated, irrespective of whether such parties have notice of such lien. Neither the resolution nor any other instrument by which a pledge is created need be recorded. All expenses incurred in carrying out such financing may be treated as project costs. Such bonds shall not be included in computing the aggregate indebtedness of the municipality, provided, if such bonds are made payable, in whole or in part, from funds contracted to be advanced by the municipality, the aggregate amount of such funds not yet appropriated to such purpose shall be included in computing the aggregate indebtedness of the municipality. As used in this section, “bonds” means any bonds, including refunding bonds, notes, temporary notes, interim certificates, debentures or other obligations. Temporary notes issued in accordance with this subsection in anticipation of the receipt of the proceeds of bond issues may be issued for a period of not more than five years, and notes issued for a shorter period of time may be renewed by the issue of other notes, provided the period from the date of the original notes to the maturity of the last notes issued in renewal thereof shall not exceed five years. For purposes of this section, references to Connecticut Innovations, Incorporated shall include any subsidiary of Connecticut Innovations, Incorporated established pursuant to subsection (l) of section 32-11a .*\n\n(b) For the purpose of carrying out or administering a municipal or business development project, a municipality or its implementing agency may accept grants, advances, loans or other financial assistance from the federal government, the state or other source and may do any and all things necessary or desirable to secure such financial aid. To assist any project located in the area in which it is authorized to act, any public body, including the state, or any city, town, borough, authority, district, subdivision or agency of the state, may, upon such terms as it determines, furnish service or facilities, provide property, lend or contribute funds, and take any other action of a character which it is authorized to perform for other purposes. To obtain funds for the temporary and definitive financing of any project, a municipality or implementing agency may, in addition to other action authorized under this act or other law, issue its general obligation bonds, notes, temporary notes or other obligations secured by a pledge of the municipality's full faith and credit. Such bonds, notes, temporary notes and other obligations shall be authorized in accordance with the requirements for the authorization of such obligations generally by the municipality and the authorization, issuance and sale thereof shall be subject to the limitations contained in the general statutes, including provisions on the limitation of the aggregate indebtedness of the municipality. Notwithstanding the provisions of sections 7-264 , 7-378 and 7-378a , and any other public or special act or charter or bond ordinance or bond resolution which limits the issuance or renewal of temporary notes issued in anticipation of the receipt of the proceeds of bond issues to a period of time of less than five years from the date of the original notes or requires a reduction in the principal amount of such notes or renewal notes prior to the fifth anniversary of the date of the original notes, such temporary notes may be issued for a period of not more than five years, and notes issued for a shorter period of time may be renewed by the issue of other notes, provided the period from the date of the original notes to the maturity of the last notes issued in renewal thereof shall not exceed five years.\n\n(c) Any development plan authorized under sections 32-220 to 32-234 , inclusive, or any proceedings authorizing the issuance of bonds under said sections may contain a provision that taxes, if any, identified in such plan or such authorizing proceedings and levied upon taxable real or personal property, or both, in a project each year or payments in lieu of such taxes authorized pursuant to chapter 114, or both, by or for the benefit of any one or more municipalities, districts or other public taxing agencies, as the case may be, shall be divided as follows: (1) In each fiscal year that portion of the taxes or payments in lieu of taxes, or both, which would be produced by applying the then current tax rate of each of the taxing agencies to the total sum of the assessed value of the taxable property in the project on the effective date of such adoption or the date of such authorizing proceedings, as the case may be, or on any date between such two dates which is identified in such proceedings, shall be allocated to and when collected shall be paid into the funds of the respective taxing agencies in the same manner as taxes by or for said taxing agencies on all other property are paid; and (2) that portion of the assessed taxes or the payments in lieu of taxes, or both, each fiscal year in excess of the amount referred to in subdivision (1) of this subsection shall be allocated to and when collected shall be paid into a special fund of the municipality or Connecticut Innovations, Incorporated to be used in each fiscal year, first to pay the principal of and interest due in such fiscal year on loans, moneys advanced to, or indebtedness, whether funded, refunded, assumed, or otherwise, incurred by such municipality or Connecticut Innovations, Incorporated to finance or refinance in whole or in part, such project, and then, at the option of the municipality or Connecticut Innovations, Incorporated, to purchase bonds issued for the project which has generated the tax increments or payments in lieu of taxes and then, at the option of the municipality or Connecticut Innovations, Incorporated, to reimburse the provider of or reimbursement party with respect to any guarantee, letter of credit, policy of bond insurance, funds deposited in a debt service reserve fund, funds deposited as capitalized interest or other credit enhancement device used to secure payment of debt service on any bonds, notes or other indebtedness issued pursuant to this section to finance or refinance such project, to the extent of any payments of debt service made therefrom. Unless and until the total assessed valuation of the taxable property in a project exceeds the total assessed value of the taxable property in such project as shown by the last assessment list referred to in subdivision (1) of this subsection, all of the taxes levied and collected and all of the payments in lieu of taxes due and collected upon the taxable property in such project shall be paid into the funds of the respective taxing agencies. When such loans, advances, and indebtedness, if any, and interest thereof, and such debt service reimbursement to the provider of or reimbursement party with respect to such credit enhancement, have been paid in full, all moneys thereafter received from taxes or payments in lieu of taxes, or both, upon the taxable property in such development project shall be paid into the funds of the respective taxing agencies in the same manner as taxes on all other property are paid.\n\n(d) Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (a) or (b) of this section and any other public or special act or charter or bond ordinance or bond resolution which limits the renewal of temporary notes issued pursuant to said subsections in anticipation of the receipt of the proceeds of bond issues to five years from the date of the original notes, any municipality may renew temporary notes in accordance with the provisions of this section for an additional period of not more than four years from the end of such five-year period. The officers or board authorized to issue the bonds or determine the particulars of the bonds may adopt a resolution authorizing the renewal of temporary notes for such additional period under the following conditions: (1) All project grant payments and bond sale proceeds received shall be promptly applied toward project costs or toward payment of such temporary notes as the same shall become due and payable or shall be deposited in trust for such purposes; (2) no later than the end of each period of twelve months after the end of such five-year period a portion of such temporary notes equal to at least one-twentieth of the municipality's estimated cost of the project shall be retired from funds other than project grants or land sale proceeds or note proceeds; (3) the interest on all temporary notes renewed after such five-year period shall be paid from funds other than project grants or land sale proceeds or note proceeds; (4) the principal amount of each bond issue when sold shall be reduced by the amounts spent under subdivision (2) of this section, and the principal of such bonds shall be paid in annual installments commencing no later than one year from the date of issue; and (5) the maximum authorized term of the bonds when sold shall be reduced by not less than the number of months from the end of such five-year period to the date of issue. Any anticipated federal or state project grants or land sale proceeds may be used in computing the municipality's cost of the project. Any municipality in which such resolution is passed shall include in its annual budget or shall otherwise appropriate sufficient funds to make the payments required by subdivisions (2) and (3) of this subsection.\n\nSee Sec. 7-380b re issuance of bonds, notes or other obligations authorized before June 23, 1993."

              "(a) There is created within the corporation the Connecticut Works Guarantee Fund. The corporation may issue or make advance commitments to issue guarantees of loans and guarantees of other investments. No guarantee or commitment to issue a guarantee shall be provided or entered into by the corporation pursuant to this section which would cause the aggregate amount of all such guarantees and commitments then outstanding to exceed four times the sum of the amounts available in the fund plus the amount of any unpaid grants authorized to be made by the Department of Economic and Community Development to the corporation for deposit in the fund which remain available for purposes of the fund pursuant to the bond authorization in section 32-262 , provided the amount of any guarantee shall be measured by the portion of unpaid loan principal, or its equivalent in the case of other investments, which is guaranteed by the corporation and shall exclude for purposes of such limitation the amount of any such guarantee to the extent that the liability of the corporation with respect thereto has been reinsured or otherwise assumed by an eligible financial institution with a long-term credit rating equal to or higher than that of the state. The purposes of such program shall be: (1) To encourage the growth and retention of manufacturing firms and other businesses in the state that are unable to obtain financing under reasonable terms and conditions due to the contraction in liquidity in the banking system; (2) to stimulate the growth and retention of jobs, the development of all geographic regions of the state and the increase in state and municipal tax revenue; and (3) to address concerns with the availability of financing which has been discontinued subsequent to a merger, takeover or liquidation of a financial institution by a federal financial regulatory institution. The corporation shall utilize the authority provided by this section to achieve the maximum creation or retention of jobs, especially high quality, skilled jobs, with the funds available. There shall be deposited in the fund all guarantee fees and all proceeds of collateral and other recoveries with respect to payments made under guarantees and any and all other moneys or assets, other than payments on guarantees issued hereunder, received by the corporation in return for any guarantee provided or offered, whether pursuant to any applicable contract or agreement entered into by the corporation under subsection (i) of this section or otherwise. Amounts in the fund shall be used in accordance with this section to satisfy any valid guarantee claim payable therefrom and may be used for any other purpose determined by the corporation to be in furtherance of any guarantee or any contract or agreement with an eligible financial institution entered into pursuant to this section or determined by the corporation to be necessary or appropriate to protect the interests of the corporation or the fund, including, without limitation, protecting the interests of the corporation in any project during any period of loan delinquency or upon loan default. Any administrative expenses incurred in carrying out the provisions of this section, to the extent not paid by the corporation, shall be paid from the fund. Each payment from the fund for such administrative expenses shall be made by the corporation upon certification by the chairperson of the corporation that the payment is authorized under the provisions of this section, under the applicable rules and regulations of the corporation. Any amounts in the fund not currently needed to meet the obligations of the fund and the expenses of the corporation may be invested in obligations designated by the corporation, and all income from such investments shall become part of the fund.",
              "(b) The corporation may issue to eligible financial institutions, upon such terms and conditions as the corporation may determine, guarantees of loans and guarantees of other investments the proceeds of which will be used for a business purpose whose economic impact will be in this state.",
              "(c) The corporation shall determine which financial institutions are eligible to participate in the guarantee program consistent with any applicable principles set forth in the participation guidelines for the loan guarantee program of the Connecticut Works Fund. The corporation shall encourage the participation of financial institutions of all sizes from all regions of the state.",
              "(d) (1) The corporation may issue guarantees of loans and other investments, consistent with any applicable principles set forth in the eligibility guidelines for the loan guarantee program of the Connecticut Works Fund, for any project used for manufacturing, industrial, research, product warehousing, distribution or other purposes which will create or retain jobs, maintain or diversify industry, including new or emerging technologies, or maintain or increase the tax base. The corporation also may issue guarantees of loans and guarantees of other investments for other purposes if the corporation determines that such loans or other investments will materially contribute to employment in the state by creating high quality jobs, encouraging exportation beyond the state of goods and services, developing new products or services, creating or supporting a secondary market for business loans made within the state or otherwise supporting, contributing to or enhancing activities important to employment levels in the state. The corporation may issue loan guarantees to women-owned businesses and minority business enterprises. As used in this section, “women-owned business” means any business of which fifty-one per cent or more of the capital stock, if any, or assets are owned by a woman who is active in the daily affairs of the business and has the power to direct the management and policies of the business, and “minority business enterprise” has the same meaning as provided in section 4a-60g .",
              "(2) The corporation shall not issue guarantees authorized under this section to guarantee loans for commercial real estate development projects or for passive real estate ownership. The corporation may issue guarantees for projects in which the borrower intends to purchase commercial real estate for use in its principal business operations.",
              "(3) No guarantee shall be issued pursuant to this section for the financing or refinancing of any project unless the corporation determines that the project is otherwise unable to obtain financing in satisfactory amounts or under reasonable terms or conditions or unless the corporation determines that the borrower is unable to start, continue to operate, expand, maintain operations or relocate to this state without such guarantee.",
              "(4) No guarantee shall be issued pursuant to this section for the financing or refinancing of any project which the corporation determines may be financed commercially, upon reasonable terms and conditions, without such a guarantee, and which an eligible financial institution nonetheless has attempted to shift into this program. The corporation shall determine whether a project has been inappropriately diverted into this program consistent with the credit availability principles set forth in any applicable guidelines for the loan guarantee program of the Connecticut Works Fund. The corporation may require the participating institution to submit its loan criteria and such other information as may be appropriate, and in reviewing projects that involve the refinancing of existing loans, may require submission of the classification assigned to that loan by examiners for any federal financial regulatory institution.",
              "(e) (1) The corporation shall maximize the leveraging capability of guarantees under this section to the extent feasible. The amount guaranteed shall not exceed forty per cent of the principal amount of any particular loan or other investment, and the total guarantee amounts for all outstanding loans or other investments guaranteed by the corporation under this section shall not exceed thirty per cent of the total principal amount of all such loans and investments, except that in the case of a loan guarantee extended in participation with the United States Small Business Administration, the amount guaranteed may be up to fifty per cent of the total principal amount of loans to a borrower, and such loan guarantee may be disregarded for purposes of determining compliance with such overall thirty per cent guarantee limitation, provided at least an equal percentage of the total principal amount of the loans to such borrower is guaranteed by the United States Small Business Administration for at least the same term and otherwise on substantially the same basis as the loan guarantee extended by the corporation. The term of any guarantee issued under this section shall not exceed twenty-five years.",
              "(2) No more than ten million dollars of guarantees shall be issued for a single project. No more than ten million dollars of guarantees shall be issued with respect to loans and other investments to any one person or to any entity owned by, controlled by or under common control with such person.",
              "(3) No loan guarantee shall be issued to an eligible financial institution for any loan or other investment to any executive officer or director of such institution, or to any shareholder owning more than five per cent of the outstanding stock of such institution, or any executive officer of any other eligible financial institution or any director or shareholder owning more than five per cent of the outstanding stock of any such institution, or a member of the immediate family of such an executive officer, director or shareholder or to any company or entity controlled by any such persons.",
              "(f) The corporation shall consider all proposals for guarantees submitted by eligible financial institutions consistent with the due diligence principles set forth in any applicable loan presentation guidelines and underwriting considerations for the loan guarantee program of the Connecticut Works Fund. The corporation shall review and periodically update its due diligence principles as appropriate.",
              "(g) To carry out the purposes of this section, the corporation shall have the powers set forth in section 32-23e , provided no provision of section 32-23e shall be construed to limit any power specifically granted to the corporation under this chapter and no provision of this chapter shall be construed to limit any power specifically granted to the corporation under section 32-23e .",
              "(h) The corporation is authorized from time to time to enter into guarantee agreements, reimbursement agreements, participation agreements, collateral sharing agreements, servicing agreements, and any other agreements or contracts with borrowers or recipients of other investments and with eligible financial institutions with respect to the fund and any loan or other investment guarantee thereunder. Any such agreement or contract, and any procedure of the corporation, may contain terms, provisions or conditions necessary or desirable in connection with the program subject to the requirements established by this section, including without limitation, terms, provisions and conditions relating to loan documentation, review and approval procedures, origination and servicing rights and responsibilities, default conditions, procedures and obligations, the payment of guarantee fees, the giving of notice, claim procedures, the sources of payment for claims, the priority of competing claims for payment, the release or termination of loan security and borrower liability, the timing of payment, the maintenance and disposition of projects and the use of amounts received during periods of loan delinquency or upon default, and any other provisions concerning the rights of guaranteed parties or conditions to the payment of guarantees. Any fees for guarantees issued under the provisions of this section may be determined on such basis, be payable by such person, in such amounts and at such times as the corporation shall determine, and the amount of the fees need not be uniform among the various guarantees. The agreements or contracts may be executed on an individual, group or master contract basis with eligible financial institutions.",
              "(i) Any guarantee made by the corporation under the authorization of this section shall provide that claims payable under such guarantee shall first be paid from any amounts readily available in the fund before any amounts available from the bond authorization contained in section 32-262 are utilized for claim payment. The faith and credit of the state is hereby pledged, pursuant to said bond authorization and in accordance with section 3-20 , to provide to the fund moneys as and when necessary to make timely payments of all amounts required to be paid under the terms of any guarantee executed by the corporation pursuant to this section, but not in excess of the amount of bonds so authorized by the State Bond Commission for such purpose less the amounts paid by the state for deposit to such fund. The obligation of the corporation to make payments under any such guarantee shall be limited solely to such sources and shall not constitute a debt or liability of the corporation or the state.",
              "(j) Any guarantee executed by the corporation under this section shall be conclusive evidence of eligibility for such guarantee, and the validity of any guarantee so executed or of a commitment to guarantee shall be incontestable in the hands of an eligible financial institution holding such guarantee or commitment from the date of execution and delivery thereof, except for fraud or misrepresentation on the part of such eligible financial institution and, as to commitments to guarantee, noncompliance with the commitment or corporation rules or regulations in force at the time of issuance of the commitment.",
              "(k) As used in this section, the following terms have the following meanings unless the context indicates another meaning and intent:",
              "(1) “Corporation” means Connecticut Innovations, Incorporated created under subsection (a) of section 32-35 ;",

The purposes of such program shall be: (1) To encourage the growth and retention of manufacturing firms and other businesses in the state that are unable to obtain financing under reasonable terms and conditions due to the contraction in liquidity in the banking system; (2) to stimulate the growth and retention of jobs, the development of all geographic regions of the state and the increase in state and municipal tax revenue; and (3) to address concerns with the availability of financing which has been discontinued subsequent to a merger, takeover or liquidation of a financial institution by a federal financial regulatory institution. The corporation shall utilize the authority provided by this section to achieve the maximum creation or retention of jobs, especially high quality, skilled jobs, with the funds available. There shall be deposited in the fund all guarantee fees and all proceeds of collateral and other recoveries with respect to payments made under guarantees and any and all other moneys or assets, other than payments on guarantees issued hereunder, received by the corporation in return for any guarantee provided or offered, whether pursuant to any applicable contract or agreement entered into by the corporation under subsection (i) of this section or otherwise. Amounts in the fund shall be used in accordance with this section to satisfy any valid guarantee claim payable therefrom and may be used for any other purpose determined by the corporation to be in furtherance of any guarantee or any contract or agreement with an eligible financial institution entered into pursuant to this section or determined by the corporation to be necessary or appropriate to protect the interests of the corporation or the fund, including, without limitation, protecting the interests of the corporation in any project during any period of loan delinquency or upon loan default. Any administrative expenses incurred in carrying out the provisions of this section, to the extent not paid by the corporation, shall be paid from the fund. Each payment from the fund for such administrative expenses shall be made by the corporation upon certification by the chairperson of the corporation that the payment is authorized under the provisions of this section, under the applicable rules and regulations of the corporation. Any amounts in the fund not currently needed to meet the obligations of the fund and the expenses of the corporation may be invested in obligations designated by the corporation, and all income from such investments shall become part of the fund.\n\n(b) The corporation may issue to eligible financial institutions, upon such terms and conditions as the corporation may determine, guarantees of loans and guarantees of other investments the proceeds of which will be used for a business purpose whose economic impact will be in this state.\n\n(c) The corporation shall determine which financial institutions are eligible to participate in the guarantee program consistent with any applicable principles set forth in the participation guidelines for the loan guarantee program of the Connecticut Works Fund. The corporation shall encourage the participation of financial institutions of all sizes from all regions of the state.\n\n(d) (1) The corporation may issue guarantees of loans and other investments, consistent with any applicable principles set forth in the eligibility guidelines for the loan guarantee program of the Connecticut Works Fund, for any project used for manufacturing, industrial, research, product warehousing, distribution or other purposes which will create or retain jobs, maintain or diversify industry, including new or emerging technologies, or maintain or increase the tax base. The corporation also may issue guarantees of loans and guarantees of other investments for other purposes if the corporation determines that such loans or other investments will materially contribute to employment in the state by creating high quality jobs, encouraging exportation beyond the state of goods and services, developing new products or services, creating or supporting a secondary market for business loans made within the state or otherwise supporting, contributing to or enhancing activities important to employment levels in the state. The corporation may issue loan guarantees to women-owned businesses and minority business enterprises. As used in this section, “women-owned business” means any business of which fifty-one per cent or more of the capital stock, if any, or assets are owned by a woman who is active in the daily affairs of the business and has the power to direct the management and policies of the business, and “minority business enterprise” has the same meaning as provided in section 4a-60g .\n\n(2) The corporation shall not issue guarantees authorized under this section to guarantee loans for commercial real estate development projects or for passive real estate ownership. The corporation may issue guarantees for projects in which the borrower intends to purchase commercial real estate for use in its principal business operations.\n\n(3) No guarantee shall be issued pursuant to this section for the financing or refinancing of any project unless the corporation determines that the project is otherwise unable to obtain financing in satisfactory amounts or under reasonable terms or conditions or unless the corporation determines that the borrower is unable to start, continue to operate, expand, maintain operations or relocate to this state without such guarantee.\n\n(4) No guarantee shall be issued pursuant to this section for the financing or refinancing of any project which the corporation determines may be financed commercially, upon reasonable terms and conditions, without such a guarantee, and which an eligible financial institution nonetheless has attempted to shift into this program. The corporation shall determine whether a project has been inappropriately diverted into this program consistent with the credit availability principles set forth in any applicable guidelines for the loan guarantee program of the Connecticut Works Fund. The corporation may require the participating institution to submit its loan criteria and such other information as may be appropriate, and in reviewing projects that involve the refinancing of existing loans, may require submission of the classification assigned to that loan by examiners for any federal financial regulatory institution.\n\n(e) (1) The corporation shall maximize the leveraging capability of guarantees under this section to the extent feasible. The amount guaranteed shall not exceed forty per cent of the principal amount of any particular loan or other investment, and the total guarantee amounts for all outstanding loans or other investments guaranteed by the corporation under this section shall not exceed thirty per cent of the total principal amount of all such loans and investments, except that in the case of a loan guarantee extended in participation with the United States Small Business Administration, the amount guaranteed may be up to fifty per cent of the total principal amount of loans to a borrower, and such loan guarantee may be disregarded for purposes of determining compliance with such overall thirty per cent guarantee limitation, provided at least an equal percentage of the total principal amount of the loans to such borrower is guaranteed by the United States Small Business Administration for at least the same term and otherwise on substantially the same basis as the loan guarantee extended by the corporation. The term of any guarantee issued under this section shall not exceed twenty-five years.\n\n(2) No more than ten million dollars of guarantees shall be issued for a single project. No more than ten million dollars of guarantees shall be issued with respect to loans and other investments to any one person or to any entity owned by, controlled by or under common control with such person.\n\n(3) No loan guarantee shall be issued to an eligible financial institution for any loan or other investment to any executive officer or director of such institution, or to any shareholder owning more than five per cent of the outstanding stock of such institution, or any executive officer of any other eligible financial institution or any director or shareholder owning more than five per cent of the outstanding stock of any such institution, or a member of the immediate family of such an executive officer, director or shareholder or to any company or entity controlled by any such persons.\n\n(f) The corporation shall consider all proposals for guarantees submitted by eligible financial institutions consistent with the due diligence principles set forth in any applicable loan presentation guidelines and underwriting considerations for the loan guarantee program of the Connecticut Works Fund. The corporation shall review and periodically update its due diligence principles as appropriate.\n\n(g) To carry out the purposes of this section, the corporation shall have the powers set forth in section 32-23e , provided no provision of section 32-23e shall be construed to limit any power specifically granted to the corporation under this chapter and no provision of this chapter shall be construed to limit any power specifically granted to the corporation under section 32-23e .\n\n(h) The corporation is authorized from time to time to enter into guarantee agreements, reimbursement agreements, participation agreements, collateral sharing agreements, servicing agreements, and any other agreements or contracts with borrowers or recipients of other investments and with eligible financial institutions with respect to the fund and any loan or other investment guarantee thereunder. Any such agreement or contract, and any procedure of the corporation, may contain terms, provisions or conditions necessary or desirable in connection with the program subject to the requirements established by this section, including without limitation, terms, provisions and conditions relating to loan documentation, review and approval procedures, origination and servicing rights and responsibilities, default conditions, procedures and obligations, the payment of guarantee fees, the giving of notice, claim procedures, the sources of payment for claims, the priority of competing claims for payment, the release or termination of loan security and borrower liability, the timing of payment, the maintenance and disposition of projects and the use of amounts received during periods of loan delinquency or upon default, and any other provisions concerning the rights of guaranteed parties or conditions to the payment of guarantees. Any fees for guarantees issued under the provisions of this section may be determined on such basis, be payable by such person, in such amounts and at such times as the corporation shall determine, and the amount of the fees need not be uniform among the various guarantees. The agreements or contracts may be executed on an individual, group or master contract basis with eligible financial institutions.\n\n(i) Any guarantee made by the corporation under the authorization of this section shall provide that claims payable under such guarantee shall first be paid from any amounts readily available in the fund before any amounts available from the bond authorization contained in section 32-262 are utilized for claim payment. The faith and credit of the state is hereby pledged, pursuant to said bond authorization and in accordance with section 3-20 , to provide to the fund moneys as and when necessary to make timely payments of all amounts required to be paid under the terms of any guarantee executed by the corporation pursuant to this section, but not in excess of the amount of bonds so authorized by the State Bond Commission for such purpose less the amounts paid by the state for deposit to such fund. The obligation of the corporation to make payments under any such guarantee shall be limited solely to such sources and shall not constitute a debt or liability of the corporation or the state.\n\n(j) Any guarantee executed by the corporation under this section shall be conclusive evidence of eligibility for such guarantee, and the validity of any guarantee so executed or of a commitment to guarantee shall be incontestable in the hands of an eligible financial institution holding such guarantee or commitment from the date of execution and delivery thereof, except for fraud or misrepresentation on the part of such eligible financial institution and, as to commitments to guarantee, noncompliance with the commitment or corporation rules or regulations in force at the time of issuance of the commitment.\n\n(k) As used in this section, the following terms have the following meanings unless the context indicates another meaning and intent:\n\n(1) “Corporation” means Connecticut Innovations, Incorporated created under subsection (a) of section 32-35 ;\n\n(2) “Eligible financial institution” has the same meaning as provided in subsection (e) of section 32-23d ;\n\n(3) “Loans” means loans, notes, bonds and all other forms of debt financing or extensions of credit, secured or unsecured, including loans for working capital purposes;\n\n(4) “Other investments” means (A) any and all forms of equity financing made by the corporation or an eligible financial institution, (B) any participation or other interest in such equity financing, however evidenced, or (C) any pool or portfolio of, or position in, loans, such equity financing or any combination thereof;\n\n(5) “Person” has the same meaning as provided in subsection (s) of section 32-23d ; and\n\n(6) “State” means the state of Connecticut."

            "text": "(a) As used in this section: (1) “Corporation” means Connecticut Innovations, Incorporated, and (2) “financial institution” means an eligible financial institution, as defined in subsection (e) of section 32-23d , which is approved by the corporation to participate in the program established by this section.\n\n(b) In order to stimulate and encourage the growth and development of the state economy, the Connecticut Capital Access Fund is created to provide portfolio insurance to participating financial institutions to assist them in making loans that are somewhat riskier than conventional loans. The insurance shall be based on a portfolio insurance mechanism applicable to loans enrolled by a financial institution in the program, rather than loans by loan guarantees. The state, acting through Connecticut Innovations, Incorporated, shall enter into a participation agreement with each financial institution approved to participate in the program. A participation agreement entered into by the corporation and a financial institution shall establish a separate loan loss reserve account within such financial institution or a third-party financial institution approved by Connecticut Innovations, Incorporated, owned and controlled by Connecticut Innovations, Incorporated, but earmarked to cover losses on loans enrolled by that financial institution in the program. A separate loan loss reserve account shall be established for each participating financial institution. Each time a financial institution enrolls a loan in the program, payments shall be made into the earmarked loan loss reserve account by the borrower, financial institution and the corporation, in amounts consistent with the provisions of the participation agreement. The financial institution shall be allowed to recover the cost of its payment from the borrower.\n\n(c) To carry out the purposes of this section, the corporation shall have those powers set forth in section 32-23 . The corporation shall also have the power to take all reasonable steps and exercise all available remedies necessary or desirable to protect the obligations or interests of the corporation including, but not limited to, the purchase or redemption in foreclosure proceedings, bankruptcy proceedings or in other judicial proceedings of any property on which it holds a mortgage or other lien or in which it has an interest, and for such purposes payment may be made from the Connecticut Capital Access Fund.\n\n(d) Approval of loans for which payments may be made into an account established under this section shall be within the sole discretion of the financial institution making the loan except that such loans shall comply with the requirements specified in the participation agreement.\n\n(e) The corporation shall adopt written procedures in accordance with section 1-121 for implementing the program. Such written procedures shall include the form of participation agreement which shall set forth procedures for use of the program and the rights and responsibilities of participating financial institutions and the corporation. The participation agreement shall require that loans enrolled in the program shall be for a business purpose in the state and shall not be used for residential housing, passive real estate ownership, an insider transaction or to refinance a prior loan by the financial institution which was not covered under the program, except that if new funds are provided to a borrower, an amount equal to the amount of the new funds may be covered under the program.\n\n(f) (1) For the purposes described in subdivision (2) of this subsection, the State Bond Commission shall have the power, from time to time, to authorize the issuance of bonds of the state in one or more series and in principal amounts not exceeding in the aggregate five million dollars.\n\n(2) The proceeds of the sale of said bonds, to the extent of the amount stated in subdivision (1) of this subsection, shall be used by the Department of Economic and Community Development to make grants to Connecticut Innovations, Incorporated for deposit in the Connecticut Capital Access Fund to be used for the purposes authorized under this section and section 32-341 .\n\n(3) All provisions of section 3-20 , or the exercise of any right or power granted thereby which are not inconsistent with the provisions of this section are hereby adopted and shall apply to all bonds authorized by the State Bond Commission pursuant to this section, and temporary notes in anticipation of the money to be derived from the sale of any such bonds so authorized may be issued in accordance with said section 3-20 and from time to time renewed. Such bonds shall mature at such time or times not exceeding twenty years from their respective dates as may be provided in or pursuant to the resolution or resolutions of the State Bond Commission authorizing such bonds. None of said bonds shall be authorized except upon a finding by the State Bond Commission that there has been filed with it a request for such authorization, which is signed by or on behalf of the Secretary of the Office of Policy and Management and states such terms and conditions as said commission, in its discretion, may require. Said bonds issued pursuant to this section shall be general obligations of the state and the full faith and credit of the state of Connecticut are pledged for the payment of the principal of and interest on said bonds as the same become due, and accordingly and as part of the contract of the state with the holders of said bonds, appropriation of all amounts necessary for punctual payment of such principal and interest is hereby made, and the Treasurer shall pay such principal and interest as the same become due."

              "(d) Upon receiving an application for participation in the tax incremental financing program and any supporting information, the chief executive officer of the corporation shall make a preliminary determination as to whether a proposed project may be eligible for participation in the program.",
              "(e) (1) The corporation shall review each application that has been preliminarily determined to be eligible under subsection (d) of this section. In reviewing an application, the corporation shall obtain such additional information as may be necessary to make a final determination as to whether the project is eligible for participation in the program, whether the project is economically viable with use of the tax incremental financing mechanism, the effects of the project on the municipality and whether the project would provide net benefits to economic development and employment opportunity in the state. The corporation may require the project sponsor to submit such additional information as may be necessary to evaluate the application.",
              "(2) The corporation shall retain such financial advisors and other experts as it deems appropriate to conduct an independent financial assessment of the application and supporting information, including, in particular, the amount of the incremental hotel taxes, or, if applicable, the incremental sales and admissions, cabaret and dues taxes to be generated by the project, whether the project will be economically viable and whether the bonds will be self-sustaining.",
              "(3) The corporation shall prepare a revenue impact assessment that estimates the incremental hotel taxes or, if applicable, the incremental sales and admissions, cabaret and dues taxes that would be generated by the project, the state and local revenues that would be foregone as a result of the project, all state and local revenues that would be generated by the project and the economic benefits that would likely result from construction of the project, including revenue effects of such economic benefits.",

              "(B) If such project uses incremental sales and admissions, cabaret and dues taxes, the notice required pursuant to subparagraph (A) of this subdivision shall not be required, but the procedure in subdivision (6) of subsection (f) of this section shall be followed after the board of directors of the corporation has given approval to such project.",
              "(f) (1) Upon consideration of the application, the results of the independent financial assessment, the revenue impact assessment and any additional information that the board of directors of the corporation requires concerning a proposed project, such board of directors shall determine whether to approve the project for participation in the tax incremental financing program and, if so, the amount and type of bonds the corporation shall issue to support the approved project, the purposes for which the funds generated by sale of the bonds may be applied and the amount of the incremental sales and admissions, cabaret and dues taxes that shall be annually allocated to pay principal and interest on the bonds to be issued for the project. The amounts so allocated shall not exceed the estimated amount of incremental taxes to be collected, except that in the case of retail shopping center projects, the amount of incremental sales allocated to calculating incremental sales taxes shall not exceed thirty per cent of gross sales directly associated with the project. From the amount of incremental taxes so allocated by the corporation, the amount required for payment of principal and interest on the bonds issued in accordance with subsection (g) of this section shall be deemed appropriated from the state General Fund, provided, for projects using incremental sales and admissions, cabaret and dues taxes, an amount shall be deemed appropriated only upon final approval of such projects pursuant to subdivision (6) of this subsection.",
              "(2) The corporation may approve a project only if it concludes that: (A) The project is an eligible project; (B) the incremental hotel taxes or, if applicable, the incremental sales taxes collected under chapter 219 and the incremental admissions, cabaret and dues taxes collected under chapter 225 that are generated by the project, together with other dedicated sources of financing available to pay debt service on the bonds, will be sufficient to pay interest and principal on the bonds as they come due; (C) the project will be economically viable and will contribute significantly to economic development and employment opportunity in the state; and (D) the direct and indirect economic benefits of the project to the state and the municipality in which it shall be located will be greater than the costs to the state and such municipality.",

              "(4) The approval of a project by the corporation may be combined with the exercise of any of its other powers, including but not limited to, the provision of other forms of financial assistance. The proceeds of the bonds may be combined with any other funds available from state or federal programs, or from investments by the private sector, to support the project.",
              "(5) Upon approving a project, the corporation may require the project sponsor to reimburse the corporation for all or any part of the costs of the independent financial assessment conducted in reviewing the application and any other related costs incurred.",

Financial assistance by the corporation for the proposed project shall be in accordance with the proposed financial assistance as approved or modified by the committees.",
              "(g) (1) The corporation may issue one or more series of bonds in accordance with the provisions of chapter 579, to the extent not inconsistent with the provisions of this subsection, payable in whole or in part from the incremental taxes allocated and deemed appropriated from the state General Fund under subsection (f) of this section and any amounts contributed by a municipality under subsection (i) of this section, to finance a project approved under this section or to refund bonds previously issued under this section.

              "(2) The issuance of any bonds by the corporation under this section shall be subject to the approval of the State Bond Commission. Upon approving a project, the corporation shall submit the matter to the State Bond Commission for final approval. The State Bond Commission shall not approve any project unless it has received the submission from the corporation at least ten days prior to the meeting at which such project is to be considered. Such submission shall include the information considered by the corporation in approving the project, the independent financial assessment and such other information as the commission deems appropriate. In reaching its decision, the State Bond Commission may consider such information as submitted. After such approval by the Bond Commission, no other approval shall be required for the project.",
              "(h) For such period of time as bonds issued to support an approved project are outstanding, the Treasurer shall make payment of interest and principal on the bonds to the trustee when due, but not exceeding in any fiscal year the amount deemed appropriated pursuant to subsection (f) of this section.",
              "(i) A portion of the proceeds of bonds issued pursuant to this section may be made available to a municipality in which a project is located for the purpose of carrying out or administering a redevelopment plan or other functions authorized under chapter 130 or chapter 132. Such municipality may contribute all or any part of the money specified in subdivision (2) of section 8-134a or subdivision (b) of section 8-192a to the corporation for the payment of principal and interest on the bonds issued by the corporation under this section to support such approved project.

              "(2) Not later than July first in each year that bonds issued to support an approved project are outstanding, the Office of Policy and Management shall retain independent financial experts to conduct an analysis of the financial status of each project approved under this section. The independent financial analysis shall include, but not be limited to, determinations as to whether the incremental hotel taxes or, if applicable, the incremental sales and admissions, cabaret and dues taxes actually generated by the project are equal to the estimates made at the time the project was approved, whether the project is economically viable and whether the bonds issued are self-sustaining with the incremental taxes actually collected and other financing sources dedicated to repayment of the bonds. The corporation shall require the project sponsor to reimburse the Office of Policy and Management for the costs of such annual analyses. The results of such analyses shall be made available to the president pro tempore of the Senate, the speaker of the House of Representatives, the majority and minority leaders of both houses, and to the chairpersons and ranking members of said committees."

            "text": "(a)(1) There is hereby established a tax incremental financing program, under which the incremental hotel taxes collected under subparagraph (H) of subdivision (2) of subsection (a) of section 12-407 , which are generated by a project approved by the corporation under this section may be used to pay the debt service on bonds issued by the corporation to help finance, on a self-sustaining basis, significant economic projects and encourage their location in the state.\n\n(2) The incremental sales taxes collected under chapter 219, other than the sales tax referenced in subdivision (1) of this subsection, and admissions, cabaret and dues taxes collected under chapter 225 which are generated by a project may, subject to approval pursuant to this section by the joint standing committees of the General Assembly having cognizance of matters relating to the Department of Economic and Community Development and finance, revenue and bonding, and the corporation, be used to pay the debt service on bonds issued by the corporation to help finance, on a self-sustaining basis, significant economic projects and encourage their location in the state.\n\n(b) As used in this section: (1) “Corporation” means Connecticut Innovations, Incorporated; and (2) “eligible project” means a large-scale economic development project (A) that may add a substantial amount of new economic activity and employment in the municipality in which it is to be located and surrounding areas, and may generate significant additional tax revenues in the state; (B) for which use of the tax incremental financing mechanism may be necessary to attract the project to locate in the state; (C) which is economically viable and self-sustaining, taking into account the application of the proceeds of the bonds to be issued under the tax incremental financing program; (D) for which the direct and indirect economic benefits to the state and the municipality in which it will be located outweigh the costs of the project; and (E) which is consistent with the strategic development priorities of the state.\n\n(c) Any person, firm or corporation wishing to participate in the tax incremental financing program, or any municipality wishing to obtain tax incremental financing to support a project within its boundaries, may apply to the corporation in accordance with the provisions of this subsection. The application shall contain such information as the corporation may require, which may include information concerning the type of business proposed to be established and its location, the number of jobs to be created or retained and their average wage rates, feasibility studies or business plans for the project and other information necessary to demonstrate its financial viability, the amounts and types of bonds proposed to be issued for the project and the proposed use of the proceeds, information about other sources of financing available to support repayment of the bonds proposed to be issued, including property tax increments to be made available by the municipality, a geographic description of the area surrounding the proposed site of the project and the existing firms doing business in that area, an economic impact assessment of the effects of the project on the municipality, an assessment of the incremental hotel taxes, or, if applicable, the incremental sales and admissions, cabaret and dues taxes to be generated by the project, an analysis of necessary infrastructure development to support the project and any available sources of financing for such infrastructure and other information which demonstrates that the bonds will be self-sustaining from the incremental taxes collected and any amounts made available by a municipality under subsection (i) of this section, and that the project will provide net benefits to the economy and employment opportunity in the state. The corporation shall impose a fee for such application as it deems appropriate. Any costs incurred by the corporation which are associated with such application and are not covered by such fee shall be paid from funds of the corporation which are not otherwise committed or pledged.\n\n(d) Upon receiving an application for participation in the tax incremental financing program and any supporting information, the chief executive officer of the corporation shall make a preliminary determination as to whether a proposed project may be eligible for participation in the program.\n\n(e) (1) The corporation shall review each application that has been preliminarily determined to be eligible under subsection (d) of this section. In reviewing an application, the corporation shall obtain such additional information as may be necessary to make a final determination as to whether the project is eligible for participation in the program, whether the project is economically viable with use of the tax incremental financing mechanism, the effects of the project on the municipality and whether the project would provide net benefits to economic development and employment opportunity in the state. The corporation may require the project sponsor to submit such additional information as may be necessary to evaluate the application.\n\n(2) The corporation shall retain such financial advisors and other experts as it deems appropriate to conduct an independent financial assessment of the application and supporting information, including, in particular, the amount of the incremental hotel taxes, or, if applicable, the incremental sales and admissions, cabaret and dues taxes to be generated by the project, whether the project will be economically viable and whether the bonds will be self-sustaining.\n\n(3) The corporation shall prepare a revenue impact assessment that estimates the incremental hotel taxes or, if applicable, the incremental sales and admissions, cabaret and dues taxes that would be generated by the project, the state and local revenues that would be foregone as a result of the project, all state and local revenues that would be generated by the project and the economic benefits that would likely result from construction of the project, including revenue effects of such economic benefits.\n\n(4) (A) Not later than seventy-two hours before presenting a proposed project to the board of directors of the corporation for final approval, if such project uses incremental hotel taxes, the chief executive officer of the corporation shall give notice of the proposed project and meeting to the president pro tempore and minority leader of the Senate, the speaker and minority leader of the House of Representatives and the chairpersons and ranking members of the joint standing committees of the General Assembly having cognizance of matters relating to finance, revenue and bonding and the Department of Economic and Community Development. Such notice shall include such information about the project, the estimated tax increments and the revenue impact assessment, as may be appropriate, consistent with the protection of any confidential financial information provided by the project sponsor. Any such member of the General Assembly may, by notifying the chief executive officer, request that the board of directors of the corporation defer final consideration of the project for thirty days.\n\n(B) If such project uses incremental sales and admissions, cabaret and dues taxes, the notice required pursuant to subparagraph (A) of this subdivision shall not be required, but the procedure in subdivision (6) of subsection (f) of this section shall be followed after the board of directors of the corporation has given approval to such project.\n\n(f) (1) Upon consideration of the application, the results of the independent financial assessment, the revenue impact assessment and any additional information that the board of directors of the corporation requires concerning a proposed project, such board of directors shall determine whether to approve the project for participation in the tax incremental financing program and, if so, the amount and type of bonds the corporation shall issue to support the approved project, the purposes for which the funds generated by sale of the bonds may be applied and the amount of the incremental sales and admissions, cabaret and dues taxes that shall be annually allocated to pay principal and interest on the bonds to be issued for the project. The amounts so allocated shall not exceed the estimated amount of incremental taxes to be collected, except that in the case of retail shopping center projects, the amount of incremental sales allocated to calculating incremental sales taxes shall not exceed thirty per cent of gross sales directly associated with the project. From the amount of incremental taxes so allocated by the corporation, the amount required for payment of principal and interest on the bonds issued in accordance with subsection (g) of this section shall be deemed appropriated from the state General Fund, provided, for projects using incremental sales and admissions, cabaret and dues taxes, an amount shall be deemed appropriated only upon final approval of such projects pursuant to subdivision (6) of this subsection.\n\n(2) The corporation may approve a project only if it concludes that: (A) The project is an eligible project; (B) the incremental hotel taxes or, if applicable, the incremental sales taxes collected under chapter 219 and the incremental admissions, cabaret and dues taxes collected under chapter 225 that are generated by the project, together with other dedicated sources of financing available to pay debt service on the bonds, will be sufficient to pay interest and principal on the bonds as they come due; (C) the project will be economically viable and will contribute significantly to economic development and employment opportunity in the state; and (D) the direct and indirect economic benefits of the project to the state and the municipality in which it shall be located will be greater than the costs to the state and such municipality.\n\n(3) The corporation shall seek to obtain diversification among the types of projects supported under this program and among the geographic regions in the state in which projects are located.\n\n(4) The approval of a project by the corporation may be combined with the exercise of any of its other powers, including but not limited to, the provision of other forms of financial assistance. The proceeds of the bonds may be combined with any other funds available from state or federal programs, or from investments by the private sector, to support the project.\n\n(5) Upon approving a project, the corporation may require the project sponsor to reimburse the corporation for all or any part of the costs of the independent financial assessment conducted in reviewing the application and any other related costs incurred.\n\n(6) For final approval of any proposed project using incremental sales and admissions, cabaret and dues taxes, the corporation shall submit, in a manner consistent with the protection of any confidential financial information provided by the project sponsor, copies of the application, the independent financial assessment, the revenue impact assessment, and the proposed financial assistance to be offered by the corporation to the proposed project, to the joint standing committees of the General Assembly having cognizance of matters relating to the Department of Economic and Community Development and finance, revenue and bonding for final approval. Not later than forty-five days after said committees' receipt of such proposed project information, said committees shall advise the corporation of their approval or modifications, if any, to such proposed financial assistance. If said committees do not agree, the committee chairpersons shall appoint a committee on conference which shall be comprised of three members from each joint standing committee. At least one member appointed from each committee shall be a member of the minority party. The report of the committee on conference shall be made to each committee, which shall vote to accept or reject the report. The report of the committee on conference may not be amended. If a joint standing committee rejects the report of the committee on conference, the proposed financial assistance shall be deemed approved. If the joint standing committees accept the report, the committee having cognizance of finance, revenue and bonding shall advise the corporation of their approval or modifications, if any, of such proposed financial assistance, provided, if the committees do not act within forty-five days, the proposed financial assistance shall be deemed approved. Financial assistance by the corporation for the proposed project shall be in accordance with the proposed financial assistance as approved or modified by the committees.\n\n(g) (1) The corporation may issue one or more series of bonds in accordance with the provisions of chapter 579, to the extent not inconsistent with the provisions of this subsection, payable in whole or in part from the incremental taxes allocated and deemed appropriated from the state General Fund under subsection (f) of this section and any amounts contributed by a municipality under subsection (i) of this section, to finance a project approved under this section or to refund bonds previously issued under this section. The corporation is authorized to make a grant of all or part of the proceeds of such bonds to any person in connection with the acquisition, construction and equipping of an eligible project, including the expense of the state or any municipality, or any instrumentality or agency of the state or any municipality, in connection therewith. Subject to applicable federal tax law, the corporation may issue such bonds, the interest on which is excludable from gross income for federal income tax purposes, or such bonds, the interest on which is not so excludable. The corporation, when authorizing the issuance of any series of such bonds, shall, in conjunction with the State Treasurer, determine the rate of interest of such bonds, the date or dates of their maturity, the medium of payment, the redemption terms and privileges, whether such bonds shall be sold by negotiated or competitive sale and any and all other terms, covenants and conditions not inconsistent with this section, in connection with the issuance thereof, including but not limited to, the pledging of special capital reserve funds authorized under subsection (b) of section 32-23j .\n\n(2) The issuance of any bonds by the corporation under this section shall be subject to the approval of the State Bond Commission.

Such submission shall include the information considered by the corporation in approving the project, the independent financial assessment and such other information as the commission deems appropriate. In reaching its decision, the State Bond Commission may consider such information as submitted. After such approval by the Bond Commission, no other approval shall be required for the project.\n\n(h) For such period of time as bonds issued to support an approved project are outstanding, the Treasurer shall make payment of interest and principal on the bonds to the trustee when due, but not exceeding in any fiscal year the amount deemed appropriated pursuant to subsection (f) of this section.\n\n(i) A portion of the proceeds of bonds issued pursuant to this section may be made available to a municipality in which a project is located for the purpose of carrying out or administering a redevelopment plan or other functions authorized under chapter 130 or chapter 132. Such municipality may contribute all or any part of the money specified in subdivision (2) of section 8-134a or subdivision (b) of section 8-192a to the corporation for the payment of principal and interest on the bonds issued by the corporation under this section to support such approved project. In exercising such power, such municipalities shall proceed as provided in said chapter 130 or 132, as the case may be, except that the references therein to bonds and bond anticipation notes shall be deemed to refer to the bonds issued by the corporation under this section.\n\n(j) (1) Not later than July first in each year that bonds issued to support an approved project are outstanding, the corporation shall submit a report to the joint standing committees of the General Assembly having cognizance of matters relating to the Department of Economic and Community Development and finance, revenue and bonding with respect to the operations, finances and achievement of the economic development objectives of the projects approved under this section. The corporation shall review and evaluate the progress of each project and shall devise and employ techniques for forecasting and measuring relevant indices of accomplishment of its goals of economic development, including, but not limited to, (A) the actual expenditures compared to original estimated costs, (B) whether there have been significant cost increases over original estimates, (C) the number of jobs created, or to be created, by or as a result of the project, (D) the cost or estimated cost, to the corporation, involved in the creation of those jobs, (E) the amount of private capital investment in, or stimulated by, the project, in proportion to the public funds invested in such project, (F) the number of additional businesses created and associated jobs, and (G) any impact on tourism.\n\n(2) Not later than July first in each year that bonds issued to support an approved project are outstanding, the Office of Policy and Management shall retain independent financial experts to conduct an analysis of the financial status of each project approved under this section. The independent financial analysis shall include, but not be limited to, determinations as to whether the incremental hotel taxes or, if applicable, the incremental sales and admissions, cabaret and dues taxes actually generated by the project are equal to the estimates made at the time the project was approved, whether the project is economically viable and whether the bonds issued are self-sustaining with the incremental taxes actually collected and other financing sources dedicated to repayment of the bonds. The corporation shall require the project sponsor to reimburse the Office of Policy and Management for the costs of such annual analyses. The results of such analyses shall be made available to the president pro tempore of the Senate, the speaker of the House of Representatives, the majority and minority leaders of both houses, and to the chairpersons and ranking members of said committees."

Such person, and any contractor or subcontractor of such person, may use such certificate for the purchase, storage, use or other consumption in this state of qualified data center equipment, services and electricity as set forth in this subsection and each seller of such equipment, services or electricity may rely on such certificate.\n\n(2) The certificate provided pursuant to subdivision (1) of this subsection shall apply, during the time period the agreement is effective, to:\n\n(A) Any additional building or structure at a qualified data center to be developed, acquired, constructed, rehabilitated, renovated, repaired or operated, to house a group of networked computer servers, regardless of whether such development, acquisition, construction, rehabilitation, renovation, repair or operation was contemplated at the time of entering into the agreement; and\n\n(B) Any additional qualified data center equipment, services and electricity acquired or used by such qualified data center after the date the agreement was entered into.\n\n(e) (1) With respect to the exemption from the tax imposed under chapter 203, such exemption shall apply to (A) real property, buildings or structures, located within or at a qualified data center, and (B) enterprise information technology equipment used by a qualified data center.\n\n(2) The exemption under this subsection shall apply, during the time period the agreement entered into pursuant to subsection (c) of this section is effective, to:\n\n(A) Any additional building or structure at a qualified data center that is developed, acquired, constructed, rehabilitated, renovated, repaired or operated, to house a group of networked computer servers, regardless of whether any such development, acquisition, construction, rehabilitation, renovation, repair or operation was contemplated at the time of entering into the agreement;\n\n(B) Any additional enterprise information technology equipment used by a qualified data center that is acquired after the date the agreement was entered into; and\n\n(C) Any additional facility acquired by the owner of a qualified data center for the development, construction, rehabilitation, renovation, repair or operation of a qualified data center, after the date the agreement was entered into, provided such owner enters into a negotiated host municipality fee agreement as required under subdivision (4) of this subsection for each such additional facility.\n\n(3) The Commissioner of Economic and Community Development shall notify each municipality in which such facility is located of any agreement entered into pursuant to this section and shall provide the identity of the person with which the commissioner has entered into such agreement, the date such agreement is effective and the terms of the agreement with respect to the exemption from the tax imposed under chapter 203.\n\n(4) (A) No developer or owner shall commence construction, rehabilitation, renovation or repair of a facility that will be a qualified data center unless such owner has entered into a negotiated host municipality fee agreement with the municipality in which such facility is located. Such owner shall enter into a negotiated host municipality fee agreement for each additional facility that will be a qualified data center that such owner acquires. If a facility is located in contiguous municipalities, such owner shall enter into a negotiated host municipality fee agreement with each such municipality.\n\n(B) Each negotiated host municipality fee agreement shall include provisions for the assessment and payment of the tax under chapter 203 exempted pursuant to the agreement entered into pursuant to subsection (c) of this section, and the rates or amounts of penalties and interest to be imposed thereon, if the legislative body of the municipality in which the qualified data center is located determines that the requirements of the negotiated host municipality fee agreement are not being met or have not been met.\n\n(5) The chief elected official of the municipality in which a qualified data center is located shall notify the qualified data center if the legislative body of such municipality determines the requirements of a negotiated host municipality fee agreement entered into pursuant to subdivision (4) of this subsection are not being met or have not been met. The qualified data center shall cure such noncompliance not later than one hundred eighty days after the date of such notification. If the legislative body of such municipality determines the noncompliance has not been cured, the negotiated host municipality fee agreement shall be terminated.\n\n(6) Upon the termination of a negotiated host municipality fee agreement pursuant to subdivision (5) of this subsection or subdivision (2) of subsection (f) of this section, the qualified data center, the owner of the property on which such qualified data center is located or such owner's successors or assigns shall be subject to the tax imposed under chapter 203 and shall be liable for payment of such taxes on the property that was exempted from such tax, from the date of noncompliance under subdivision (5) of this subsection or the date of termination under subdivision (2) of subsection (f) of this section, as applicable. Such liability shall attach to the property as a charge thereon. Such tax and any related penalty and interest shall be due, payable and collectible as other municipal taxes and subject to the same liens and processes of collection.\n\n(f) (1) If the Commissioner of Economic and Community Development terminates an agreement entered into pursuant to subsection (c) of this section due to the commissioner's determination that the requirements of such agreement or of a qualified data center are not being met or have not been met, the commissioner shall notify the Commissioner of Revenue Services and the chief elected official of the municipality in which the applicable qualified data center is located of such termination.\n\n(2) Any negotiated host municipality fee agreement entered into pursuant to subdivision (4) of subsection (e) of this section by such qualified data center shall be terminated as of the date the agreement entered into pursuant to subsection (c) of this section is terminated. The municipality in which such qualified data center is located may use any remedy authorized by the general statutes to secure the interests of such municipality and recover the amount of any fee, tax, penalty and interest that become due and owing to such municipality due to such termination.\n\n(3) The amount of any taxes under chapter 219, penalty or interest that become due and owing pursuant to the termination by the Commissioner of Economic and Community Development of an agreement entered into pursuant to subsection (c) of this section may be collected by the Commissioner of Revenue Services under the provisions of section 12-35 . The warrant provided under section 12-35 shall be signed by the Commissioner of Revenue Services or the commissioner's authorized agent. The amount of any such tax, penalty or interest shall be a lien on the real estate of the qualified data center from the last day of the month next preceding the due date of such tax until such tax is paid. The Commissioner of Revenue Services may record such lien in the records of any municipality in which the real estate of such qualified data center is located but no such lien shall be enforceable against a bona fide purchaser or qualified encumbrancer of such real estate. When any tax with respect to which a lien has been recorded under the provisions of this subsection has been satisfied, the commissioner shall, upon request of any interested party, issue a certificate discharging such lien, which certificate shall be recorded in the same office in which the lien was recorded. Any action for the foreclosure of such lien shall be brought by the Attorney General in the name of the state in the superior court for the judicial district in which the real estate subject to such lien is located, or, if such property is located in two or more judicial districts, in the superior court for any one such judicial district, and the court may limit the time for redemption or order the sale of such real estate or make such other or further decree as it judges equitable."

For the purpose of evaluation of any such special capital reserve fund, obligations acquired as an investment for any such fund shall be valued at market. Nothing contained in this section shall preclude the authority from establishing and creating other debt service reserve funds in connection with the issuance of bonds or notes of the authority which are not special capital reserve funds. Subject to any agreement or agreements with holders of outstanding notes and bonds of the authority, any amount or amounts allotted and paid to the authority pursuant to this section shall be repaid to the state from moneys of the authority at such time as such moneys are not required for any other of its corporate purposes and in any event shall be repaid to the state on the date one year after all bonds and notes of the authority theretofore issued on the date or dates such amount or amounts are allotted and paid to the authority or thereafter issued, together with interest on such bonds and notes, with interest on any unpaid installments of interest and all costs and expenses in connection with any action or proceeding by or on behalf of the holders thereof, are fully met and discharged.

The court shall affirm the decision of the commissioner unless the court finds that substantial rights of the party appealing such decision have been materially prejudiced because the findings, inferences, conclusions or decisions of the commissioner are in violation of constitutional or statutory provisions, in excess of the statutory authority of the commissioner, made upon unlawful procedure, affected by an error of law, clearly erroneous in view of the reliable, probative and substantial evidence on the whole record, or arbitrary, capricious or characterized by abuse of discretion or clearly unwarranted exercise of discretion.\n\n(5) If the court finds material prejudice, it may sustain the appeal. Upon sustaining an appeal, the court may render a judgment which modifies the decision of the commissioner, orders particular action by the commissioner or orders the commissioner to take such action as may be necessary to effect a particular action and the commissioner may issue a permit consistent with such judgment.\n\n(6) An applicant may file an amended application and the commissioner may consider an amended application for an order, permit or other administrative action following court action."

Notwithstanding any provision of this subsection, the state or a public instrumentality thereof, in the exercise of a governmental function, shall be and remain the owner of the stadium facility and all furniture, fixtures, equipment and other appurtenances purchased as an integral part thereof with the proceeds of bonds, other state moneys or moneys from the stadium facility capital replacement account, including having title to such real and personal property in the name of the state or a public instrumentality thereof.\n\n(b) The provisions of sections 4-212 to 4-219 , inclusive, regarding the award of personal service agreements through competitive negotiation shall be applicable to all contracts and agreements for professional, technical, consulting, financial or management services entered into by the secretary in connection with the overall project and stadium facility operations, including contracts with the design professional and the stadium facility manager and any other contracts and agreements entered into by the secretary with respect to the planning, design, feasibility or permitting of any aspect of the overall project, the management of site acquisition or site preparation, or the management of, or provision of services in connection with, stadium facility operations. For purposes of this section, all such contracts and agreements shall be deemed to be personal service agreements for purposes of sections 4-212 to 4-219 , inclusive, without regard to whether or not such contracts and agreements relate to contractual services, as defined in section 4a-50 .\n\n(c) Notwithstanding any provision of the general statutes applicable to a state facility or public works project to the contrary, the secretary may select any prime construction contractor on a negotiated basis, provided that the secretary shall invite not less than three qualified general contractors or construction managers with current construction experience with major projects of comparable scope to submit proposals to act as a prime construction contractor, which invitation may include minimum requirements established by the secretary pursuant to subdivision (5) of section 32-655 .\n\n(d) Notwithstanding any provision of the general statutes applicable to a state facility or public works project to the contrary, except as otherwise provided in subsection (c) of this section, all construction contracts entered into by the secretary with respect to the overall project shall be entered into on an open-bid or negotiated basis, except that in the discretion of the secretary, where the estimated expense of any such construction contract is more than one hundred thousand dollars, the secretary may determine that selection of a contractor for a particular construction contract through the prequalification and public letting process provided for in subsection (e) of this section is warranted, is expected to be cost effective and is in the public interest of the state.\n\n(e) (1) With respect to any construction contract that is to be publicly let pursuant to subsection (d) of this section, the secretary shall identify a list of potentially responsible qualified bidders for the particular contract, to which list the secretary may add additional names. Thereafter, the secretary shall give notice to those on the list of the work required and of the invitation to prequalify. The invitation to prequalify shall contain such information as the secretary shall deem appropriate and a statement of the time and place where the responses shall be received. Upon receipt of such responses, the secretary shall select each bidder which has shown itself able to post surety bonds required by such contract and has demonstrated that it possesses the financial, managerial and technical ability and the integrity necessary and without conflict of interest for faithful and efficient performance of the work provided for therein. The secretary shall evaluate whether a bidder is responsible and qualified based on its experience with projects similar to that for which the bid is to be submitted, and based on objective written criteria which shall be approved by the secretary and included in the request for prequalification with respect to such contract. In lieu of such prequalification process, the secretary may deem to be prequalified those bidders listed on any list of qualified bidders maintained by the Department of Administrative Services or the Department of Transportation if the secretary determines that such list is appropriate in light of the scope and type of contract to be let.\n\n(2) The secretary shall thereafter give notice to those so prequalified of the time and place where the public letting shall occur and shall include in such notice such information of the work required as appropriate. At the time and place as set forth in the notice, the secretary shall publicly open and read the bids. The secretary shall not award any construction contract after public letting except to the responsible qualified bidder submitting the lowest bid and in compliance with the bid requirements. The secretary may, however, waive any informality in a bid, and may either reject all bids and again advertise for bids, or, enter into such construction contract on a negotiated basis.\n\n(3) The invitation to bid and the construction contract awarded shall contain such other terms and conditions, and such provisions for penalties, as the secretary may deem appropriate.\n\n(f) Any other agency or department of the state undertaking work related to the overall project, including work pursuant to subdivision (8) or (12) of section 32-655 , may select and engage professionals, consultants and contractors in the same manner as provided in this section in the case of the secretary, notwithstanding any provision of the general statutes.\n\n(g) The naming rights with respect to the stadium facility shall be subject to the control of the secretary, provided the secretary is authorized to enter into an agreement with the party furnishing the stadium facility site which agreement provides (1) that for a period not in excess of fifteen years from the date of the first event at the stadium facility the secretary shall agree not to offer such naming rights for commercial or other purposes and that the stadium facility shall be known as “Rentschler Field” to commemorate the seventy-five-year history of Pratt and Whitney Aircraft Company and its founder, Frederick B. Rentschler, (2) for a donation by such party to the secretary of two million dollars for use by the secretary for any traffic and road improvement in the vicinity of the stadium facility deemed necessary or desirable by the secretary to facilitate stadium facility operations, (3) if, at the expiration of the period of fifteen years referred to in subdivision (1) of this subsection, the secretary offers the naming rights with respect to the stadium facility for commercial or other purposes (A) such party shall have a right of first refusal with respect to the purchase of such naming rights, (B) the naming rights shall be offered on the condition that the name of the stadium shall include the phrase “at Rentschler Field” following the name selected, and (C) such party shall have a right to approve any name selected, such approval not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed.\n\n(h) Subject to the limitations of any agreement with the party furnishing the stadium facility site entered into pursuant to subsection (g) of this section, at such time as the secretary is permitted by such agreement to offer the naming rights with respect to the stadium facility for commercial or other purposes, the secretary is authorized to offer and sell such naming rights on the basis of a request for proposals and a process of competitive negotiation, subject to the advice of bond counsel to the state with respect to any private activity or similar restrictions that would result in an event of taxability with respect to any bonds issued or to be issued on a tax-exempt basis.\n\n(i) The secretary and the authority shall jointly select and appoint an independent construction contract compliance officer or agent, which may be an officer or agency of a political subdivision of the state, other than the authority, or a private consultant experienced in similar public contract compliance matters, to monitor compliance by the secretary, the authority, the project manager and each prime construction contractor with the provisions of applicable state law, including subdivision (1) of section 12-412 , subsection (a) of section 12-498 , sections 12-541 and 13a-25 , subdivision (1) of section 22a-134 , section 32-600 , subsection (d) of section 32-602 , subsection (c) of section 32-605 , section 32-610 , subsections (a) and (b) of section 32-614 , sections 32-617 , 32-617a , 32-650 , 32-651 to 32-658 , inclusive, 32-660 and 32-661 , subsection (b) of section 32-662 , section 32-663 , subsections (j) to (l), inclusive, of section 32-664 , sections 32-665 to 32-666a , inclusive, sections 32-668 and 48-21 and sections 29 and 30 of public act 00-140*, and with applicable requirements of contracts with the secretary or the authority, relating to set-asides for small contractors and minority business enterprises and required efforts to hire available and qualified members of minorities and available and qualified residents of the city of Hartford and the town of East Hartford for construction jobs with respect to the overall project and the on-site related private development. Such independent contract compliance officer or agent shall file a written report of his or her findings and recommendations with the secretary and the authority each quarter during the period of project development."

              "(a) The secretary may take all or a portion of the real property comprising the Adriaen's Landing site, and such off-site real property as may be determined by the secretary to be necessary to implement related infrastructure improvements. The owner or owners of such real property shall be paid by the state for all damages, and the state shall receive from such owner the amount or value of all benefits, resulting from such taking or development of the Adriaen's Landing site, including related site preparation and infrastructure improvements. The assessment of such damages and of such benefits shall be made by the secretary and filed by the secretary with the clerk of the superior court for the judicial district in which the real property is located. The assessment shall include the name and address of each person having an interest of record in the property. The clerk shall give notice of such assessment to each person having an interest of record in the property by mailing to each a copy of the same, postage prepaid. No entry fee shall be charged for the filing of such assessments. At any time after such assessment has been made by the secretary, the physical construction of the convention center, the related parking facilities, the on-site related private development and related site preparation and infrastructure improvements may be started.",
              "(b) If notice cannot be given to any person entitled to such notice because such person's whereabouts or existence is unknown, notice may be given by publishing a notice at least twice in a newspaper published in said judicial district and having a daily or weekly circulation in the town and city of Hartford. Any such published notice shall state that it is a notice to the last owner of record or such person's surviving spouse, heirs, administrators, assigns, representatives or creditors, if such person is deceased, and shall contain a brief description of the property taken. Notice shall also be given by mailing to each such person at such person's last-known address, by registered or certified mail, a copy of such notice. If, after a search of the land and probate records, the address of any interested party cannot be found, an affidavit stating such facts and reciting the steps taken to establish the address of any such person shall be filed with the clerk of the superior court and accepted in lieu of service of such notice by mailing the same to the last-known address of such person.",
              "(c) Upon filing an assessment with the clerk of the superior court, the secretary shall forthwith sign and file for record with the town clerk of the town and city of Hartford, a certificate setting forth the fact of such taking, a description of the real property so taken and the names and residences of the owners from whom it was taken. Upon the filing of such certificate, title to such real property in fee simple shall vest in the state, except that, if it is so specified in such certificate, a lesser estate, interest or right shall vest in the state. The secretary shall permit the last owner of record of such real property upon which a residence is situated to remain in such residence, rent free, for a period of one hundred twenty days after the filing of such certificate.",
              "(d) The assessment of such damages or such benefits may, and any reassessment thereof by the trial referee shall, take into account any evidence of environmental condition and required environmental remediation.",
              "(e) The secretary may take or purchase real property abutting or near the Adriaen's Landing site or any related infrastructure improvements for the purpose of protecting the functional characteristics of the convention center, the related parking facilities or the on-site related private development or such infrastructure improvements or to protect public safety or to implement such infrastructure improvements and may take or purchase any public service facility on or off the Adriaen's Landing site to the extent determined by the secretary to be necessary in the public interest to insure that no interruption in service results from any removal or relocation from the Adriaen's Landing site of any generation plant or other integral component of any such public service facility, in each case without regard to any other existing public use of such property. Such taking or purchase shall be in the same manner and with like powers as authorized and exercised by the secretary in taking or purchasing real property for the Adriaen's Landing site. In the event of any such taking or purchase of a public service facility, the secretary may sell such public service facility to, or make such other arrangements for the use and operation of such public service facility by, any qualified private or public entity, including the MIRA Dissolution Authority, on such terms as the secretary determines to be in the public interest.",
              "(f) As used in sections 32-650 to 32-668 , inclusive, “public service facility” means all privately, publicly or cooperatively owned lines, facilities and systems, and related real property interests, for producing, transmitting or distributing communications, cable television, power, electricity, light, heat, gas, oil, crude products, water, including heated or chilled water, steam, waste, storm water not connected with highway drainage and any other similar commodities, including fire and police signal systems and street lighting systems which directly or indirectly serve the public. Whenever the secretary determines that the construction or reconstruction of the convention center, the related parking facilities or the on-site related private development or related site preparation and infrastructure improvements necessitates the readjustment or relocation of any public service facility located within, on, along, over or under any land comprising the right-of-way of a state highway or any other public highway within, or removal of any such public service facility from, such right-of-way, the secretary shall issue an appropriate order to the company, corporation or municipality owning or operating such facility, and such company, corporation or municipality shall readjust, relocate or remove the same promptly in accordance with such order; provided an equitable share of the cost of such readjustment, relocation or removal, including the cost of installing and constructing a facility of equal capacity in a new location, shall be borne by the state. Such equitable share, in the case of or in connection with the construction or reconstruction of the convention center; or the related parking facilities shall be the entire cost, less the deductions as provided in this subsection. In establishing the equitable share of the cost to be borne by the state, there shall be deducted from the cost of the readjusted, relocated or removed public service facilities a sum based on a consideration of the value of materials salvaged from existing installations, the cost of the original installation, the life expectancy of the original public service facility and the unexpired term of such life use. When any public service facility is removed from the right-of-way of a public highway to a private right-of-way, the state shall not pay for such private right-of-way, provided, when a municipally-owned public service facility is thus removed from a municipally-owned highway, the state shall pay for the private right-of-way needed by the municipality for such relocation. If the secretary and the company, corporation or municipality owning or operating such public service facility cannot agree upon the share of the cost to be borne by the state, either may apply to the superior court for the judicial district within which such facility is situated for a determination of the cost to be borne by the state, and said court or such judge, after causing notice of the pendency of such application to be given to the other party, shall appoint a trial referee to make such determination. Such trial referee, having given at least ten days' notice to the parties interested of the time and place of the hearing, shall hear both parties, shall view such facility, shall take such testimony as such trial referee deems material and shall thereupon determine the amount of the cost to be borne by the state. Such determination shall, subject to right of appeal as in civil actions, be conclusive upon both parties.",
              "(g) Notwithstanding any provision of the general statutes, when the secretary finds it necessary that real property, the title to which is in the state or any municipality, political subdivision, public authority, district, quasi-public agency or other governmental entity and which is under the custody and control of any state department, commission or institution, municipality, political subdivision, public authority, district, quasi-public agency or other governmental entity, be taken for the purpose of constructing the convention center, the related parking facilities, the on-site related private development or related site preparation and infrastructure improvements, the secretary shall present a petition to such an entity having custody and control of such real property that custody of the real property be transferred to the secretary or the authority and such entity shall transfer the custody and control of such real property to the secretary or the authority for the purposes required.",
              "(h) The secretary or an agent may enter upon private real property for the purpose of conducting surveys, inspections, appraisals, or environmental and geological investigations for the location or construction of the convention center, the related parking facilities, the on-site related private development or related site preparation and infrastructure improvements. After giving reasonable notice to the real property owner or owners affected, the secretary or an agent may also enter such property for the purpose of performing borings, soundings or other tests required to accomplish any of the foregoing objectives with respect to the convention center, the related parking facilities, the on-site related private development or related site preparation or infrastructure improvements. The secretary or an agent shall use care so that no unnecessary damage shall result and the state shall pay damages to the owner of any real property for any damage or injury the secretary causes such owner by such entrance and use.

If the real property owner accepts such assessment of damages, such owner shall notify the secretary in writing, and said secretary shall pay such sum to said real property owner within thirty days or, after the expiration of said thirty days, shall pay such sum with interest at six per cent. If the real property owner is aggrieved by such assessment such owner shall notify the secretary in writing and may appeal to any court within its jurisdiction for a reassessment of such damages within six months from the date said secretary forwarded such assessment to such owner. This section shall not limit or modify rights of entry upon property otherwise provided for by the general statutes."

            "text": "(a) The secretary may take all or a portion of the real property comprising the Adriaen's Landing site, and such off-site real property as may be determined by the secretary to be necessary to implement related infrastructure improvements. The owner or owners of such real property shall be paid by the state for all damages, and the state shall receive from such owner the amount or value of all benefits, resulting from such taking or development of the Adriaen's Landing site, including related site preparation and infrastructure improvements. The assessment of such damages and of such benefits shall be made by the secretary and filed by the secretary with the clerk of the superior court for the judicial district in which the real property is located. The assessment shall include the name and address of each person having an interest of record in the property. The clerk shall give notice of such assessment to each person having an interest of record in the property by mailing to each a copy of the same, postage prepaid. No entry fee shall be charged for the filing of such assessments. At any time after such assessment has been made by the secretary, the physical construction of the convention center, the related parking facilities, the on-site related private development and related site preparation and infrastructure improvements may be started.\n\n(b) If notice cannot be given to any person entitled to such notice because such person's whereabouts or existence is unknown, notice may be given by publishing a notice at least twice in a newspaper published in said judicial district and having a daily or weekly circulation in the town and city of Hartford. Any such published notice shall state that it is a notice to the last owner of record or such person's surviving spouse, heirs, administrators, assigns, representatives or creditors, if such person is deceased, and shall contain a brief description of the property taken. Notice shall also be given by mailing to each such person at such person's last-known address, by registered or certified mail, a copy of such notice. If, after a search of the land and probate records, the address of any interested party cannot be found, an affidavit stating such facts and reciting the steps taken to establish the address of any such person shall be filed with the clerk of the superior court and accepted in lieu of service of such notice by mailing the same to the last-known address of such person.\n\n(c) Upon filing an assessment with the clerk of the superior court, the secretary shall forthwith sign and file for record with the town clerk of the town and city of Hartford, a certificate setting forth the fact of such taking, a description of the real property so taken and the names and residences of the owners from whom it was taken. Upon the filing of such certificate, title to such real property in fee simple shall vest in the state, except that, if it is so specified in such certificate, a lesser estate, interest or right shall vest in the state. The secretary shall permit the last owner of record of such real property upon which a residence is situated to remain in such residence, rent free, for a period of one hundred twenty days after the filing of such certificate.\n\n(d) The assessment of such damages or such benefits may, and any reassessment thereof by the trial referee shall, take into account any evidence of environmental condition and required environmental remediation.\n\n(e) The secretary may take or purchase real property abutting or near the Adriaen's Landing site or any related infrastructure improvements for the purpose of protecting the functional characteristics of the convention center, the related parking facilities or the on-site related private development or such infrastructure improvements or to protect public safety or to implement such infrastructure improvements and may take or purchase any public service facility on or off the Adriaen's Landing site to the extent determined by the secretary to be necessary in the public interest to insure that no interruption in service results from any removal or relocation from the Adriaen's Landing site of any generation plant or other integral component of any such public service facility, in each case without regard to any other existing public use of such property. Such taking or purchase shall be in the same manner and with like powers as authorized and exercised by the secretary in taking or purchasing real property for the Adriaen's Landing site. In the event of any such taking or purchase of a public service facility, the secretary may sell such public service facility to, or make such other arrangements for the use and operation of such public service facility by, any qualified private or public entity, including the MIRA Dissolution Authority, on such terms as the secretary determines to be in the public interest.\n\n(f) As used in sections 32-650 to 32-668 , inclusive, “public service facility” means all privately, publicly or cooperatively owned lines, facilities and systems, and related real property interests, for producing, transmitting or distributing communications, cable television, power, electricity, light, heat, gas, oil, crude products, water, including heated or chilled water, steam, waste, storm water not connected with highway drainage and any other similar commodities, including fire and police signal systems and street lighting systems which directly or indirectly serve the public. Whenever the secretary determines that the construction or reconstruction of the convention center, the related parking facilities or the on-site related private development or related site preparation and infrastructure improvements necessitates the readjustment or relocation of any public service facility located within, on, along, over or under any land comprising the right-of-way of a state highway or any other public highway within, or removal of any such public service facility from, such right-of-way, the secretary shall issue an appropriate order to the company, corporation or municipality owning or operating such facility, and such company, corporation or municipality shall readjust, relocate or remove the same promptly in accordance with such order; provided an equitable share of the cost of such readjustment, relocation or removal, including the cost of installing and constructing a facility of equal capacity in a new location, shall be borne by the state. Such equitable share, in the case of or in connection with the construction or reconstruction of the convention center; or the related parking facilities shall be the entire cost, less the deductions as provided in this subsection. In establishing the equitable share of the cost to be borne by the state, there shall be deducted from the cost of the readjusted, relocated or removed public service facilities a sum based on a consideration of the value of materials salvaged from existing installations, the cost of the original installation, the life expectancy of the original public service facility and the unexpired term of such life use. When any public service facility is removed from the right-of-way of a public highway to a private right-of-way, the state shall not pay for such private right-of-way, provided, when a municipally-owned public service facility is thus removed from a municipally-owned highway, the state shall pay for the private right-of-way needed by the municipality for such relocation. If the secretary and the company, corporation or municipality owning or operating such public service facility cannot agree upon the share of the cost to be borne by the state, either may apply to the superior court for the judicial district within which such facility is situated for a determination of the cost to be borne by the state, and said court or such judge, after causing notice of the pendency of such application to be given to the other party, shall appoint a trial referee to make such determination. Such trial referee, having given at least ten days' notice to the parties interested of the time and place of the hearing, shall hear both parties, shall view such facility, shall take such testimony as such trial referee deems material and shall thereupon determine the amount of the cost to be borne by the state. Such determination shall, subject to right of appeal as in civil actions, be conclusive upon both parties.\n\n(g) Notwithstanding any provision of the general statutes, when the secretary finds it necessary that real property, the title to which is in the state or any municipality, political subdivision, public authority, district, quasi-public agency or other governmental entity and which is under the custody and control of any state department, commission or institution, municipality, political subdivision, public authority, district, quasi-public agency or other governmental entity, be taken for the purpose of constructing the convention center, the related parking facilities, the on-site related private development or related site preparation and infrastructure improvements, the secretary shall present a petition to such an entity having custody and control of such real property that custody of the real property be transferred to the secretary or the authority and such entity shall transfer the custody and control of such real property to the secretary or the authority for the purposes required.\n\n(h) The secretary or an agent may enter upon private real property for the purpose of conducting surveys, inspections, appraisals, or environmental and geological investigations for the location or construction of the convention center, the related parking facilities, the on-site related private development or related site preparation and infrastructure improvements. After giving reasonable notice to the real property owner or owners affected, the secretary or an agent may also enter such property for the purpose of performing borings, soundings or other tests required to accomplish any of the foregoing objectives with respect to the convention center, the related parking facilities, the on-site related private development or related site preparation or infrastructure improvements. The secretary or an agent shall use care so that no unnecessary damage shall result and the state shall pay damages to the owner of any real property for any damage or injury the secretary causes such owner by such entrance and use. If entry to any real property for the purpose of performing borings, soundings or other tests is refused to the secretary or an agent after the secretary has given reasonable notice to the owner or owners thereof, the secretary shall assess damages in the manner provided by this section and, at any time after such assessment has been made by said secretary, may enter said property for the purpose of performing borings, soundings or other tests. If the real property owner accepts such assessment of damages, such owner shall notify the secretary in writing, and said secretary shall pay such sum to said real property owner within thirty days or, after the expiration of said thirty days, shall pay such sum with interest at six per cent. If the real property owner is aggrieved by such assessment such owner shall notify the secretary in writing and may appeal to any court within its jurisdiction for a reassessment of such damages within six months from the date said secretary forwarded such assessment to such owner. This section shall not limit or modify rights of entry upon property otherwise provided for by the general statutes."

Each license or permit shall be issued, approval shall be granted and administrative action shall be taken not later than ten business days after the date of submission of any application for such license, permit, approval or administrative action to the commissioner. Each application for a license or permit shall be deemed to have been issued, approval shall be deemed to have been granted and administrative action shall be deemed to have been taken as requested unless such application has been denied or conditionally issued prior to the close of business on the tenth business day after either the date of submission of such application, or a hearing is held on such application pursuant to this section. Any requirement for permits or inspections by the State Building Inspector or State Fire Marshal shall be satisfied if the secretary obtains a certification from an engineer or other appropriate professional duly certified or licensed in the state, to the effect that such work, to the extent such work is subject to approval by the State Building Inspector or State Fire Marshal, is in compliance with state building or fire laws and regulations, as applicable.",

The appellant shall serve a copy of the appeal on each party listed in the final decision at the address shown in such decision. Failure to make such service within the ten days on parties other than the commissioner who rendered the final decision may not, in the discretion of the court, deprive the court of jurisdiction over the appeal. Not later than ten days following the service of such appeal, or within such further time as may be allowed by the court, the commissioner who rendered such decision shall cause any portion of the record that had not been transcribed to be transcribed and shall cause either the original or a certified copy of the entire record of the proceeding appealed from to be transmitted to the reviewing court.

The commissioner who rendered the decision shall appear as the respondent. Appeals to the Superior Court shall each be privileged matters and shall be heard as soon after the return date as practicable. A court shall render its decision not later than twenty-one days after the date that the entire record with the transcript is filed with the court by the commissioner who rendered the decision.",
              "(h) The court shall not substitute its judgment for that of the commissioner as to the weight of the evidence presented on a question of fact. The court shall affirm the decision of the commissioner unless the court finds that substantial rights of the party appealing the decision have been materially prejudiced because the administrative findings, inferences, conclusions or decisions of the commissioner are: (1) In violation of constitutional or statutory provisions; (2) in excess of the statutory authority of the commissioner; (3) made upon unlawful procedure; (4) affected by an error of law; (5) clearly erroneous in view of the reliable, probative and substantial evidence on the whole record; or (6) arbitrary, capricious or characterized by abuse of discretion or clearly unwarranted exercise of discretion.",

The commissioner may issue a permit consistent with such judgment. An applicant may file an amended application and the commissioner may consider an amended application for an order, permit or other administrative action following court action.",

The authority is authorized to assist the city of Hartford in the preparation and processing of any environmental impact statement with respect to such sequence of planned activities or any part thereof required to be undertaken by the city of Hartford on behalf of any federal agency under the National Environmental Policy Act, and the Office of Policy and Management is authorized to assist the town of East Hartford in the preparation and processing of any environmental impact statement with respect to such sequence of planned activities or any part thereof required to be undertaken by the town of East Hartford on behalf of any federal agency under the National Environmental Policy Act. Such assistance may include the expansion of the scope of the environmental evaluation undertaken by the authority or the Office of Policy and Management to the extent necessary to satisfy the requirements of the National Environmental Policy Act and assistance with such additional procedural requirements as may pertain thereto. The authority, the city of Hartford, the Office of Policy and Management and the town of East Hartford may enter into memoranda of understanding with respect to such assistance, which may include provisions for an appropriate allocation of any additional costs incurred by the authority or the Office of Policy and Management, respectively, in connection therewith. To the extent that any activity, facility or project of any other public or private entity is included in any environmental evaluation undertaken by the authority, or the Office of Policy and Management, the authority or the Office of Policy and Management, as the case may be, shall be entitled to receive payment or reimbursement of such entity's allocable share of the costs incurred by the authority or the Office of Policy and Management, respectively, in connection therewith.

The authority and the Office of Policy and Management, as the case may be, shall submit their evaluations and a summary thereof, including any negative findings to the Commissioner of Energy and Environmental Protection and the secretary and shall make the evaluations and summaries available to the public for inspection and comment at the same time. Notwithstanding the regulations adopted pursuant to section 22a-1a , the authority and the Office of Policy and Management each shall hold a public hearing on its evaluation and shall publish notice of the availability of its evaluation and summary in a newspaper of general circulation in the city of Hartford and, with respect to the stadium facility project, the town of East Hartford not less than fourteen calendar days before the date of such hearing. Any person may comment at the public hearing or in writing not later than the second day following the close of the public hearing. All public comments received by the authority and the Office of Policy and Management, as the case may be, shall be promptly forwarded to the Commissioner of Energy and Environmental Protection and the secretary and shall be made available for public inspection. Nothing in subsection (b) of section 22a-1 shall be deemed to require that any such written evaluation of environmental impact be completed prior to the award of contracts, the incurrence of obligations or the expenditure of funds in connection with the acquisition of the Adriaen's Landing site or the stadium facility site, planning and engineering studies for site preparation or preliminary site preparation work not requiring permits or approvals not yet obtained, or the planning and design of the stadium facility and the related parking facilities or the convention center. Nothing in this section shall be deemed to require that applications for licenses, permits, approvals or other administrative action in connection with all aspects of the overall project be submitted or acted upon at the same time if not otherwise required by law.",
              "(k) The secretary shall review the evaluations, together with the comments thereon, and shall make a written determination as to whether such evaluations satisfy the requirements of sections 22a-1a to 22a-1c , inclusive, which determination shall be made public and forwarded to the authority no later than ten days after the close of the hearing. The secretary may require the revision of either evaluation if the secretary finds that the evaluation is inadequate. In making a determination, the secretary shall take into account all public and agency comments.",
              "(l) In exercising jurisdiction over any license, permit or approval required in connection with the overall project, the Commissioner of Energy and Environmental Protection shall take into consideration all public comments received in connection with the evaluations submitted by the authority or the Office of Policy and Management, as the case may be, pursuant to subsection (j) of this section if and to the extent available at such time and shall make written findings with respect to any such comments which are relevant to the issuance or denial of any such license or permit or the grant or denial of any such approval. For applications to the Commissioner of Energy and Environmental Protection requiring a public hearing and to the extent practicable in light of the development schedule for the overall project, there shall be a single submission date. The Commissioner of Energy and Environmental Protection shall adopt a master administrative process for any licenses, permits or approvals or administrative actions which would otherwise have required a public hearing pursuant to statute or regulation, which, to the extent practicable in light of the development schedule for the overall project, shall include a single public hearing for the convention center project and the parking project, and a single public hearing for the stadium facility project. Any such public hearing shall be limited to considering issues or factors not included in the related environmental evaluation. The provisions of subsection (d) of this section regarding deadlines for administrative action shall not apply to any license or permit issued or any approval granted by the Commissioner of Energy and Environmental Protection. The Commissioner of Energy and Environmental Protection shall issue a notice of sufficiency concerning the completeness of any application within fourteen days of receipt. The master process shall provide for department review, public comment and the holding of a public hearing within thirty days of the notice of sufficiency. The commissioner shall have thirty days from the close of a public hearing to issue a decision. For licenses, permits, approvals and administrative actions not requiring a public hearing, the Commissioner of Energy and Environmental Protection may issue a decision or take administrative action at any time as may otherwise be permitted by applicable laws and regulations, but in no event later than thirty days following the completion of any public hearing relating to the same aspect of the overall project."
