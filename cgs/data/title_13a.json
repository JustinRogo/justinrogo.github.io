The use of any site acquired for highway maintenance storage area or garage purposes by condemnation shall conform to any zoning ordinance or development plan in effect for the area in which such site is located, provided the commissioner may be granted any variance or special exception as may be made pursuant to the zoning ordinances and regulations of the town in which any such site is to be acquired. The assessment of such damages and of such benefits shall be made by the commissioner and filed by the commissioner with the clerk of the superior court for the judicial district in which the land affected is located. The commissioner shall give notice of such assessment to each person having an interest of record therein, or such person's designated agent for service of process, by mailing to such person a copy of the same, postage prepaid, and, at any time after such assessment has been made by the commissioner, the physical construction of such layout, alteration, extension, widening, maintenance storage area or garage, change of grade or other improvement may be made. If notice cannot be given to any person entitled thereto because such person's whereabouts or existence is unknown, notice may be given by publishing a notice at least twice in a newspaper published in the judicial district and having a daily or weekly circulation in the town in which the property affected is located. Any such published notice shall state that it is a notice to the last owner of record or such owner's surviving spouse, heirs, administrators, assigns, representatives or creditors if he or she is deceased, and shall contain a brief description of the property taken. Notice shall also be given by mailing to such person at his or her last-known address, by registered or certified mail, a copy of such notice. If, after a search of the land and probate records, the address of any interested party cannot be found, an affidavit stating such facts and reciting the steps taken to establish the address of any such person shall be filed with the clerk of the court and accepted in lieu of service of such notice by mailing the same to the last-known address of such person. Upon filing an assessment with the clerk of the court, the commissioner shall forthwith sign and file for record with the town clerk of the town in which such real property is located a certificate setting forth the fact of such taking, a description of the real property so taken and the names and residences of the owners from whom it was taken. Upon the filing of such certificate, title to such real property in fee simple shall vest in the state of Connecticut, except that, if it is so specified in such certificate, a lesser estate, interest or right shall vest in the state. The commissioner shall permit the last owner of record of such real property upon which an owner-occupied residence or owner-operated business is situated to remain in such residence or operate such business, rent free, for a period of ninety days after the filing of such certificate.",

The commissioner, with the advice and consent of the Attorney General, may settle and compromise any claim by any person, firm or corporation claiming to be aggrieved by such layout, construction, reconstruction, repair or maintenance by the payment of money, the transfer of other land acquired for or in connection with highway purposes, or otherwise.

The commissioner may assess benefits and damages caused by any such construction and for the taking of any such land under the provisions of subsection (b) of this section and sections 13a-74 , 13a-76 , 13a-77 and 13a-78 and any person aggrieved by the assessment of any such benefits or damages shall be entitled to the relief provided for in said sections.",

Such petition shall set forth the necessity for such transfer and control. The Secretary of the Office of Policy and Management shall present such petition to the department, commission or institution having custody and control of such real property, and, upon the recommendation of, and subject to such consideration as may be required by, such department, commission or institution and with the approval of the Secretary of the Office of Policy and Management, such department, commission or institution shall transfer the custody and control of such real property to the Commissioner of Transportation for the purposes required.",

The use of any site acquired for highway maintenance storage area or garage purposes by condemnation shall conform to any zoning ordinance or development plan in effect for the area in which such site is located, provided the commissioner may be granted any variance or special exception as may be made pursuant to the zoning ordinances and regulations of the town in which any such site is to be acquired. The assessment of such damages and of such benefits shall be made by the commissioner and filed by the commissioner with the clerk of the superior court for the judicial district in which the land affected is located. The commissioner shall give notice of such assessment to each person having an interest of record therein, or such person's designated agent for service of process, by mailing to such person a copy of the same, postage prepaid, and, at any time after such assessment has been made by the commissioner, the physical construction of such layout, alteration, extension, widening, maintenance storage area or garage, change of grade or other improvement may be made. If notice cannot be given to any person entitled thereto because such person's whereabouts or existence is unknown, notice may be given by publishing a notice at least twice in a newspaper published in the judicial district and having a daily or weekly circulation in the town in which the property affected is located. Any such published notice shall state that it is a notice to the last owner of record or such owner's surviving spouse, heirs, administrators, assigns, representatives or creditors if he or she is deceased, and shall contain a brief description of the property taken. Notice shall also be given by mailing to such person at his or her last-known address, by registered or certified mail, a copy of such notice. If, after a search of the land and probate records, the address of any interested party cannot be found, an affidavit stating such facts and reciting the steps taken to establish the address of any such person shall be filed with the clerk of the court and accepted in lieu of service of such notice by mailing the same to the last-known address of such person. Upon filing an assessment with the clerk of the court, the commissioner shall forthwith sign and file for record with the town clerk of the town in which such real property is located a certificate setting forth the fact of such taking, a description of the real property so taken and the names and residences of the owners from whom it was taken. Upon the filing of such certificate, title to such real property in fee simple shall vest in the state of Connecticut, except that, if it is so specified in such certificate, a lesser estate, interest or right shall vest in the state. The commissioner shall permit the last owner of record of such real property upon which an owner-occupied residence or owner-operated business is situated to remain in such residence or operate such business, rent free, for a period of ninety days after the filing of such certificate.\n\n(c) The commissioner may purchase any land and take a deed thereof in the name of the state when such land is needed in connection with the layout, construction, repair, reconstruction or maintenance of any state highway or bridge, and any land or buildings or both, necessary, in the commissioner's opinion, for the efficient accomplishment of the foregoing purpose, and may further, when the commissioner determines that it is in the best interests of the state, purchase, lease or otherwise arrange for the acquisition or exchange of land or buildings or both for such purpose. The commissioner, with the advice and consent of the Attorney General, may settle and compromise any claim by any person, firm or corporation claiming to be aggrieved by such layout, construction, reconstruction, repair or maintenance by the payment of money, the transfer of other land acquired for or in connection with highway purposes, or otherwise. The commissioner shall permit the last owner of record of such real property upon which an owner-occupied residence or owner-operated business is situated to remain in such residence or operate such business, rent free, for a period of ninety days from the filing of such deed.\n\n(d) The commissioner may purchase or take in the name of the state any land, buildings, interest in land, easements or other rights he finds necessary for the layout, construction, maintenance or use of roads or bridges authorized by section 13a-5 , under the provisions of this title relating to the purchase and taking of land for state highways. Any person aggrieved by any such action of the commissioner shall have the same rights of appeal as provided in this title in relation to the taking of land by the commissioner for highway purposes.\n\n(e) The commissioner may take any land (1) which is necessary for the construction of any ditch, drain, gutter or other structure which is required for the purpose of draining any state highway; or (2) which is required for the purpose of preserving any historical monument or memorial, the removal of which is made necessary by the construction or reconstruction of a state highway. The commissioner may assess benefits and damages caused by any such construction and for the taking of any such land under the provisions of subsection (b) of this section and sections 13a-74 , 13a-76 , 13a-77 and 13a-78 and any person aggrieved by the assessment of any such benefits or damages shall be entitled to the relief provided for in said sections.\n\n(f) The commissioner may take or purchase rights of access to and egress from land abutting any highway or land taken or purchased as right-of-way therefor, or any other highway for the purpose of protecting the functional characteristics of any state highway or state highway appurtenances or safety of the traveling public to and from any state highway or state highway appurtenances when in his judgment such limitation of access is necessary to permit the convenient, safe and expeditious flow of traffic. Such taking or purchase shall be in the same manner and with like powers as authorized and exercised by said commissioner in taking or purchasing real property for state highway purposes.\n\n(g) When the Commissioner of Transportation finds it necessary that real property, the title to which is in the state of Connecticut and which is under the custody and control of any state department, commission or institution, be taken for the purpose of drainage, construction, alteration, reconstruction, improvement, relocation, widening and change of grade of any highway to be constructed under his supervision, he shall petition the Secretary of the Office of Policy and Management that custody of such real property be transferred to him as Commissioner of Transportation. Such petition shall set forth the necessity for such transfer and control. The Secretary of the Office of Policy and Management shall present such petition to the department, commission or institution having custody and control of such real property, and, upon the recommendation of, and subject to such consideration as may be required by, such department, commission or institution and with the approval of the Secretary of the Office of Policy and Management, such department, commission or institution shall transfer the custody and control of such real property to the Commissioner of Transportation for the purposes required.\n\n(h) All sales or exchanges of surplus property by the Department of Transportation and matters dealing with the initial acquisition of any existing mass transit system or the purchase or sale of real properties acquired in connection with any state highway system or mass transit system shall be subject to review and approval of the State Properties Review Board except that those acquisitions and administrative settlements relating to such properties which involve sums not in excess of ten thousand dollars shall be reported to the board by the Commissioner of Transportation but shall not be subject to such review and approval. The Secretary of the Office of Policy and Management shall be informed for inventory purposes of any transfer effectuated in connection with this section. The State Properties Review Board shall not grant such approval if the Department of Transportation has failed to comply with any applicable statutes in connection with the proposed action.\n\nSee Sec. 13a-6 re reimbursement of state by federal government for costs incurred in constructing roads and bridges for military purposes.\n\nSee Sec. 13a-25 re appointment of additional referees for land acquisition proceedings.\n\nSee Sec. 13a-58 re public hearing on proposed layout of new highway.\n\nSee Secs. 13a-76 and 13a-77 re appeals from decisions of commissioner.\n\nSee Sec. 13a-80 re sale or lease of land by commissioner.\n\nSee Sec. 13a-80b re order of priorities in disposition of interests in state rights-of-way."

This section shall be effective only as to any land determined to be taken by the Highway Commissioner before July 1, 1963.\n\nSee Sec. 13a-25 re appointment of additional referees for land acquisition proceedings."

If such committee finds that the construction or maintenance of such a bridge without a draw will not materially interfere with the navigation of such water, such committee, after giving at least five days' notice in the manner prescribed for the service of legal process to all persons owning wharves, docks or wharf privileges above such bridge, may assess the damages which the construction of such bridge without a draw will cause to the owners of such wharf or wharf privileges and, if the committee finds that the total amount of such damages, if paid by the town in which such bridge is located, will be more economical for such town than the construction or maintenance of such bridge with a draw, such bridge may be maintained, built or constructed without a draw, after the amount of damages so found has been paid to the parties entitled to the same or has been deposited in the town treasury subject to their order; and the amount of such damages shall be paid by the town in which the bridge is located, as a part of the expense of building or maintaining such highway or bridge. All persons interested in such wharves or wharf privileges shall be entitled to all of the privileges by way of remonstrance and reestimate of damages which are provided in part III of this chapter for persons interested in laying out or altering a highway. This section shall not be construed to authorize the construction of a bridge without a draw over Branford River below Hobart's Bridge."

Whenever the commissioner determines that any public service facility located within, on, along, over or under any land comprising the right-of-way of a state highway or any other public highway when necessitated by the construction or reconstruction of a state highway shall be readjusted or relocated in or removed from such right-of-way, the commissioner shall issue an appropriate order to the company, corporation or municipality owning or operating such facility, and such company, corporation or municipality shall readjust, relocate or remove the same promptly in accordance with such order; provided an equitable share of the cost of such readjustment, relocation or removal, including the cost of installing and constructing a facility of equal capacity in a new location, shall be borne by the state, except that the state shall not bear any share of the cost of a project of an electric distribution company, as defined in section 16-1 , to readjust, relocate or remove any facility, as defined in subsection (a) of section 16-50i , used for transmitting electricity or as an electric transmission trunkline. The Department of Transportation shall evaluate the total costs of such a project, including department costs for construction or reconstruction and electric distribution company costs for readjusting, relocating or removing such facility, so as to minimize the overall costs incurred by the state and the electric distribution company. The electric distribution company may provide the department with proposed alternatives to the relocation, readjustment or removal proposed by the department and shall be responsible for any changes to project costs attributable to adoption of the company's proposed alternative designs for such project, including changes to the area of the relocation, readjustment or removal and any incremental costs incurred by the department to evaluate such alternatives. If such electric distribution company and the department cannot agree on a plan for such project, the Commissioner of Transportation and the chairperson of the Public Utilities Regulatory Authority shall, on request of the company, jointly determine the alternative for the project. Such equitable share, in the case of or in connection with the construction or reconstruction of any limited access highway, shall be the entire cost, less the deductions provided in this section, and, in the case of or in connection with the construction or reconstruction of any other state highway, shall be such portion or all of the entire cost, less the deductions provided in this section, as may be fair and just under all the circumstances, but shall not be less than fifty per cent of such cost after the deductions provided in this section. In establishing the equitable share of the cost to be borne by the state, there shall be deducted from the cost of the readjusted, relocated or removed facilities a sum based on a consideration of the value of materials salvaged from existing installations, the cost of the original installation, the life expectancy of the original facility and the unexpired term of such life use. When any facility is removed from the right-of-way of a public highway to a private right-of-way, the state shall not pay for such private right-of-way, provided, when a municipally owned facility is thus removed from a municipally owned highway, the state shall pay for the private right-of-way needed by the municipality for such relocation. If the commissioner and the company, corporation or municipality owning or operating such facility cannot agree upon the share of the cost to be borne by the state, either may apply to the superior court for the judicial district within which such highway is situated, or, if said court is not in session, to any judge thereof, for a determination of the cost to be borne by the state, and said court or such judge, after causing notice of the pendency of such application to be given to the other party, shall appoint a state referee to make such determination. Such referee, having given at least ten days' notice to the parties interested of the time and place of the hearing, shall hear both parties, shall view such highway, shall take such testimony as such referee deems material and shall thereupon determine the amount of the cost to be borne by the state and immediately report to the court.

No such permit shall be issued by the commissioner unless the chief elected official of the municipality in which any tree with a diameter greater than eighteen inches is situated is notified in writing. The notice shall include the location and a description of such tree to be cut or removed. No such permit for the removal of any such tree, shrub or vegetation shall be refused if such removal is necessary for that use of such adjoining land which is of the highest pecuniary value. If such permit is refused on any state highway right-of-way, where the state does not own the right-of-way in fee, the owner of such tree, shrub or vegetation may, within thirty days thereafter, request said commissioner in writing to purchase or condemn an easement for the purpose of maintaining such tree, shrub or vegetation and, if said commissioner does not purchase the same, he shall condemn it, in the manner provided for the condemnation of land for the construction, alteration, extension or widening of state highways. Any payment so made shall be from funds appropriated to the Department of Transportation. Said commissioner may plant, set out and care for trees, shrubs or vegetation within the limits of such highways and, by agreement with the owner of land adjoining such highways, upon such adjoining land. Upon request in writing within thirty days of planting of trees, shrubs or vegetation to delimit boundaries of a highway by an adjoining owner not agreeing thereto, said commissioner shall purchase or condemn an easement for the purpose of maintaining such tree, shrub or vegetation in the manner provided in this subsection. When the removal of such tree, shrub or vegetation is necessary for that use of such adjoining land which is of the highest pecuniary value, said commissioner shall remove the same upon payment to him of all sums paid for said planting and for any such easement with interest at the rate of six per cent per annum. Any person, firm or corporation cutting, removing, damaging or pruning any tree, shrub or vegetation in violation of the provisions of this subsection, whether it was planted by the commissioner or not, without a permit from said commissioner, shall be fined not more than one thousand dollars for each such violation and shall be liable civilly for any damage in an action brought by said commissioner.",

No person, firm or corporation, and no officer, agent or employee of any municipal or other corporation, shall cut, remove or prune any tree, shrub or vegetation situated partially or wholly within the limits of any such highway without first obtaining from said commissioner a written permit therefor, provided however, that nothing contained in this subsection shall limit the rights of public service companies, as defined in section 16-1 , to cut and trim trees and branches and otherwise protect their lines, wires, conduits, cables and other equipment from encroaching vegetation. No such permit shall be issued by the commissioner unless the chief elected official of the municipality in which any tree with a diameter greater than eighteen inches is situated is notified in writing. The notice shall include the location and a description of such tree to be cut or removed. No such permit for the removal of any such tree, shrub or vegetation shall be refused if such removal is necessary for that use of such adjoining land which is of the highest pecuniary value. If such permit is refused on any state highway right-of-way, where the state does not own the right-of-way in fee, the owner of such tree, shrub or vegetation may, within thirty days thereafter, request said commissioner in writing to purchase or condemn an easement for the purpose of maintaining such tree, shrub or vegetation and, if said commissioner does not purchase the same, he shall condemn it, in the manner provided for the condemnation of land for the construction, alteration, extension or widening of state highways. Any payment so made shall be from funds appropriated to the Department of Transportation. Said commissioner may plant, set out and care for trees, shrubs or vegetation within the limits of such highways and, by agreement with the owner of land adjoining such highways, upon such adjoining land. Upon request in writing within thirty days of planting of trees, shrubs or vegetation to delimit boundaries of a highway by an adjoining owner not agreeing thereto, said commissioner shall purchase or condemn an easement for the purpose of maintaining such tree, shrub or vegetation in the manner provided in this subsection. When the removal of such tree, shrub or vegetation is necessary for that use of such adjoining land which is of the highest pecuniary value, said commissioner shall remove the same upon payment to him of all sums paid for said planting and for any such easement with interest at the rate of six per cent per annum. Any person, firm or corporation cutting, removing, damaging or pruning any tree, shrub or vegetation in violation of the provisions of this subsection, whether it was planted by the commissioner or not, without a permit from said commissioner, shall be fined not more than one thousand dollars for each such violation and shall be liable civilly for any damage in an action brought by said commissioner.\n\n(b) Notwithstanding the provisions of section 51-164p , any municipality, by ordinance, may establish a civil penalty of not more than one thousand dollars, for cutting, removing, damaging or pruning any tree, shrub or vegetation in violation of the provisions of subsection (a) of this section, on any scenic road, designated pursuant to section 13b-31c , located in said municipality. Any such ordinance shall provide for notice and an opportunity for a hearing prior to the imposition of any such civil penalty. Any person who is assessed a civil penalty pursuant to this subsection may appeal therefrom to the Superior Court."

The commissioner and the state shall not be liable in damages for injury to person or property when such injury occurred on any highway or part thereof abandoned by the state or on any portion of a highway not a state highway but connecting with or crossing a state highway, which portion is not within the traveled portion of such state highway. The requirement of notice specified in this section shall be deemed complied with if an action is commenced, by a writ and complaint setting forth the injury and a general description of the same and of the cause thereof and of the time and place of its occurrence, within the time limited for the giving of such notice."

Court found that plaintiff's notice sufficiently identified the location of her fall so as to permit commissioner to gather information about the allegedly defective condition and that the issue of adequacy of plaintiff's notice was a question of fact for the jury. 70 CA 21. It is plaintiff's burden to prove each of the elements under statute, and failure to prove any element will preclude a finding of liability under statute. 72 CA 64. Phrase “place of its occurrence” refers to prior phrase “such injury”, and therefore it is the place of injury that must be described in required notice; the legal standard is not the exact geodetic place of injury; however, that standard is not satisfied when the place of injury is described as two distinct places. 78 CA 796; judgment reversed, see 273 C. 1. Plaintiff's notice of claim is insufficient because it fails to specify the precise nature of the claimed defect; it is not enough that defendant knows the exact location of the defect when the precise nature of the defect is unspecified and the complaint cannot be considered in conjunction with the notice because the complaint was filed beyond the 90-day period set forth in section. 132 CA 750. Court lacks jurisdiction to hear claim against state where notice informed commissioner only of suit against town. 142 CA 785. A claim related to an alleged defect in the plan pursuant to which a highway was constructed, rather than a claim that a defect in such plan or design resulted in an otherwise actionable hazard that was in or near the roadway and which actually obstructed travel, is precluded. Id., 826. Plaintiff failed to satisfy statutory requirement where the notice to defendant provided locations of defects that either did not exist or could not have been geographically accurate. 152 CA 560. An assessment of whether defendant's response to notice of highway defect was reasonable is a fact-specific determination and depends on many different factors, some of which may be unique to each case. 168 CA 570; judgment reversed in part, see 330 C. 400. Actual notice to the state police of a highway defect constitutes actual notice to defendant, which occurs when state police first learn of the defect, not the later time when they report that defect to defendant or the department. Id. Section unambiguously waives sovereign immunity for defective highway claims based upon the neglect or default of the commissioner, the state and any state employees, at least when performing duties related to highway maintenance, and it does not limit or restrict its scope to department employees only.

Notice that decedent fell “upon a sidewalk of a highway known as North Elm Street” is insufficient description. 117 C. 70. Notice failing entirely to state cause of injury is invalid; knowledge of facts by officers of city will not obviate necessity of compliance with statute. Id., 401. Fundamental test is whether defect was sole cause in producing damage; notice of defect may be imputed to city after passage of time. 118 C. 288; 128 C. 272. Defect must be sole and essential cause of injury; if negligence of plaintiff's intestate or of third party is also a proximate cause, no recovery. 118 C. 480; 124 C. 463. Where injury is result of defect combined with accident or natural cause, municipality is liable unless accident or natural cause was so direct and separate as to be sole proximate cause. 119 C. 168.

City not liable for nuisance where sidewalk on grade became dangerous only when icy and city could do nothing practicable by way of construction to make it more safe. 120 C. 499. Purpose and elements of notice; entire absence of general description of injury is fatal. Id., 577. Cited. 121 C. 613.

What constitutes a defect; small cavity at edge of walk not. Id., 283. Cited. Id., 677. Statute affords exclusive remedy for defects due to neglect rather than positive act of municipality, whether or not defect is a nuisance; apart from statute, municipality is liable for condition it created by positive act on highway amounting to nuisance. 126 C. 402; 131 C. 691; 133 C. 245. 60-day notice held not a condition precedent where action was based on negligence of railroad company at common law in permitting dangerous condition on bridge. 126 C. 558. “Got hurt” is insufficient description. 127 C. 711. Hidden defect; constructive notice and duty of city to inspect. 128 C. 464. Failure to warn or safeguard against danger from flagstone upheaved by hurricane constituted violation of statutory duty, when city had ample means and opportunity. Id., 483. Cited.

Section applies to highway by dedication; common convenience and necessity with respect to establishment of highway reviewed. Id., 298. Where plaintiff slipped on ice which had filled up long-existing defect, city not liable on ground defect was cause of plaintiff's fall. Id., 410; 131 C. 239. Municipality not liable for negligence in performing function of construction and maintenance, but for defective condition which is proximate cause of injury; length of time defect in sidewalk must have existed in order to charge municipality with notice is question of fact. Id. Notice alleging “bruises on other parts of legs and body” inaccurate, but not a total failure of description preventing recovery for fracture of spine. Id., 430. Cited. 132 C. 395. City not liable where maintenance of nuisance by or negligence of another is a proximate cause of injury which concurred with sidewalk defect to bring it about. 134 C. 89. Duty of plaintiff to recite statutory notice given in complaint or to annex it thereto. Id., 569. Defect not too slight as matter of law to justify an award of damages; where hole was made and maintained by state, failure of city to repair was not sole proximate cause. Id., 686. Bottle of syrup on walk for 45 minutes does not warrant finding of constructive notice. Id., 694. Whether a condition of highway constitutes defect must be determined in each case upon the basis of its particular circumstances. 135 C. 469. From photographs of raised flagstone in sidewalk and other evidence, jury might reasonably have found that defendant had notice of defect. Id., 473. Elapsed time insufficient as a matter of law to sustain a finding of constructive notice and an opportunity of remedying the condition. Id., 484. Sidewalk within boundaries of state highway; where there was no finding that sidewalk was constructed by state it was held that, as between town and state, the town was liable for plaintiff's injuries. Id., 619. When city assumes control of sidewalks, it must exercise reasonable care to keep them in a reasonably safe condition. 136 C. 553. Cited. 137 C. 288. Statute is designed to protect travelers only; provides no right of recovery to an abutting landowner for damage from a defective highway. 138 C. 116. Cited. Id., 367; 139 C. 256; 140 C. 279. Constructive notice. 141 C. 126. Cited. 144 C. 282. Breach of duty on part of municipality must be shown. Id., 739. Special act of legislature validating notice given municipality does not constitute breach of cooperation clause in insurance policy by municipality. 145 C. 368. Unlike most negligence actions, plaintiff has burden of proving due care for action brought under statute. 147 C. 149. If certain portions of street are devoted to purpose other than travel, travelers leaving way provided for them and attempting to cross such reserved portions may not assume such portions are free from danger or unusual conditions. 148 C. 349. Ordinarily, the length of time a defect in a sidewalk must exist in order to charge a municipality with notice of its existence is a question of fact; defect must have existed for such a length of time that the city was charged with notice of it and had a reasonable opportunity to remedy the defect. Id., 548. What constitutes defect discussed. 150 C. 514. Where statutory notice relied solely on accumulated water, as distinguished from snow and ice, as the claimed defective condition and cause of the accident, and plaintiff testified that he actually lost control of his car on a film of ice, he cannot recover from the city. 151 C. 343. Cited. 153 C. 439; 159 C. 150; 162 C. 295; 167 C. 509. Overhanging tree limb which did not obstruct or hinder travel was not a “defect” in the highway. 177 C. 268. Cited. 183 C. 473. Sec. 52-572h does not apply to actions for personal injuries based on this statute; liability of defendant under statute is for breach of statutory duty and does not arise from negligence. 184 C. 205. Cited. 186 C. 229; Id., 300; Id., 692. Special act limiting liability of New Britain could not stand where clear policy statement in this section that municipal liability for damages should not be limited. 193 C. 589. Cited. 196 C. 509; 211 C. 370; 213 C. 307; Id., 446; 214 C. 1; 218 C. 1; 219 C. 179; Id., 641; 224 C. 23; 225 C. 177; Id., 217; 226 C. 282; Id., 757. Section does not bar an employer from seeking reimbursement under Sec. 31-293(a). 231 C. 370. Cited. 235 C. 408; 240 C. 105. In order for liability to obtain under section, defendant must have notice of an actual defect and not merely notice of potential defects or conditions likely to create a defect. 246 C. 638. Section invoked where plaintiff tripped on a portion of a steel sign post that had been cut off just above ground level while disembarking from bus that had stopped approximately 7 feet from the broken post; section is not void for vagueness as applied to facts of case. 255 C. 330. When town clerk's office is closed on the 90th day on which notice can be filed, it is sufficient to file notice on the next day on which the office is open; a party does not fail to give notice simply because the notice addresses the wrong name as town clerk. Id., 693. Sole proximate case doctrine precludes municipal liability where plaintiff is contributorily negligent and where other tortfeasors or independent nontortious factors contributed to the injury; therefore statute does not provide a right to indemnification. 258 C. 56. Under section, the focus with respect to the element of sole proximate cause is whether any factors other than municipality's breach of its statutory duty caused plaintiff's injury. Id., 574. Inaccurate notice under section is not, by itself, fatal to plaintiff's claim; the savings clause operates to protect plaintiffs from having their claims barred by reason of a vague, indefinite or inaccurate notice of accident location. 262 C. 787. Manner in which defect is created has no bearing on municipal liability under section and municipal liability was imposed where defect in highway created by third-party contractor was sole proximate cause of plaintiff's injuries. 292 C. 364. If injury complained of was caused by a highway defect on town road, plaintiff's only recourse against town is to pursue a claim under this section pursuant to the exclusivity provision of Sec. 52-557n(a)(1)(C), and plaintiff cannot maintain a separate nuisance action against town. 304 C. 298. Whether driveway upon which plaintiff was driving was public, thereby falling within the purview of section, or whether it was a private thoroughfare, thereby falling within the purview of Sec. 52-557n, is a question of fact to be determined by the trial court. 315 C. 606. Given that depressions in a roadway, potholes, are highway defects, it logically follows that an uncovered, open manhole, as a matter of law is also a highway defect. 346 C. 487."

Notice provisions discussed. 47 CA 365. Walkway deemed to be road or bridge since it was on public property leading from city street to public school and there was reasonable anticipation that the public would make use of it. Id., 734. Plaintiff could not prevail on claim that because section contains its own limitation period, court improperly relied on Sec. 52-584, which is applicable to negligence cases in general; trial court properly determined statute of limitations was not tolled during plaintiff's illness because this section contains no such tolling provision. 48 CA 60. Notice requirement not met where plaintiff's letter of notice did not arrive at town clerk's office until after the 90th day and where addressee on the letter was not a person employed in clerk's office or known to town clerk. 58 CA 191. Savings clause does not extend time requirement for delivery of notice. 67 CA 464. Plaintiff bears burden of proving delivery and actual receipt of notice. 72 CA 766. Notice by plaintiff's attorney that was received by town clerk more than 90 days from date of claimed injury and e-mail sent from plaintiff's supervisor to supervisor of a community center did not meet notice requirements of highway defect statute in order to invoke subject matter jurisdiction. 96 CA 387. Because there was no factual dispute that access to a transfer station was restricted and was, therefore, not open to the public, the court properly determined plaintiff's claim did not fall within the purview of the defective highway statute. 110 CA 657. Section and Sec. 13a-144 are not irreconcilably in conflict and do not prevent plaintiff from recovering from either state or municipal governmental entity if municipal employees caused a defect on a state highway because liability depends on existence of a defect, not the underlying causes which produced it. 116 CA 28. Failure to comply with Sec. 14-300c(a) demonstrated negligence on the part of plaintiff and precluded recovery under this section. 119 CA 724. Trial court properly concluded that plaintiff's claim fell within the purview of section and granted defendant's motion to dismiss for failure to comply with section's notice requirement because an improperly positioned storm drain cover located on a sidewalk is a defect in the highway and the facts admitted to in the pleadings name the defendant as the party bound to keep the property at issue in repair; highway defect statute is a legislative exception to the immunity of municipalities at common law and must be strictly construed. 125 CA 149. Common-law negligence is not applicable in a highway defect case; notice must be given under section and provide a general description of injuries sustained. 139 CA 487. Allegation that municipal road was unsafe for public travel because of a condition of the road caused by town's construction project is sufficient to satisfy pleading requirements of section, regardless of whether the claim is brought specifically under section. 143 CA 249. Because town defendants can only be held liable pursuant to section, and section requires that town defendants' conduct be sole proximate cause of damages alleged in order for liability to attach, any negligence on the part of third party negates possibility of relief from town defendants on theory of common-law indemnification. 147 CA 650. Where plaintiff exercises due care, failure to see sidewalk defect does not render plaintiff contributorily negligent. 148 CA 186. A public nuisance claim may not be brought independently of section when plaintiff's claim for damages against a municipality resulted from an injury sustained by means of a defective municipal road. 150 CA 805. Whether notice was sufficient under the savings clause was a question of law for the court. 157 CA 528."

With each request filed as provided in section 13a-186 for an authorization of securities pursuant to said sections 13a-184 to 13a-197 , inclusive, for any purpose described in section 13a-185 , there shall also be filed a certificate signed in the same manner as such request briefly identifying the projects for costs of which proceeds of the sale of such securities are to be used and expended and stating the amount of such proceeds to be so used and expended for the costs of each such project, together with a statement whether, in the opinion of the signer, all or any part of federal moneys then available or thereafter to be made available for costs in connection with any such project should be added to the state moneys available or becoming available hereunder for such project. If the certificate so filed with respect to any such project includes a statement that some amount of such federal moneys should be added to such state moneys, then, if and to the extent directed by the State Bond Commission at the time of authorization of such securities, said amount of such federal moneys then available or thereafter to be made available for costs in connection with such project may be added to any state moneys available or becoming available hereunder for such project and be used for such project as if constituting such state moneys, and any other federal moneys then available or thereafter to be made available in connection with such project, if and to the extent from time to time directed by the State Bond Commission, upon receipt shall, in conformity with applicable federal law, be used by the Treasurer to meet principal of outstanding securities issued pursuant to sections 13a-184 to 13a-197 , inclusive, or to meet the principal of temporary notes issued in anticipation of the money to be derived from the sale of securities theretofore authorized pursuant to said sections for the purpose of financing such costs, either by purchase or redemption and cancellation of such securities or notes or by payment thereof at maturity. Whenever any of the federal moneys so received with respect to such project are used to meet principal of such temporary notes or whenever principal of any of such temporary notes is retired by application of revenue receipts of the state, the amount of securities theretofore authorized in anticipation of which such temporary notes were issued, and the aggregate amount of securities which may be authorized pursuant to said sections with respect to said project, shall each be reduced by the amount of the principal so met or retired. Pending use of the federal moneys so received to meet principal, the amount thereof may be invested by the Treasurer in bonds or obligations of, or guaranteed by, the state or the United States or agencies or instrumentalities of the United States, and shall be deemed to be part of the debt retirement funds of the state, and net earnings on such investments shall be used in the same manner as the said moneys so invested."

With each request filed as provided in section 13a-198e for an authorization of said bonds for any purpose described in section 13a-198b , there shall also be filed a certificate signed in the same manner as such request briefly identifying the projects for costs of which proceeds of the sale of bonds are to be used and expended and stating the amount of such proceeds to be so used and expended for costs of each such project, together with a statement whether, in the opinion of the signer, all or any part of federal moneys then available or thereafter to be made available for costs in connection with any such project should be added to the state moneys available hereunder for such project. If the certificate so filed with respect to any such project includes a statement that some amount of such federal moneys should be added to such state moneys, then if and to the extent directed by the State Bond Commission at the time of authorization of such bonds, said amount of such federal moneys then available or thereafter to be made available for costs in connection with such project may be added to any state moneys available or becoming available hereunder for such project and be used for such project as if constituting such state moneys, and any other federal moneys then available or thereafter to be made available in connection with such project, if and to the extent from time to time directed by the State Bond Commission, upon receipt shall, in conformity with applicable federal law be used by the Treasurer to meet principal of outstanding bonds issued pursuant to section 13a-198a and sections 13a-198i and 13a-198j , or to meet the principal of temporary notes issued in anticipation of the money to be derived from the sale of bonds theretofore authorized pursuant to said sections for the purpose of financing such costs, either by purchase or redemption and cancellation of such bonds or notes or by payment thereof at maturity. Whenever any of the federal moneys so received with respect to such project are used to meet principal of such temporary notes or whenever principal of any of such temporary notes is retired by application of revenue receipts of the state, the amount of bonds theretofore authorized in anticipation of which such temporary notes were issued, and the aggregate amount of bonds which may be issued pursuant to said sections with respect to said project, shall each be reduced by the amount of the principal so met or retired. Pending use of the federal moneys so received to meet principal, the amount thereof may be invested by the Treasurer in bonds or obligations of, or guaranteed by, the state or the United States or agencies or instrumentalities of the United States, and shall be deemed to be part of the debt retirement funds of the state, and net earnings on such investments shall be used in the same manner as the said moneys so invested."
