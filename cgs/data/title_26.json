Upon the receipt of an application, on forms provided by the commissioner and containing such information as said commissioner may require, from any landowner who has or whose primary lessee has an actual or potential gross annual income of twenty-five hundred dollars or more from the commercial cultivated production of grain, forage, fruit, vegetables, flowers, ornamental plants or Christmas trees and who is experiencing an actual or potential loss of income because of severe damage by deer, the commissioner shall issue not more than six damage permits without fee to such landowner or the primary lessee of such landowner, or the wife, husband, lineal descendant or designated agent of such landowner or lessee. The application shall be notarized and signed by all landowners or by the landowner or a lessee to whom a farmer tax exemption permit has been issued pursuant to subdivision (63) of section 12-412 . Such damage permit shall be valid through October thirty-first of the year in which it is issued and may specify the hunting implement or shot size or both which shall be used to take such deer. The commissioner may at any time revoke such permit for violation of any provision of this section or for violation of any regulation pursuant thereto or upon the request of the applicant. Notwithstanding the provisions of section 26-85 , the commissioner may issue a permit to any landowner or primary lessee of land owned by such landowner or the husband or wife or any lineal descendant of such landowner or lessee and to not more than three designated agents of such landowner or lessee to use a jacklight for the purpose of taking deer when it is shown, to the satisfaction of the commissioner, that such deer are causing damage which cannot be reduced during the daylight hours between sunrise and one-half hour after sunset on the land of such landowner. The commissioner may require notification as specified on such permit prior to its use. Any deer killed in accordance with the provisions of this section shall be the property of the owner of the land upon which the same has been killed, but shall not be sold, bartered, traded or offered for sale, and the person who kills any such deer shall tag and report each deer killed, as provided in section 26-86b .

The commissioner may authorize any municipality, homeowner association or nonprofit land-holding organization approved by the commissioner under the provisions of this section to take deer at any time, other than Sundays, or place using any method consistent with professional wildlife management principles when a severe nuisance or ecological damage can be demonstrated to the satisfaction of the commissioner. Any such municipality, homeowner association or nonprofit land-holding organization shall submit to the commissioner, for the commissioner's review and approval, a plan that describes the extent and degree of the nuisance or ecological damage and the proposed methods of taking. Prior to the implementation of any such approved plan, the municipality, homeowner association or nonprofit land-holding organization shall provide notice of such plan to any abutting landowners of such place where the plan will be implemented. Such plan shall not authorize the use of a snare. No person shall hunt, pursue or kill deer being pursued by any dog, whether or not such dog is owned or controlled by such person, except that no person shall be guilty of a violation under this section when such a deer is struck by a motor vehicle operated by such person.

The commissioner may issue such license to qualified applicants upon the submission of an application, on forms provided by the commissioner, containing such information as prescribed by the commissioner. There shall be an annual fee of one hundred thirty dollars for each such license. Such license shall expire on the last day of December next after the issuance thereof. All legally acquired finfish and crustaceans hatched, reared or held in commercial hatcheries may be taken and sold at any time for the purpose of stocking other waters, for bait or for food, except that lobsters or blue crabs sold for any purpose other than for rearing in another commercial hatchery shall not have ova or spawn attached and must meet the minimum legal length requirements provided in subsection (a) of section 26-157a . Each owner or operator of any such hatchery shall keep such records as are required by the commissioner on forms provided by the commissioner which record shall be open to inspection by said commissioner or the commissioner's authorized agents at any time and a copy of such records shall be furnished to the commissioner by January thirty-first of the year following the year covered by the report. Representatives of the commissioner may enter upon the premises of any such licensed hatchery at any time to inspect any facility, equipment, impoundment or any finfish or crustaceans to determine the presence of disease or parasites. In such case said commissioner, when so requested, may render such technical assistance as is necessary and possible and may charge a reasonable fee for such services. In the event that the presence of disease or parasites is confirmed in finfish or crustaceans hatched, held or reared in such licensed hatchery said commissioner is authorized to suspend or revoke any such commercial hatchery license and issue an order prohibiting the sale, exchange or removal from such premises of such finfish or crustaceans, and direct such disposition of such remaining finfish or crustaceans including the eggs of such finfish or crustaceans as the commissioner determines would be in the public interest. Any person issued a license to operate a commercial finfish hatchery may charge a fee for the privilege of fishing in the waters included under said license and may sell any species of finfish removed therefrom, provided no sport fishing license shall be required. Said commissioner may adopt regulations, in accordance with the provisions of chapter 54, governing and prescribing the methods of taking such finfish and the conditions under which such finfish may be sold, removed from the premises, possessed and transported. Said commissioner may adopt regulations, in accordance with the provisions of chapter 54, governing and prescribing the method of taking particular species of finfish and the conditions under which such finfish may be removed from the premises, possessed and transported, without a sport fishing license, from artificial facilities at fairs, sportsmen's shows and at such other place as said commissioner authorizes. Persons operating such facilities shall not be required to pay a fee to said commissioner and such persons may charge a fee for the privilege of fishing in such water, provided any such facility and any finfish used in connection therewith may be inspected at any time by any representative of the department to determine the presence of disease or parasites. In the event the presence of disease or parasites is confirmed, any such representative may issue a written order directing that such facility be immediately closed to the public and directing such disposition of such remaining finfish as would be in the public interest. Any person who violates any provision of this section or any regulation adopted or order issued by the commissioner, or such representative, or any person who, without proper authorization, takes or attempts to take any finfish or crustacean from any waters described herein shall be guilty of a class D misdemeanor."

The authority herein conferred shall include the Cormell Reef, Portchester, Great Captain's Island, Field Point and Greenwich Point natural beds as located and described in section 3295 of the general statutes, revision of 1918. Any person desiring to lease grounds for such purpose shall make application in writing to the commissioner and all grounds leased by authority of the provisions of this section shall be leased to the highest responsible bidder, for a minimum fee of four dollars per acre. Such lease or lease renewal shall require the lessee to make a good faith effort to cultivate and harvest shellfish from the leased area. Such lease or lease renewal shall prohibit the lessee from entering a contract whereby the lessee agrees not to cultivate and harvest shellfish for any period of time. No lessee may enter an agreement with a third party that will prevent the lessee from carrying out the lessee's obligations under the lease unless the Department of Agriculture and the Attorney General have approved such agreement. The form of such application and lease shall be approved by the Attorney General, and all such leases shall be recorded in the records of the commissioner. No lease shall be granted to a resident of a state which does not lease shellfish grounds to residents of this state, except that any nonresident who was granted a lease on or before October 1, 1985, may, upon the expiration of such lease, apply for a renewal or further lease as provided in this section. The commissioner shall grant any such lease to nonresidents upon the same terms and conditions as to residents of this state. Any lessee or holder of shellfish grounds, on the expiration of any lease thereof which has been or which may be granted, having fulfilled all of such lessee's or holder's obligations under the lease shall, upon application to the commissioner, have preference in the reletting of such ground for a like term to that granted in the original lease, excluding the rental fee, which shall not be less than the minimum fee per acre as provided in this subsection. A lease renewal shall not be granted if the applicant is in arrears for rent on the original lease of such grounds. Such application for such renewal or further lease shall be granted without notice or advertisement of the pendency thereof; provided no renewal or further lease of such ground shall be granted when the commissioner, for cause, ceases to lease such ground for shellfish culture. All assignments or transfers of leases shall be subject to the approval of the commissioner and shall be recorded in his records.

Seventy-five per cent of the proceeds of such fee shall be deposited in the Shellfish Fund, established pursuant to section 26-237b , and in the expand and grow Connecticut agriculture account, established in section 22-38c . The commissioner shall determine the portion of such seventy-five per cent that shall be deposited in each account.

Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to prohibit the state or any lessee from recovering damages incurred by the state or the lessee caused by the installation, construction or presence of such utility line or public use structure.",

All provisions of section 26-192c shall apply to leases issued pursuant to this subsection. For purposes of this subsection, “small-scale aquaculture operation” means an aquaculture operation that either operates in one hundred fifty acres or less of shellfish grounds or that has operated for the production of shellfish for four or fewer years."

            "text": "(a) Except as provided in subsection (e) of this section, the Commissioner of Agriculture may lease in the name of the state, under such regulations as the commissioner may prescribe and for a period not longer than ten years, all shellfish areas that have been conveyed to the state or placed under state jurisdiction by the town of West Haven and any undesignated grounds, within the exclusive jurisdiction of the state, for the purpose of planting and cultivating shellfish. The authority herein conferred shall include the Cormell Reef, Portchester, Great Captain's Island, Field Point and Greenwich Point natural beds as located and described in section 3295 of the general statutes, revision of 1918. Any person desiring to lease grounds for such purpose shall make application in writing to the commissioner and all grounds leased by authority of the provisions of this section shall be leased to the highest responsible bidder, for a minimum fee of four dollars per acre. Such lease or lease renewal shall require the lessee to make a good faith effort to cultivate and harvest shellfish from the leased area. Such lease or lease renewal shall prohibit the lessee from entering a contract whereby the lessee agrees not to cultivate and harvest shellfish for any period of time. No lessee may enter an agreement with a third party that will prevent the lessee from carrying out the lessee's obligations under the lease unless the Department of Agriculture and the Attorney General have approved such agreement. The form of such application and lease shall be approved by the Attorney General, and all such leases shall be recorded in the records of the commissioner. No lease shall be granted to a resident of a state which does not lease shellfish grounds to residents of this state, except that any nonresident who was granted a lease on or before October 1, 1985, may, upon the expiration of such lease, apply for a renewal or further lease as provided in this section. The commissioner shall grant any such lease to nonresidents upon the same terms and conditions as to residents of this state. Any lessee or holder of shellfish grounds, on the expiration of any lease thereof which has been or which may be granted, having fulfilled all of such lessee's or holder's obligations under the lease shall, upon application to the commissioner, have preference in the reletting of such ground for a like term to that granted in the original lease, excluding the rental fee, which shall not be less than the minimum fee per acre as provided in this subsection. A lease renewal shall not be granted if the applicant is in arrears for rent on the original lease of such grounds. Such application for such renewal or further lease shall be granted without notice or advertisement of the pendency thereof; provided no renewal or further lease of such ground shall be granted when the commissioner, for cause, ceases to lease such ground for shellfish culture. All assignments or transfers of leases shall be subject to the approval of the commissioner and shall be recorded in his records. Any person who interferes with, annoys or molests another in the enjoyment of any lease authorized by the provisions of this section shall be subject to the penalties provided in section 26-237 . The provisions of sections 26-212 , 26-215 and 26-232 shall not apply to any shellfish grounds leased pursuant to the provisions of this section.\n\n(b) Upon request of a lessee, the commissioner may divide or consolidate shellfish grounds leased by such lessee, if the commissioner determines such division or consolidation to be in the best interests of the state. The minimum fee per acre shall apply to shellfish grounds divided or consolidated pursuant to this subsection.\n\n(c) The Commissioner of Agriculture shall assess the owner of any facility that requires a certificate issued pursuant to section 16-50k or that requires approval by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and that crosses any grounds of Long Island Sound within the jurisdiction of the state, including, but not limited to, any shellfish area or leased, designated or granted grounds, an annual host payment fee of forty cents per linear foot for the length of such facility within the jurisdiction of the state. Seventy-five per cent of the proceeds of such fee shall be deposited in the Shellfish Fund, established pursuant to section 26-237b , and in the expand and grow Connecticut agriculture account, established in section 22-38c . The commissioner shall determine the portion of such seventy-five per cent that shall be deposited in each account. The commissioner shall transfer the remaining twenty-five per cent of such proceeds to the General Fund.\n\n(d) Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (a) of this section, any owner of a utility line or public use structure that impacts a leased area shall pay to the lessee the costs of removing or relocating any shellfish. Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to prohibit the state or any lessee from recovering damages incurred by the state or the lessee caused by the installation, construction or presence of such utility line or public use structure.\n\n(e) The commissioner may designate to each regional agricultural science and technology education center, established pursuant to section 10-64 , shellfish areas described in subsection (a) of this section that are necessary for conducting educational grow-out activities related to commercial scale aquaculture operations within state jurisdictional waters, provided: (1) The total acreage designated pursuant to this subsection for each such center is not more than fifty acres of restricted relay grow-out beds and fifty acres of approved harvest beds; and (2) any shellfish areas designated pursuant to this subsection are not in production at the time of such designation.\n\n(f) The Commissioner of Agriculture may designate an agent within the department to exercise the authority of said commissioner under this section.\n\n(g) The Commissioner of Agriculture shall encourage the development and expansion of new and existing small-scale aquaculture operations for shellfish. The commissioner may designate shellfish grounds available for annual leasing to such small-scale aquaculture operations under the provisions of subsection (a) of this section, except that the commissioner may require that all bidders be a small-scale aquaculture operation or offer such leases at a fixed price determined by the commissioner. Each applicant and all required individuals associated with the applicant shall have obtained the necessary licenses under this chapter prior to the commencement of the lease. All provisions of section 26-192c shall apply to leases issued pursuant to this subsection. For purposes of this subsection, “small-scale aquaculture operation” means an aquaculture operation that either operates in one hundred fifty acres or less of shellfish grounds or that has operated for the production of shellfish for four or fewer years."

Any vacancies that may from time to time occur shall be filled for the balance of the unexpired term by the board of selectmen of the town which, because of such vacancy, has one less member on said commission. Said commission may prohibit the taking of scallops, clams and oysters from such portions of the Niantic River as it designates, for a period not exceeding one year at a time, designate, from time to time, the manner in which said shellfish may be taken and license such taking and, in connection therewith, adopt reasonable regulations and fix license and permit fees. When said commission designates any place or places in said river from which the taking of scallops, oysters and clams is to be prohibited or designates a new manner in which scallops, clams and oysters may or may not be taken, or adopts, rescinds or amends any regulation or license or permit fee adopted hereunder, it shall cause to be published at least twice, in a newspaper having a circulation in each of said towns, a notice describing the place or places upon which such prohibition is to be operative or the manner in which scallops, oysters or clams may or may not be taken, or the regulation, license or permit fee adopted, rescinded or amended, and shall post copies of such notices upon the shores of the river. No person shall take any scallops, oysters or clams from any grounds from which the taking of the same has been prohibited during the time of such prohibition nor in any manner in violation of any such designation or regulation.\n\n(b) No person shall, at any time, take any scallops which may pass through a two and one-half inch ring or more than three bushels of scallops in any one day, provided said commission may increase or decrease the daily limit at any time after it has been in force for thirty days.\n\n(c) All constables and other informing officers of either of said towns shall inquire after and prosecute for any violation of this section. For the purpose of enforcing the same, all constables in either of said towns shall have supervision and jurisdiction over that part of the waters of the Niantic River from Golden Spur Bridge southerly to the highway bridge at the Rope Ferry Road, so called, and all offenses committed within said limits, in the same manner and to the same extent as though said portion of said river was within the town within which such officials have jurisdiction.\n\n(d) Said commission may designate special officers for the enforcement of this section whose compensation shall be determined by the commission. All moneys collected by either the town of Waterford or the town of East Lyme under the provisions of this section shall be paid to the commission and used by it for the protection and propagation of scallops, oysters and clams and other shellfish in the waters of the Niantic River.\n\n(e) Any person who violates any provision of this section or any regulation adopted pursuant to this section shall be fined not more than two hundred fifty dollars, and upon conviction the court may order that such person shall not be entitled to a permit or license to take scallops, oysters and clams from the Niantic River until the beginning of the second season the river is opened by the commission following such conviction."

It is not the purpose of this compact to authorize the states joining herein to limit the production of fish or fish products for the purpose of establishing or fixing the price thereof, or creating and perpetuating monopoly.\n\nARTICLE II\n\nThis agreement shall become operative immediately as to those states executing it whenever any two or more of the states of Maine, New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut, New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia and Florida have executed it in the form that is in accordance with the laws of the executing state and the Congress has given its consent. Any state contiguous with any of the aforementioned states and riparian upon waters frequented by anadromous fish, flowing into waters under the jurisdiction of any of the aforementioned states, may become a party hereto as hereinafter provided.\n\nARTICLE III\n\nEach state joining herein shall appoint three representatives to a commission hereby constituted and designated as the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission. One shall be the executive officer of the administrative agency of such state charged with the conservation of the fisheries resources to which this compact pertains or, if there be more than one officer or agency, the official of that state named by the governor thereof. The second shall be a member of the legislature of such state designated by the commission or committee on interstate cooperation of such state, or if there be none, or if said commission on interstate cooperation cannot constitutionally designate the said member, such legislator shall be designated by the governor thereof: Provided, that if it is constitutionally impossible to appoint a legislator as a commissioner from such state, the second member shall be appointed by the governor of said state in his discretion. The third shall be a citizen who shall have a knowledge of and interest in the marine fisheries problem to be appointed by the governor. The commission shall be a body corporate with the powers and duties set forth herein.\n\nARTICLE IV\n\nThe duty of the said commission shall be to make inquiry and ascertain from time to time such methods, practices, circumstances and conditions as may be disclosed for bringing about the conservation and the prevention of the depletion and physical waste of the fisheries, marine, shell and anadromous, of the Atlantic seaboard. The commission shall have power to recommend the coordination of the exercise of the police powers of the several states within their respective jurisdictions to promote the preservation of those fisheries and their protection against overfishing, waste, depletion or any abuse whatsoever and to assure a continuing yield from the fisheries resources of the aforementioned states.\n\nTo that end the commission shall draft and, after consultation with the advisory committee hereinafter authorized, recommend to the governors and legislatures of the various signatory states legislation dealing with the conservation of the marine, shell and anadromous fisheries of the Atlantic seaboard. The commission shall, more than one month prior to any regular meeting of the legislature in any signatory state, present to the governor of the state its recommendations relating to enactments to be made by the legislature of that state in furthering the intents and purposes of this compact.\n\nThe commission shall consult with and advise the pertinent administrative agencies in the states party hereto with regard to problems connected with the fisheries and recommend the adoption of such regulations as it deems advisable.\n\nThe commission shall have power to recommend to the states party hereto the stocking of the waters of such states with fish and fish eggs or joint stocking by some or all of the states party hereto and when two or more of the states shall jointly stock waters, the commission shall act as the coordinating agency for such stocking.\n\nARTICLE V\n\nThe commission shall elect from its number a chairman and a vice chairman and shall appoint and at its pleasure remove or discharge such officers and employees as may be required to carry the provisions of this compact into effect and shall fix and determine their duties, qualifications and compensation. Said commission shall adopt rules and regulations for the conduct of its business. It may establish and maintain one or more offices for the transaction of its business and may meet at any time or place but must meet at least once a year.\n\nARTICLE VI\n\nNo action shall be taken by the commission in regard to its general affairs except by the affirmative vote of a majority of the whole number of compacting states present at any meeting. No recommendation shall be made by the commission in regard to any species of fish except by the affirmative vote of a majority of the compacting states which have an interest in such species. The commission shall define what shall be an interest.\n\nARTICLE VII\n\nThe Fish and Wildlife Service of the Department of the Interior of the government of the United States shall act as the primary research agency of the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission cooperating with the research agencies in each state for that purpose. Representatives of the said Fish and Wildlife Service shall attend the meetings of the commission.\n\nAn advisory committee to be representative of the commercial fishermen and the salt water anglers and such other interests of each state as the commission deems advisable shall be established by the commission as soon as practicable for the purpose of advising the commission upon such recommendations as it may desire to make.\n\nARTICLE VIII\n\nWhen any state other than those named specifically in article II of this compact shall become a party thereto for the purpose of conserving its anadromous fish in accordance with the provisions of article II the participation of such state in the action of the commission shall be limited to such species of anadromous fish.\n\nARTICLE IX\n\nNothing in this compact shall be construed to limit the powers of any signatory state or to repeal or prevent the enactment of any legislation or the enforcement of any requirement by any signatory state imposing additional conditions and restrictions to conserve its fisheries.\n\nARTICLE X\n\nContinued absence of representation or of any representative on the commission from any state party hereto shall be brought to the attention of the governor thereof.\n\nARTICLE XI\n\nThe states party hereto agree to make annual appropriation to the support of the commission in proportion to the primary market value of the products of their fisheries, exclusive of cod and haddock, as recorded in the most recent published reports of the Fish and Wildlife Service of the United States Department of the Interior, provided no state shall contribute less than two hundred dollars per annum and the annual contribution of each state above the minimum shall be figured to the nearest one hundred dollars.\n\nThe compacting states agree to appropriate initially the annual amounts scheduled below, which amounts are calculated in the manner set forth herein, on the basis of the catch record of 1938. Subsequent budgets shall be recommended by majority of the commission and the cost thereof allocated equitably among the states in accordance with the respective interests and submitted to the compacting states.\n\nSchedule of Initial Annual States Contributions:\n\nMaine ...................................................................................... $ 700\n\nNew Hampshire ...................................................................... 200\n\nMassachusetts ......................................................................... 2300\n\nRhode Island ........................................................................... 300\n\nConnecticut ............................................................................. 400\n\nNew York ................................................................................ 1300\n\nNew Jersey .............................................................................. 800\n\nDelaware ................................................................................. 200\n\nMaryland ................................................................................. 700\n\nVirginia .................................................................................... 1300\n\nNorth Carolina ......................................................................... 600\n\nSouth Carolina ......................................................................... 200\n\nGeorgia .................................................................................... 200\n\nFlorida ...................................................................................... 1500\n\nARTICLE XII\n\nThis compact shall continue in force and remain binding upon each compacting state until renounced by it.

            "text": "The state of Connecticut hereby agrees with the states of Massachusetts, New Hampshire and Vermont, upon enactment by each of them of legislation having the same effect as this section and upon consent of the Congress of the United States, to the following compact:\n\nCONNECTICUT RIVER ATLANTIC SALMON COMPACT\n\nARTICLE I\n\nThe party States, for the purpose of promoting the restoration of Anadromous Atlantic salmon, hereinafter referred to as Atlantic salmon, to the Connecticut River basin by the development of a regional program for stocking, protection, management, research and regulation, do hereby establish the Connecticut River Atlantic Salmon Commission.\n\nARTICLE II\n\nEach state joining herein shall appoint two representatives to said commission. One shall be the executive officer of the administrative agency of such state charged with the management of the fisheries resources to which this compact pertains, or his designee. The second shall be a member of the public who shall have a knowledge of and interest in Atlantic salmon, to be appointed by the governor for a term of three years. The director of the northeast region of the Fish and Wildlife Service, United States Department of the Interior or his designee and the director of the northeast region of the National Marine Fisheries Service, United States Department of Commerce or his designee shall be members of said commission. The commission shall be a body corporate with the powers and duties set forth herein.\n\nARTICLE III\n\nThe duty of said commission shall be to make inquiry and ascertain from time to time such methods, practices, circumstances and conditions as may be disclosed for bringing about the restoration of Atlantic salmon to the Connecticut River and its tributaries.\n\nTo promote the restoration, preservation and protection of Atlantic salmon in the Connecticut River basin the commission may draft and recommend to the governors of the various signatory states legislation to accomplish this end. The commission shall, more than sixty days prior to any regular meeting of the legislature of any signatory state, present to the governor of the state its recommendations relating to proposed enactments to be made by the legislature of the state in furthering the intents and purposes of this compact.\n\nThe commission shall have the power to recommend to the states party hereto stocking programs, management procedures and research projects and when two or more states party hereto shall jointly stock waters or undertake cooperative management or research, the commission shall act as the coordinating agency. The commission using all available means, shall encourage acquisition by the signatory states of river bank, river bed and access thereto.\n\nThe commission shall consult with and advise the pertinent administrative agencies in the signatory states with regard to other anadromous species and their potential impact or the potential impact of sport fisheries and commercial fisheries for other anadromous species on the restoration of Atlantic salmon to the Connecticut River basin.\n\nIn the interest of developing a sound program of Atlantic salmon management, the commission shall promulgate regulations governing Atlantic salmon fishing in the main stem of the Connecticut River in all four signatory states as hereinafter provided. Such regulations may: (1) Establish the open and closed seasons for Atlantic salmon which may vary by river section, (2) establish hours, days of period during the open season when fishing for Atlantic salmon shall not be permitted in designated areas, (3) prescribe the legal methods of taking Atlantic salmon including the type of gear such as gaffs, landing nets or tailers which may be used to assist in landing such fish, (4) establish the minimum legal length for Atlantic salmon and (5) establish the daily creel limit, the season creel limit and the possession limit for Atlantic salmon. The commission shall recommend, review and issue comments on such regulations as may be promulgated by the signatory states governing Atlantic salmon fishing in tributary streams. The states of Connecticut and Massachusetts agree to make available for brook stock, from fish taken in the fish passage facilities at the Rainbow Reservoir Dam and the Holyoke Power Company Dam, such numbers of adult Atlantic salmon as the commission deems necessary to carry out the Atlantic salmon restoration program.\n\nThe commission shall have the power to issue a Connecticut River Basin Atlantic Salmon License and the sale of such licenses shall be handled by the individual signatory states or their authorized agents. The individual signatory states shall be accountable to the commission for all such licenses and the moneys received therefrom. The initial fee for such licenses shall be determined by majority vote of the commission but shall not exceed the maximum resident angling license fee of the signatory states except that the commission may upon a determination of need and with the unanimous approval of its membership increase such license and issuing fee. The individual signatory states or their issuing agents may retain a recording fee of up to fifty cents for each license issued. Forms for such license shall be provided to the signatory states by the commission. Such license shall be a legal prerequisite for any person including minors fishing for or possessing Atlantic salmon in the waters or on the shores of the Connecticut River and all of its tributaries. In addition to said Connecticut River Basin Atlantic Salmon License, all persons, except those specifically exempted because of age, disability or other limitation as determined by statute or regulations of the individual signatory states shall be required to possess a valid resident or nonresident sport fishing license issued by the state in which such person is fishing. The commission shall recognize that in certain waters or sections of waters a daily rod permit may also be required, such daily rod permit to be issued by the state in which such waters or sections of waters are located, however, the signatory states shall not, by fee, distinguish between residents and nonresidents. The authority to limit the numbers of persons fishing for Atlantic salmon in certain tributaries or sections of certain tributaries shall remain the prerogative of the individual signatory states.\n\nThe respective police agencies of the signatory states shall have the authority to enforce all of the regulations and license requirements of the commission any place in the Connecticut River basin.\n\nThe commission shall have the authority to accept gifts, state grants and federal funds. The commission shall have the authority to expend money from fees collected for Connecticut River Basin Atlantic Salmon Licenses or from such other funds available to the commission to finance the cost of stocking, management or research carried on by signatory states to further the purposes of this compact. Such funds shall be in the form of direct grants to the agency of such state charged with the management of the fisheries resources and may be up to one hundred per cent of the cost of projects approved by a majority vote of the commission.\n\nARTICLE IV\n\nThe commission shall elect from its number a chairman and a vice chairman and at its pleasure may remove such officers. Said commission shall adopt rules and regulations for the conduct of its business. At such time as funds are available to the commission the commission may establish and maintain an office for the transaction of its business. The commission may meet at any time or place but must meet at least semiannually.\n\nThe commission shall have the authority to expend money from available commission funds to reimburse its membership for necessary travel expenses.\n\nARTICLE V\n\nAt such time as funds are available the commission may employ and discharge at its pleasure such personnel as may be required to carry out the provisions of this compact and shall fix and determine their duties, qualifications and compensation.\n\nARTICLE VI\n\nThere shall be established a technical committee to consist of one fishery biologist from each of the signatory states, the United States Fish and Wildlife Service and the National Marine Fisheries Service to act in an advisory capacity to the commission. The technical committee shall have the authority to request employees of the signatory states, the United States Fish and Wildlife Service and the National Marine Fisheries Service or others who have special fields of expertise to act as special advisors to the committee. At such time as funds are available the commission may reimburse technical committee members and special advisors for necessary travel expenses.\n\nARTICLE VII\n\nNo action shall be taken by the commission in regard to its general affairs except by affirmative vote of a majority of members present at any meeting, provided there is a quorum. A quorum shall consist of a simple majority of all members of the commission. No action shall be taken at any meeting of the commission unless each signatory state is represented at any such meeting. No recommendation or allotment of grant funds shall be made by the commission except by the affirmative vote of a majority of the members.\n\nARTICLE VIII\n\nContinued absence of representation or of any representative on the commission from any party hereto shall be brought to the attention of the governor thereof.\n\nARTICLE IX\n\nThe states signatory hereto agree to make an annual appropriation to the initial support of the commission in the amount of one thousand dollars for each of the first three years that this compact is in effect.\n\nARTICLE X\n\nThe commission shall keep accurate accounts of all receipts and disbursements and shall report to the governor and the legislature of each state party to this compact on or before the tenth day of January of each year, setting forth in detail the transactions conducted by it during the twelve months preceding January first of that year. The Comptroller of the state of Connecticut is hereby authorized and empowered from time to time to examine the accounts and books of the commission, including its receipts, disbursements, grants and such other items referring to its financial standing as such Comptroller may deem proper and to report the results of such examination to the governor of said state."
