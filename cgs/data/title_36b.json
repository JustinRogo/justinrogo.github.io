An investment adviser agent registered under sections 36b-2 to 36b-34 , inclusive, who refers advisory clients to another investment adviser registered under said sections 36b-2 to 36b-34 , inclusive, or to an investment adviser registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission that has filed a notice under subsection (e) of this section, is not required to register as an investment adviser agent of such investment adviser if the only compensation paid for such referral services is paid to the investment adviser with whom the individual is employed or associated. No individual shall transact business, directly or indirectly, in this state as an investment adviser agent on behalf of an investment adviser if the registration of such individual as an investment adviser agent is suspended or revoked or the individual is barred from employment or association with an investment adviser by an order of the commissioner, the Securities and Exchange Commission or a self-regulatory organization.\n\n(3) No investment adviser shall engage an investment adviser agent unless such investment adviser agent is registered under sections 36b-2 to 36b-34 , inclusive. The registration of an investment adviser agent is not effective during any period when such investment adviser agent is not associated with a particular investment adviser. When an investment adviser agent begins or terminates a connection with an investment adviser, both the investment adviser agent and the investment adviser shall promptly notify the commissioner. If an investment adviser or investment adviser agent provides such notice, such investment adviser or investment adviser agent shall not be liable for the failure of the other to give such notice.\n\n(d) No broker-dealer or investment adviser shall transact business from any place of business located within this state unless that place of business is registered as a branch office with the commissioner pursuant to this subsection.

A broker-dealer or investment adviser shall promptly notify the commissioner in writing if such broker-dealer or investment adviser (1) engages a new manager at a branch office in this state, (2) acquires a branch office of another broker-dealer or investment adviser in this state, or (3) relocates a branch office in this state. In the case of a branch office acquisition or relocation, such broker-dealer or investment adviser shall pay to the commissioner a nonrefundable fee of one hundred twenty-five dollars. Each registrant or applicant for branch office registration shall pay the actual cost, as determined by the commissioner, of any reasonable investigation or examination made of such registrant or applicant by or on behalf of the commissioner.\n\n(e) The following investment advisers are exempted from the registration requirements under subsection (c) of this section: Any investment adviser that (1) is registered or required to be registered under Section 203 of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940; (2) is excepted from the definition of investment adviser under Section 202(a)(11) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940; or (3) has no place of business in this state and, during the preceding twelve months, has had no more than five clients who are residents of this state. Any investment adviser claiming an exemption pursuant to subdivision (1) of this subsection that is not otherwise excluded under subsection (11) of section 36b-3 , shall first file with the commissioner a notice of exemption together with a consent to service of process as required by subsection (g) of section 36b-33 and shall pay to the commissioner or to any person designated by the commissioner in writing to collect such fee on behalf of the commissioner a nonrefundable fee of two hundred seventy-five dollars. The notice of exemption shall contain such information as the commissioner may require. Such notice of exemption shall be valid until December thirty-first of the calendar year in which it was first filed and may be renewed annually thereafter upon submission of such information as the commissioner may require together with a nonrefundable fee of one hundred seventy-five dollars. If any investment adviser that is exempted from registration pursuant to subdivision (1) of this subsection fails or refuses to pay any fee required by this subsection, the commissioner may require such investment adviser to register pursuant to subsection (c) of this section. For purposes of this subsection, a delay in the payment of a fee or an underpayment of a fee which is promptly remedied shall not constitute a failure or refusal to pay such fee.\n\n(f) Any broker-dealer or investment adviser ceasing to transact business at any branch office or main office in this state shall, in addition to providing written notice to the commissioner prior to the termination of business activity at that office, (1) provide written notice to each customer or client serviced by such office at least ten business days prior to the termination of business activity at that office, or (2) demonstrate to the commissioner, in writing, the reasons why such notice to customers or clients cannot be provided within the time prescribed. If the commissioner finds that the broker-dealer or investment adviser cannot provide notice to customers or clients at least ten business days prior to the termination of business activity, the commissioner may exempt the broker-dealer or investment adviser from giving such notice. The commissioner shall act upon a request for such exemption within five business days following receipt by the commissioner of the written request for such an exemption. The notice to customers or clients shall contain the following information: The date and reasons why business activity will terminate at the office; if applicable, a description of the procedure the customer or client may follow to maintain the customer's account at any other office of the broker-dealer or investment adviser; the procedure for transferring the customer's or client's account to another broker-dealer or investment adviser; and the procedure for making delivery to the customer or client of any funds or securities held by the broker-dealer or investment adviser.\n\n(g) Any broker-dealer or investment adviser ceasing to transact business at any branch office or main office in this state as a result of executing an agreement and plan of merger or acquisition shall provide written notice to the commissioner and to each customer or client serviced by such office not later than the date such merger or acquisition is completed. The notice provided to each customer or client shall contain the information specified in subsection (f) of this section.\n\n(h) Any broker-dealer or investment adviser ceasing to transact business at any branch office or main office in this state as a result of the commencement of a bankruptcy proceeding by such broker-dealer or investment adviser or by a creditor or creditors of such broker-dealer or investment adviser shall, immediately upon the filing of a petition with the bankruptcy court, provide written notice to the commissioner. The commissioner shall determine the time and manner in which notice shall be provided to each customer or client serviced by such office.\n\n(i) (1) A broker-dealer or investment adviser may succeed to the current registration of another broker-dealer or investment adviser or to a notice filing of an investment adviser registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission, and an investment adviser registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission may succeed to the current registration of an investment adviser or to a notice filing of another investment adviser registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission, by filing as a successor an application for registration pursuant to section 36b-7 or a notice pursuant to subsection (e) of this section for the unexpired portion of the current registration or notice filing and paying the fee required by subsection (a) of section 36b-12 .\n\n(2) A broker-dealer or investment adviser that changes its form of organization or state of incorporation or organization may continue its registration by filing an amendment to its registration if the change does not involve a material change in its management. The amendment shall become effective when filed or on a date designated by the registrant in its filing. The new organization shall be a successor to the original registrant for the purposes of sections 36b-2 to 36b-34 , inclusive. If there is a material change in management, the broker-dealer or investment adviser shall file a new application for registration. A predecessor registered under sections 36b-2 to 36b-34 , inclusive, shall stop conducting its securities business or investment advisory business other than winding down transactions and shall file for withdrawal of its broker-dealer or investment adviser registration not later than forty-five days after filing its amendment to effect succession.\n\n(3) A broker-dealer or investment adviser that changes its name may continue its registration by filing an amendment to its registration. The amendment shall become effective when filed or on a date designated by the registrant.\n\n(4) The commissioner may, by regulation adopted, in accordance with chapter 54, or order, prescribe the means by which a change of control of a broker-dealer or investment adviser may be made.\n\n(5) Nothing in this subsection shall relieve a registrant of its obligation to pay agent and investment adviser agent transfer fees as described in subsection (d) of section 36b-12 .\n\n(j) The commissioner may, by regulation adopted, in accordance with chapter 54, or order, require an agent or investment adviser agent to participate in a continuing education program approved by the Securities and Exchange Commission and administered by a self-regulatory organization or, in the absence of such a program, the commissioner may require continuing education for registered investment adviser agents by regulation or order.\n\n(k) For purposes of subsections (d), (f), (g) and (h) of this section, “investment adviser” means an investment adviser registered or required to be registered with the commissioner.\n\n(l) The commissioner may by rule, regulation or order, conditionally or unconditionally, exempt from the requirements of this section any person or class of persons upon a finding that such exemption is in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of this chapter."

If the broker-dealer or investment adviser, upon the expiration of any such longer period of time or completion of a review of such additional information, does not accept the power of attorney, the temporary hold shall be continued for not longer than fifty calendar days following the date on which the power of attorney was received by the broker-dealer or investment adviser.\n\n(F) Nothing in this subdivision shall preclude the Banking Commissioner, the Commissioner of Social Services or the Probate Court from sooner terminating or extending the temporary hold upon contemporaneous written notice to the broker-dealer or investment adviser.\n\n(5) (A) A registered broker-dealer or investment adviser shall provide access to, or copies of, records that are relevant to the suspected or attempted financial exploitation of an eligible adult to the commissioner and to a law enforcement agency, as part of a referral to the commissioner or a law enforcement agency, or upon a request made by the commissioner or law enforcement agency pursuant to an investigation or examination, as the case may be. Nothing in this subsection shall limit or otherwise impede the authority of the commissioner to access or examine the books and records of broker-dealers and investment advisers as provided by other applicable law. All records made available to agencies under this subsection shall not be considered public records for purposes of chapter 14. Pursuant to subsection (c) of section 36b-31 , the commissioner may share and exchange with affected social services regulators information and documents related to the suspected financial exploitation.\n\n(B) (i) In the case of a broker-dealer, such records relevant to the suspected or attempted financial exploitation, described in subparagraph (A) of this subdivision, shall include the records prescribed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and the regulations thereunder, as amended from time to time, and applicable self-regulatory organization rules.\n\n(ii) In the case of an investment adviser registered or required to be registered with the commissioner, such records relevant to the suspected or attempted financial exploitation, described in subparagraph (A) of this subdivision, shall include documentation: (I) Of relevant requests for disbursements; (II) supporting any disbursement delay; (III) supporting the investment adviser's reasonable belief that financial exploitation has occurred or is occurring; (IV) of the name and title of the person authorizing the disbursement delay; (V) of notifications to affected parties; and (VI) relating to the investment adviser's internal review of the matter.\n\n(6) A broker-dealer or investment adviser subject to this subsection shall, to the extent not inconsistent with federal law, develop training policies or programs reasonably designed to ensure that qualified persons understand and can effectively carry out the provisions of this subsection where necessary, including, but not limited to, training on the Connecticut Uniform Power of Attorney Act, sections 1-350 to 1-353b , inclusive, and how it relates to financial exploitation.\n\n(7) A broker-dealer or investment adviser that, in good faith and exercising reasonable care, complies with this subsection shall be immune from any administrative or civil liability that might otherwise arise from any action taken by such broker-dealer or investment adviser that is permitted by this subsection.\n\n(8) Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to limit any immunities, causes of action or remedies provided under the Connecticut Uniform Power of Attorney Act, sections 1-350 to 1-353b , inclusive.\n\n(9) If an eligible adult or a co-owner of an account of an eligible adult is an applicant for, or recipient of, means-tested benefits under chapters 319s to 319oo, inclusive, the Commissioner of Social Services shall consider any funds or securities subject to a temporary hold under subdivision (4) of this subsection to be unavailable assets for each owner or co-owner of the account while such temporary hold is in effect."

              "(b) The following provisions govern the application of subparagraph (J) of subdivision (2) of subsection (a) of this section: (1) The commissioner may not enter an order against a broker-dealer on the basis of the lack of qualification of any person other than (A) the broker-dealer if the broker-dealer is an individual, or (B) an agent of the broker-dealer; (2) the commissioner may not enter an order against an investment adviser on the basis of the lack of qualification of any person other than (A) the investment adviser if the investment adviser is an individual, or (B) any other person who represents the investment adviser in doing any of the acts which make the investment adviser an investment adviser; (3) the commissioner may not enter an order solely on the basis of lack of experience if the applicant or registrant is qualified by training or knowledge or both; (4) the commissioner shall consider that an agent who will work under the supervision of a registered broker-dealer need not have the same qualifications as a broker-dealer; (5) the commissioner shall consider that an investment adviser is not necessarily qualified solely on the basis of experience as a broker-dealer or agent. When the commissioner finds that an applicant for initial or renewal registration as a broker-dealer is not qualified as an investment adviser, the commissioner may by order condition the applicant's registration as a broker-dealer upon the applicant's not transacting business in this state as an investment adviser; (6) the commissioner may by regulation provide for an examination, which may be written or oral or both, to be taken by any class of or all applicants, as well as persons who represent or will represent an investment adviser in doing any of the acts which make the investment adviser an investment adviser.",
              "(c) The commissioner may by order summarily postpone or suspend registration or require a registrant to take or refrain from taking such action that in the opinion of the commissioner will effectuate the purposes of sections 36b-2 to 36b-34 , inclusive, pending final determination of any proceeding under this section. Upon the entry of the order, the commissioner shall promptly notify the applicant or registrant, as well as the employer or prospective employer if the applicant or registrant is an agent or an investment adviser agent, that it has been entered and of the reasons therefor and that within fifteen days after the receipt of a written request the matter will be set down for hearing. If no hearing is requested and none is ordered by the commissioner, the order will remain in effect until it is modified or vacated by the commissioner. If a hearing is requested or ordered, the commissioner, after notice of and opportunity for hearing, may modify or vacate the order or extend it until final determination.",
              "(d) If the commissioner finds that any registrant or applicant for registration is no longer in existence or has ceased to do business as a broker-dealer, agent, investment adviser or investment adviser agent, or is subject to an adjudication of mental incompetence or to the control of a committee, conservator, or guardian, or cannot be located after reasonable search, the commissioner may by order cancel the registration or application.",
              "(e) (1) Withdrawal from registration as a broker-dealer, agent, investment adviser or investment adviser agent, or withdrawal of an application for registration as a broker-dealer, agent, investment adviser or investment adviser agent, becomes effective ninety days after receipt of an application to withdraw such registration or a notice of intent to withdraw such application for registration or within such shorter period of time as the commissioner may determine, unless a denial, revocation or suspension proceeding is pending when the application or notice is filed or a proceeding to deny, revoke, suspend or impose conditions upon the withdrawal is instituted within ninety days after the application or notice is filed. If a proceeding is pending or instituted, withdrawal becomes effective at such time and upon such conditions as the commissioner by order determines. If no proceeding is pending or instituted and withdrawal automatically becomes effective, the commissioner may nevertheless institute a denial, revocation or suspension proceeding under subsection (a) of this section within one year after withdrawal became effective.",
              "(2) If the registration of a broker-dealer, agent, investment adviser or investment adviser agent expires due to the registrant's failure to renew, within one year of such expiration, the commissioner may nevertheless institute a revocation or suspension proceeding or issue an order suspending or revoking the registration under subsection (a) of this section.",
              "(f) No order may be entered under this section except as provided in subsection (c) of this section without (1) appropriate prior notice to the applicant or registrant and to the employer or prospective employer if such applicant or registrant is an agent or investment adviser agent, (2) opportunity for hearing, and (3) written findings of fact and conclusions of law.",
              "(g) Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (a) of this section, the commissioner may deny an application for registration as a broker-dealer, agent, investment adviser, investment adviser agent or branch office if the applicant fails to respond to any request for information required under sections 36b-2 to 36b-34 , inclusive, or the regulations adopted pursuant to said sections. The commissioner shall notify the applicant in writing that if such information is not submitted within sixty days the application shall be deemed abandoned and denied. An application filing fee paid prior to the date an application is denied pursuant to this subsection shall not be refunded. Denial of an application pursuant to this subsection shall not preclude the applicant from submitting a new application for registration under said sections. The hearing requirement provided for in subsection (f) of this section shall not apply to the denial of an application issued pursuant to this subsection."

but the commissioner may not (I) institute a revocation or suspension proceeding under this subparagraph more than five years from the date of the sanction relied on, and (II) enter an order under this subparagraph on the basis of an order under any other state act unless that order was based on facts which would constitute a ground for an order under this section; (G) may be denied registration under federal law as a broker-dealer, agent, investment adviser, investment adviser agent or as a person required to be registered under the Commodity Exchange Act, 7 USC 1 et seq., as from time to time amended, and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, or the substantial equivalent of those terms as defined in sections 36b-2 to 36b-34 , inclusive;

(I) is insolvent, either in the sense that the liabilities of such applicant, registrant or person exceed the assets of such applicant, registrant or person, or in the sense that such applicant, registrant or person cannot meet the obligations of such applicant, registrant or person as they mature; but the commissioner may not enter an order against a broker-dealer or investment adviser under this subparagraph without a finding of insolvency as to the broker-dealer or investment adviser; (J) is not qualified on the basis of such factors as training, experience, and knowledge of the securities business, except as otherwise provided in subsection (b) of this section; (K) has failed reasonably to supervise: (i) The agents or investment adviser agents of such applicant or registrant, if the applicant or registrant is a broker-dealer or investment adviser; or (ii) the agents of a broker-dealer or investment adviser agents of an investment adviser, if such applicant, registrant or other person is or was an agent, investment adviser agent or other person charged with exercising supervisory authority on behalf of a broker-dealer or investment adviser;

(M) has wilfully aided, abetted, counseled, commanded, induced or procured a violation of any provision of sections 36b-2 to 36b-34 , inclusive, or a predecessor statute or any regulation or order under such sections or a predecessor statute;

or (iii) to have been suspended or expelled from membership by or participation in a securities exchange or securities association operating under the securities laws of a foreign jurisdiction. As used in this subparagraph, “foreign” means a jurisdiction outside of the United States; or (O) has failed to pay the proper filing fee; but the commissioner may enter only a denial order under this subparagraph, and the commissioner shall vacate any such order when the deficiency has been corrected. The commissioner may not institute a suspension or revocation proceeding on the basis of a fact or transaction known to the commissioner when the registration became effective unless the proceeding is instituted within one hundred eighty days of the effective date of such registration.\n\n(b) The following provisions govern the application of subparagraph (J) of subdivision (2) of subsection (a) of this section: (1) The commissioner may not enter an order against a broker-dealer on the basis of the lack of qualification of any person other than (A) the broker-dealer if the broker-dealer is an individual, or (B) an agent of the broker-dealer; (2) the commissioner may not enter an order against an investment adviser on the basis of the lack of qualification of any person other than (A) the investment adviser if the investment adviser is an individual, or (B) any other person who represents the investment adviser in doing any of the acts which make the investment adviser an investment adviser; (3) the commissioner may not enter an order solely on the basis of lack of experience if the applicant or registrant is qualified by training or knowledge or both; (4) the commissioner shall consider that an agent who will work under the supervision of a registered broker-dealer need not have the same qualifications as a broker-dealer; (5) the commissioner shall consider that an investment adviser is not necessarily qualified solely on the basis of experience as a broker-dealer or agent. When the commissioner finds that an applicant for initial or renewal registration as a broker-dealer is not qualified as an investment adviser, the commissioner may by order condition the applicant's registration as a broker-dealer upon the applicant's not transacting business in this state as an investment adviser; (6) the commissioner may by regulation provide for an examination, which may be written or oral or both, to be taken by any class of or all applicants, as well as persons who represent or will represent an investment adviser in doing any of the acts which make the investment adviser an investment adviser.\n\n(c) The commissioner may by order summarily postpone or suspend registration or require a registrant to take or refrain from taking such action that in the opinion of the commissioner will effectuate the purposes of sections 36b-2 to 36b-34 , inclusive, pending final determination of any proceeding under this section. Upon the entry of the order, the commissioner shall promptly notify the applicant or registrant, as well as the employer or prospective employer if the applicant or registrant is an agent or an investment adviser agent, that it has been entered and of the reasons therefor and that within fifteen days after the receipt of a written request the matter will be set down for hearing. If no hearing is requested and none is ordered by the commissioner, the order will remain in effect until it is modified or vacated by the commissioner. If a hearing is requested or ordered, the commissioner, after notice of and opportunity for hearing, may modify or vacate the order or extend it until final determination.\n\n(d) If the commissioner finds that any registrant or applicant for registration is no longer in existence or has ceased to do business as a broker-dealer, agent, investment adviser or investment adviser agent, or is subject to an adjudication of mental incompetence or to the control of a committee, conservator, or guardian, or cannot be located after reasonable search, the commissioner may by order cancel the registration or application.\n\n(e) (1) Withdrawal from registration as a broker-dealer, agent, investment adviser or investment adviser agent, or withdrawal of an application for registration as a broker-dealer, agent, investment adviser or investment adviser agent, becomes effective ninety days after receipt of an application to withdraw such registration or a notice of intent to withdraw such application for registration or within such shorter period of time as the commissioner may determine, unless a denial, revocation or suspension proceeding is pending when the application or notice is filed or a proceeding to deny, revoke, suspend or impose conditions upon the withdrawal is instituted within ninety days after the application or notice is filed. If a proceeding is pending or instituted, withdrawal becomes effective at such time and upon such conditions as the commissioner by order determines. If no proceeding is pending or instituted and withdrawal automatically becomes effective, the commissioner may nevertheless institute a denial, revocation or suspension proceeding under subsection (a) of this section within one year after withdrawal became effective.\n\n(2) If the registration of a broker-dealer, agent, investment adviser or investment adviser agent expires due to the registrant's failure to renew, within one year of such expiration, the commissioner may nevertheless institute a revocation or suspension proceeding or issue an order suspending or revoking the registration under subsection (a) of this section.\n\n(f) No order may be entered under this section except as provided in subsection (c) of this section without (1) appropriate prior notice to the applicant or registrant and to the employer or prospective employer if such applicant or registrant is an agent or investment adviser agent, (2) opportunity for hearing, and (3) written findings of fact and conclusions of law.\n\n(g) Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (a) of this section, the commissioner may deny an application for registration as a broker-dealer, agent, investment adviser, investment adviser agent or branch office if the applicant fails to respond to any request for information required under sections 36b-2 to 36b-34 , inclusive, or the regulations adopted pursuant to said sections. The commissioner shall notify the applicant in writing that if such information is not submitted within sixty days the application shall be deemed abandoned and denied. An application filing fee paid prior to the date an application is denied pursuant to this subsection shall not be refunded. Denial of an application pursuant to this subsection shall not preclude the applicant from submitting a new application for registration under said sections. The hearing requirement provided for in subsection (f) of this section shall not apply to the denial of an application issued pursuant to this subsection."

For purposes of this subsection, a delay in the payment of a fee or underpayment of a fee that is promptly remedied shall not constitute a refusal to pay such fee. No such order may be entered without appropriate prior notice to all interested parties, opportunity for hearing and written findings of fact and conclusions of law, except that the commissioner may by order summarily deny or revoke any of the specified exemptions or summarily suspend the offer or sale of any covered security subject to any of the requirements set forth in subsections (c), (d) or (e) of this section pending final determination of any proceeding under this subsection. Upon the entry of a summary order, the commissioner shall promptly notify all interested parties that it has been entered and of the reasons therefor and that within fifteen days of the receipt of a written request the matter will be set down for hearing. If no hearing is requested and none is ordered by the commissioner, the order will remain in effect until it is modified or vacated by the commissioner. If a hearing is requested or ordered, the commissioner after notice of, and opportunity for, hearing to all interested persons may modify or vacate the order or extend it until final determination. No order under this subsection may operate retroactively. No person may be considered to have violated sections 36b-16 and 36b-22 by reason of any offer or sale effected after the entry of an order under this subsection if such person sustains the burden of proof that such person did not know, and in the exercise of reasonable care could not have known, of the order.",
              "(g) In any proceeding under sections 36b-2 to 36b-34 , inclusive, the burden of proving an exemption, preemption, exclusion or an exception from a definition is upon the person claiming it."

Such notice may be renewed annually thereafter upon submission of such information as the commissioner may require together with a nonrefundable fee of five hundred dollars; and (4) any notice filed pursuant to this subsection relating to a security issued by a closed-end company shall be valid for one year from the date of receipt by the commissioner or from the date that such security is declared effective by the Securities and Exchange Commission, whichever is later, and shall be accompanied by the nonrefundable fee prescribed in section 36b-19 . A closed-end company, the securities of which will continue to be offered or distributed beyond the anniversary date of the filing of such notice with the commissioner or the declaration of such security's effectiveness by the Securities and Exchange Commission, whichever is later, shall file such information as the commissioner may require and include the fee prescribed in section 36b-19 .\n\n(d) Any person who offers or sells a security that is a covered security under Section 18(b)(3) of the Securities Act of 1933 shall file a consent to service of process with the commissioner as required by subsection (g) of section 36b-33 prior to the first offer or sale of such security in this state.\n\n(e) Any person who offers or sells a security that is a covered security under Section 18(b)(4)(E) of the Securities Act of 1933 shall file a notice with the commissioner within fifteen days after the first sale of such a security in this state. Such notice shall contain such information as the commissioner may require and shall be accompanied by a consent to service of process as required by subsection (g) of section 36b-33 and a nonrefundable fee of one hundred fifty dollars.\n\n(f) The commissioner may by order (1) deny or revoke any exemption specified in subdivision (9) or (11) of subsection (a) of this section or in subsection (b) of this section with respect to a specific security or transaction, (2) suspend the offer or sale of a covered security in this state if any person who offers a covered security fails to comply with any of the requirements set forth in subsections (c), (d) or (e) of this section, or (3) require any person who offers a covered security in this state and refuses to pay any fee required by subsections (c) or (e) of this section to register such security pursuant to section 36b-16 . For purposes of this subsection, a delay in the payment of a fee or underpayment of a fee that is promptly remedied shall not constitute a refusal to pay such fee. No such order may be entered without appropriate prior notice to all interested parties, opportunity for hearing and written findings of fact and conclusions of law, except that the commissioner may by order summarily deny or revoke any of the specified exemptions or summarily suspend the offer or sale of any covered security subject to any of the requirements set forth in subsections (c), (d) or (e) of this section pending final determination of any proceeding under this subsection. Upon the entry of a summary order, the commissioner shall promptly notify all interested parties that it has been entered and of the reasons therefor and that within fifteen days of the receipt of a written request the matter will be set down for hearing. If no hearing is requested and none is ordered by the commissioner, the order will remain in effect until it is modified or vacated by the commissioner. If a hearing is requested or ordered, the commissioner after notice of, and opportunity for, hearing to all interested persons may modify or vacate the order or extend it until final determination. No order under this subsection may operate retroactively. No person may be considered to have violated sections 36b-16 and 36b-22 by reason of any offer or sale effected after the entry of an order under this subsection if such person sustains the burden of proof that such person did not know, and in the exercise of reasonable care could not have known, of the order.\n\n(g) In any proceeding under sections 36b-2 to 36b-34 , inclusive, the burden of proving an exemption, preemption, exclusion or an exception from a definition is upon the person claiming it."

The commissioner shall send a copy of any order issued pursuant to this subsection by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, or by any express delivery carrier that provides a dated delivery receipt, to any person named in such order.\n\n(e) Whenever it appears to the commissioner that any person has violated, is violating or is about to violate any of the provisions of sections 36b-2 to 36b-34 , inclusive, or any regulation, rule or order adopted or issued under said sections, or that the further sale or offer to sell securities would constitute a violation of said sections or any such regulation, rule or order, the commissioner may, in the commissioner's discretion and in addition to any other remedy authorized by this section, bring an action in the superior court for the judicial district of Hartford to: (1) Enjoin the acts or practices and to enforce compliance with sections 36b-2 to 36b-34 , inclusive, or any such regulation, rule or order against (A) such person; (B) any other person who directly or indirectly controls such person and who is, was or would be a cause of the violation of said sections 36b-2 to 36b-34 , inclusive, or any such regulation, rule or order due to an act or omission such other person knew or should have known would contribute to such violation; or (C) any other person who has materially aided, is materially aiding or is about to materially aid in such violation. Upon a proper showing, the court may issue a permanent or temporary injunction, restraining order or writ of mandamus and may order other appropriate or ancillary relief, which may include: (i) An asset freeze, accounting, writ of attachment, writ of general or specific execution, and appointment of a receiver or conservator, who may be the commissioner or a person recommended by the commissioner, for the defendant or the defendant's assets. If a person other than the commissioner is appointed receiver or conservator, the commissioner shall be a party to the receivership proceeding or conservatorship with standing to initiate or contest any motion, and the views of the commissioner shall be entitled to deference unless they are inconsistent with the plain meaning of sections 36b-2 to 36b-34 , inclusive. The commissioner may appoint such employees and retain such consultants as the commissioner deems necessary for liquidating or administering the affairs of the defendant; (ii) an order directing the commissioner to take charge and control of a defendant's property, including investment accounts and accounts in a depository institution, rents, and profits; to collect debts; and to acquire and dispose of property; (iii) an order directing the payment of prejudgment and postjudgment interest; or (iv) an order covering such other relief as the court considers appropriate. The court shall not require the commissioner to post a bond; (2) seek a court order imposing a fine not to exceed one hundred thousand dollars per violation against the person found to have violated, caused a violation or materially aided in the violation of any provision of sections 36b-2 to 36b-34 , inclusive, or any regulation, rule or order adopted or issued under said sections 36b-2 to 36b-34 , inclusive; (3) apply for an order whereby the person that violated any of the provisions of said sections 36b-2 to 36b-34 , inclusive, or any regulation, rule or order adopted or issued under said sections shall be ordered to: (A) Make restitution of those sums shown by the commissioner to have been obtained by such person in violation of any of the provisions of said sections or any such regulation, rule or order, plus interest at the rate set forth in section 37-3a ; (B) provide disgorgement of any sums shown to have been obtained in violation of any of the provisions of said sections or any such regulation, rule or order; (C) both make restitution and provide disgorgement; or (4) apply for an order whereby any person who directly or indirectly controls a person liable under subdivision (3) of this subsection, or who has materially aided a person liable under subdivision (3) of this subsection in a violation of any of the provisions of sections 36b-2 to 36b-34 , inclusive, or any regulation, rule or order adopted or issued under said sections, to make restitution, provide disgorgement, or both, of any sums shown to have been obtained as a result of such violation. Such controlling person or aider shall be liable jointly and severally with and to the same extent as the person liable under subdivision (3) of this subsection, unless such controlling person or aider allegedly liable under this subdivision sustains the burden of proof that such person did not know, and in the exercise of reasonable care could not have known, of the existence of facts by reason of which the liability is alleged to exist. Such restitution or disgorgement shall, at the option of the court, be payable to the receiver or conservator appointed pursuant to this subsection, or directly to the persons whose assets were obtained in violation of any provision of sections 36b-2 to 36b-34 , inclusive, or any such regulation, rule or order.\n\n(f) Any time after the issuance of an order or notice provided for in subsection (a), (b) or (c) or subdivision (1) of subsection (d) of this section, the commissioner may accept an agreement by any respondent named in such order or notice to enter into a written consent order in lieu of an adjudicative hearing. The acceptance of a consent order shall be within the complete discretion of the commissioner. The consent order provided for in this subsection shall contain (1) an express waiver of the right to seek judicial review or otherwise challenge or contest the validity of the order or notice; (2) a provision that the order or notice may be used in construing the terms of the consent order; (3) a statement that the consent order shall become final when issued; (4) a specific assurance that none of the violations alleged in the order or notice shall occur in the future; (5) such other terms and conditions as are necessary to further the purposes and policies of sections 36b-2 to 36b-34 , inclusive; (6) the signature of each of the individual respondents evidencing such respondent's consent; and (7) the signature of the commissioner or of the commissioner's authorized representative."
