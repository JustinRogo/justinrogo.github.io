Such orders and rules shall permit the institution of a small claims action against a nonresident defendant who owns real or personal property in this state and against an out-of-state corporation.\n\n(c) Upon the taking effect of such orders and rules, all provisions of statute, both public and private, and the provisions of any orders or rules adopted by the judges of the Superior Court prior to July 1, 1957, inconsistent with or superseded by them, shall be deemed to be repealed, to the extent necessary to render the orders and rules effective.\n\n(d) The procedure for the hearing and determination of small claims as the same may be prescribed, from time to time, by the judges of the Superior Court shall be used in all small claims sessions of the court. The small claims procedure shall only be applicable to (1) all actions claiming money damages not in excess of five thousand dollars, except such procedure shall not be applicable to actions of libel and slander, and (2) actions claiming loss or damages not in excess of fifteen thousand dollars sustained by reason of (A) performance of, or offer to perform, home improvement, as defined in section 20-419 , by a contractor holding a certificate under chapter 400, or (B) a contract for new home construction with a new home construction contractor holding a certificate under chapter 399a. If an action is brought in the small claims session by a tenant pursuant to subsection (g) of section 47a-21 to reclaim any part of a security deposit which may be due, the judicial authority hearing the action may award to the tenant the damages authorized by subsection (d) of said section and, if authorized by the rental agreement or any provision of the general statutes, costs, notwithstanding that the amount of such damages and costs, in the aggregate, exceeds the jurisdictional monetary limit established by subdivision (1) of this subsection. If a motion is filed to transfer a small claims matter to the regular docket in the court, the moving party shall pay the fee prescribed by section 52-259 . The Attorney General or an assistant attorney general, or the head of any state agency or his or her authorized representative, while acting in his or her official capacity shall not be required to pay any small claims court fee. There shall be no charge for copies of service on defendants in small claims matters.\n\nSee chapter 922a re hearing of small claims matters.\n\nSee Sec. 52-259 re court fees for entry and transfer of small claims cases."

The commission shall adopt regulations in accordance with the provisions of chapter 54 concerning criteria by which to evaluate incumbent judges who seek reappointment to the same court; provided pending adoption of such regulations, the commission shall use criteria established prior to June 22, 1989, for the evaluation of such judges. In evaluating the reappointment of an incumbent judge, the commission shall consider the legal ability, competence, integrity, character and temperament of such judge and any other relevant information concerning such judge. There shall be a presumption that each incumbent judge who seeks reappointment to the same court qualifies for retention in judicial office. The burden of rebutting such presumption shall be on the commission. The commission shall investigate and interview each incumbent judge who seeks reappointment and, prior to the expiration of a term of office of such judge, shall recommend such incumbent judge for nomination for reappointment by the Governor to the same court unless, as provided in this subsection, recommendation of such judge is denied. If a preliminary examination indicates further inquiry is necessary before a recommendation of reappointment may be made, the commission shall hold a hearing concerning the reappointment of such judge. The commission shall send notice to the judge by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested, not less than one hundred eighty days prior to the convening of such legislative session which is to consider the reappointment of the incumbent judge, (A) that a hearing by the commission on such reappointment shall be held and of the time, date and place of such hearing, which shall be not less than thirty days nor more than forty-five days after the date of such notice and (B) of specific claims made against the judge. The commission shall make a record of all hearings conducted pursuant to this subsection. The hearing may be open to the public at the request of the judge. For purposes of conducting a hearing under this subsection, not less than ten members of the commission shall be present and voting. A judge appearing before such a hearing shall be entitled to counsel, to present evidence and to cross-examine witnesses who appear voluntarily. No judge shall be required to sign or execute any release in order to proceed with the hearing. The commission shall not later than twenty days after the close of such hearing render its decision whether it shall recommend such incumbent judge for nomination for reappointment by the Governor. Any affirmative vote of a majority plus one of the members present and voting shall be required to deny recommendation to the Governor for nomination of an incumbent judge to the same court. A judge who has not received approval by the commission may within ten days after receipt of the notice of decision, which shall include a record of the numerical vote, request a rehearing on the grounds that the conclusions of the commission are contrary to the evidence presented at the hearing or the commission failed to comply with the procedural or substantive requirements of this section. The decision of the commission shall be final. There shall be no right of appeal by any judge appearing before the commission, at law or in equity, or any resort to any court following the decision of the commission.",

The commission shall adopt regulations, in accordance with the provisions of chapter 54, concerning criteria by which to evaluate the qualifications of candidates, including incumbent judges who seek appointment to a different court. The commission shall investigate and interview the candidates, including incumbent judges seeking appointment to a different court. A list of such qualified candidates shall be compiled by the commission.",

The commission may, upon request of the judge whose reappointment is at issue, issue a subpoena on behalf of such judge. If any person disobeys such process or, having appeared in obedience thereto refuses to answer any pertinent question put to him by the commission, or to produce any books and papers pursuant thereto, the commission, on its own behalf or on behalf of the judge, may apply to the superior court for the judicial district of Hartford setting forth such disobedience to process or refusal to answer, and said court may cite such person to appear before said court to answer such question or to produce such books and papers and, upon his refusal so to do shall commit him to a community correctional center, there to remain until he so testifies.",
              "(h) (1) Judges of all courts, except those courts to which judges are elected, shall be nominated by the Governor exclusively from the list of candidates or incumbent judges submitted by the Judicial Selection Commission. Any candidate or incumbent judge who is nominated from such list by the Governor to be Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, and who is appointed Chief Justice by the General Assembly, shall serve a term of eight years from the date of appointment. The Governor shall nominate a candidate for a vacancy in a judicial position within forty-five days of the date the Governor receives the recommendations of the commission. When considering the nomination of an incumbent judge for reappointment to the same court, the Governor may nominate the incumbent judge if the commission did not deny recommendation for reappointment. Whenever an incumbent judge is denied recommendation for reappointment to the same court by the commission or is recommended by the commission but not nominated by the Governor for reappointment to the same court, or whenever a vacancy in a judicial position occurs or is anticipated, the Governor shall choose a nominee from the list of candidates compiled pursuant to subsection (f) of this section. (2) Notwithstanding the provisions of subdivision (1) of this subsection and subsection (f) of this section, the Governor may nominate an associate judge of the Supreme Court to be Chief Justice of the Supreme Court without such judge being investigated and interviewed by the commission and being on the list of qualified candidates compiled and submitted to the Governor by the commission. An associate judge of the Supreme Court who has been nominated by the Governor to be Chief Justice of the Supreme Court in accordance with this subdivision, and who is appointed Chief Justice by the General Assembly, shall serve an initial term as Chief Justice equal to the remainder of such judge's term as an associate judge of the Supreme Court.",
              "(i) A majority of the membership of the commission shall constitute a quorum. The affirmative vote of at least a majority of the members of the commission present and voting shall be required for any action by the commission except (1) an affirmative vote of at least a majority plus one of the members present and voting shall be required for a new nominee to be recommended to the Governor for nomination as a judge or for an incumbent judge to be recommended to the Governor for nomination as a judge to a different court and (2) an affirmative vote of a majority plus one of the members present and voting shall be required to deny recommendation to the Governor for nomination of an incumbent judge to the same court. No vote of the commission on a new nominee shall be by secret ballot. The vote of the commission on an incumbent judge may be by secret ballot.",
              "(j) Except as provided in subsections (e) and (m) of this section, the investigations, deliberations, files and records of the commission shall be confidential and not open to the public or subject to disclosure except that the criteria by which candidates or incumbent judges who seek reappointment to the same court or appointment to a different court are evaluated and the procedural rules adopted by the commission shall be public.",
              "(k) The commission may employ such staff as is necessary for the performance of its functions and duties.",
              "(l) No member of the commission who is an attorney-at-law shall be considered for recommendation to the Governor for nomination as a judge during his tenure on the commission or for a period of two years following the termination of his tenure on the commission.",
              "(m) On January 15, 2011, and annually thereafter, the chairperson of the commission shall report to the joint standing committee on judiciary the following information with respect to the prior calendar year: (1) The number of candidates interviewed for appointment as new nominees, the number of incumbent judges interviewed for reappointment to the same court and the number of incumbent judges interviewed for appointment to a different court, (2) the number of candidates who were recommended and denied recommendation to the Governor as new nominees, the number of incumbent judges recommended and denied recommendation for appointment to the same court and the number of incumbent judges recommended and denied recommendation for appointment to a different court, (3) the statistics regarding the race, gender, national origin, religion and years of experience as members of the bar of all such candidates and incumbent judges interviewed, recommended and denied recommendation under subdivisions (1) and (2) of this subsection, and (4) as of January first in the year of such report, the number of candidates on the list compiled by the commission pursuant to subsection (f) of this section and the statistics regarding the race, gender, national origin, religion, years of experience as members of the bar and calendar year of recommendation of all such candidates.",
              "(n) The commission shall have the power to enter into such contractual agreements as may be necessary for the discharge of its duties concerning the investigation of candidates seeking appointment to a judicial position and incumbent judges seeking reappointment to the same court or appointment to a different court, within the limits of appropriated funds and in accordance with established procedures."

None of the members shall be an elected or appointed official of the state or hold state-wide office in a political party.\n\n(b) The members of the commission shall be appointed as follows: The Governor shall appoint six members, one from each congressional district and one at-large member, three of whom shall be attorneys-at-law and three of whom shall not be attorneys-at-law; the president pro tempore of the Senate shall appoint one member who shall be an attorney-at-law; the speaker of the House of Representatives shall appoint one member who shall not be an attorney-at-law; the majority leader of the Senate shall appoint one member who shall not be an attorney-at-law; the majority leader of the House of Representatives shall appoint one member who shall be an attorney-at-law; the minority leader of the Senate shall appoint one member who shall not be an attorney-at-law; and the minority leader of the House of Representatives shall appoint one member who shall be an attorney-at-law.\n\n(c) The members of the commission shall elect a chairperson from among the members appointed by the Governor.\n\n(d) (1) The members of the commission shall serve for terms of three years.\n\n(2) Members appointed on or after June 26, 2003, shall serve for terms of three years and, notwithstanding the provisions of section 4-1 , until their successors are appointed and have qualified or ninety days after the completion of their terms, whichever is earlier.\n\n(3) Members serving on June 26, 2003, shall continue to serve as members until the end of their terms and, notwithstanding the provisions of section 4-1 , until their successors are appointed and have qualified or ninety days after the completion of their terms, whichever is earlier, except that members serving on June 26, 2003, who have completed their terms and are serving until their successors are appointed and have qualified shall, notwithstanding the provisions of section 4-1 , continue to serve until their successors are appointed and have qualified, but not later than January 1, 2004.\n\n(4) Any vacancy in the membership of the commission shall be filled for the unexpired portion of the term by the appointing authority. The members of the commission shall receive no compensation for their services but shall be reimbursed for any necessary expenses incurred in the performance of their duties.\n\n(5) No member of the commission may serve consecutive terms, except that if, on or after June 26, 2003, a person is appointed a member of the commission to fill a vacancy and complete an unexpired term, such person may serve an additional term. If a commission member is an attorney, no member of the commission member's firm may serve a term consecutive to such commission member.\n\n(e) The commission shall evaluate incumbent judges who seek reappointment to the same court and shall forward to the Governor for consideration the names of incumbent judges who are recommended for reappointment as provided in this subsection. The commission shall adopt regulations in accordance with the provisions of chapter 54 concerning criteria by which to evaluate incumbent judges who seek reappointment to the same court; provided pending adoption of such regulations, the commission shall use criteria established prior to June 22, 1989, for the evaluation of such judges. In evaluating the reappointment of an incumbent judge, the commission shall consider the legal ability, competence, integrity, character and temperament of such judge and any other relevant information concerning such judge. There shall be a presumption that each incumbent judge who seeks reappointment to the same court qualifies for retention in judicial office. The burden of rebutting such presumption shall be on the commission. The commission shall investigate and interview each incumbent judge who seeks reappointment and, prior to the expiration of a term of office of such judge, shall recommend such incumbent judge for nomination for reappointment by the Governor to the same court unless, as provided in this subsection, recommendation of such judge is denied. If a preliminary examination indicates further inquiry is necessary before a recommendation of reappointment may be made, the commission shall hold a hearing concerning the reappointment of such judge. The commission shall send notice to the judge by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested, not less than one hundred eighty days prior to the convening of such legislative session which is to consider the reappointment of the incumbent judge, (A) that a hearing by the commission on such reappointment shall be held and of the time, date and place of such hearing, which shall be not less than thirty days nor more than forty-five days after the date of such notice and (B) of specific claims made against the judge. The commission shall make a record of all hearings conducted pursuant to this subsection. The hearing may be open to the public at the request of the judge. For purposes of conducting a hearing under this subsection, not less than ten members of the commission shall be present and voting. A judge appearing before such a hearing shall be entitled to counsel, to present evidence and to cross-examine witnesses who appear voluntarily. No judge shall be required to sign or execute any release in order to proceed with the hearing. The commission shall not later than twenty days after the close of such hearing render its decision whether it shall recommend such incumbent judge for nomination for reappointment by the Governor. Any affirmative vote of a majority plus one of the members present and voting shall be required to deny recommendation to the Governor for nomination of an incumbent judge to the same court. A judge who has not received approval by the commission may within ten days after receipt of the notice of decision, which shall include a record of the numerical vote, request a rehearing on the grounds that the conclusions of the commission are contrary to the evidence presented at the hearing or the commission failed to comply with the procedural or substantive requirements of this section. The decision of the commission shall be final. There shall be no right of appeal by any judge appearing before the commission, at law or in equity, or any resort to any court following the decision of the commission.\n\n(f) Except as provided in subsection (e) of this section, the commission shall seek qualified candidates for consideration by the Governor for nomination as judges for the Superior Court, Appellate Court and Supreme Court. The commission shall adopt regulations, in accordance with the provisions of chapter 54, concerning criteria by which to evaluate the qualifications of candidates, including incumbent judges who seek appointment to a different court. The commission shall investigate and interview the candidates, including incumbent judges seeking appointment to a different court. A list of such qualified candidates shall be compiled by the commission.\n\n(g) In connection with any inquiry concerning the reappointment of an incumbent judge, the commission shall have the power to issue subpoenas requiring the attendance of witnesses and the production of any books or papers which in the judgment of the commission are relevant to the inquiry. The commission may, upon request of the judge whose reappointment is at issue, issue a subpoena on behalf of such judge. If any person disobeys such process or, having appeared in obedience thereto refuses to answer any pertinent question put to him by the commission, or to produce any books and papers pursuant thereto, the commission, on its own behalf or on behalf of the judge, may apply to the superior court for the judicial district of Hartford setting forth such disobedience to process or refusal to answer, and said court may cite such person to appear before said court to answer such question or to produce such books and papers and, upon his refusal so to do shall commit him to a community correctional center, there to remain until he so testifies.\n\n(h) (1) Judges of all courts, except those courts to which judges are elected, shall be nominated by the Governor exclusively from the list of candidates or incumbent judges submitted by the Judicial Selection Commission. Any candidate or incumbent judge who is nominated from such list by the Governor to be Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, and who is appointed Chief Justice by the General Assembly, shall serve a term of eight years from the date of appointment. The Governor shall nominate a candidate for a vacancy in a judicial position within forty-five days of the date the Governor receives the recommendations of the commission. When considering the nomination of an incumbent judge for reappointment to the same court, the Governor may nominate the incumbent judge if the commission did not deny recommendation for reappointment. Whenever an incumbent judge is denied recommendation for reappointment to the same court by the commission or is recommended by the commission but not nominated by the Governor for reappointment to the same court, or whenever a vacancy in a judicial position occurs or is anticipated, the Governor shall choose a nominee from the list of candidates compiled pursuant to subsection (f) of this section. (2) Notwithstanding the provisions of subdivision (1) of this subsection and subsection (f) of this section, the Governor may nominate an associate judge of the Supreme Court to be Chief Justice of the Supreme Court without such judge being investigated and interviewed by the commission and being on the list of qualified candidates compiled and submitted to the Governor by the commission. An associate judge of the Supreme Court who has been nominated by the Governor to be Chief Justice of the Supreme Court in accordance with this subdivision, and who is appointed Chief Justice by the General Assembly, shall serve an initial term as Chief Justice equal to the remainder of such judge's term as an associate judge of the Supreme Court.\n\n(i) A majority of the membership of the commission shall constitute a quorum. The affirmative vote of at least a majority of the members of the commission present and voting shall be required for any action by the commission except (1) an affirmative vote of at least a majority plus one of the members present and voting shall be required for a new nominee to be recommended to the Governor for nomination as a judge or for an incumbent judge to be recommended to the Governor for nomination as a judge to a different court and (2) an affirmative vote of a majority plus one of the members present and voting shall be required to deny recommendation to the Governor for nomination of an incumbent judge to the same court. No vote of the commission on a new nominee shall be by secret ballot. The vote of the commission on an incumbent judge may be by secret ballot.\n\n(j) Except as provided in subsections (e) and (m) of this section, the investigations, deliberations, files and records of the commission shall be confidential and not open to the public or subject to disclosure except that the criteria by which candidates or incumbent judges who seek reappointment to the same court or appointment to a different court are evaluated and the procedural rules adopted by the commission shall be public.\n\n(k) The commission may employ such staff as is necessary for the performance of its functions and duties.\n\n(l) No member of the commission who is an attorney-at-law shall be considered for recommendation to the Governor for nomination as a judge during his tenure on the commission or for a period of two years following the termination of his tenure on the commission.\n\n(m) On January 15, 2011, and annually thereafter, the chairperson of the commission shall report to the joint standing committee on judiciary the following information with respect to the prior calendar year: (1) The number of candidates interviewed for appointment as new nominees, the number of incumbent judges interviewed for reappointment to the same court and the number of incumbent judges interviewed for appointment to a different court, (2) the number of candidates who were recommended and denied recommendation to the Governor as new nominees, the number of incumbent judges recommended and denied recommendation for appointment to the same court and the number of incumbent judges recommended and denied recommendation for appointment to a different court, (3) the statistics regarding the race, gender, national origin, religion and years of experience as members of the bar of all such candidates and incumbent judges interviewed, recommended and denied recommendation under subdivisions (1) and (2) of this subsection, and (4) as of January first in the year of such report, the number of candidates on the list compiled by the commission pursuant to subsection (f) of this section and the statistics regarding the race, gender, national origin, religion, years of experience as members of the bar and calendar year of recommendation of all such candidates.\n\n(n) The commission shall have the power to enter into such contractual agreements as may be necessary for the discharge of its duties concerning the investigation of candidates seeking appointment to a judicial position and incumbent judges seeking reappointment to the same court or appointment to a different court, within the limits of appropriated funds and in accordance with established procedures."

Each lawyer and law firm having a clients' funds account shall participate in the program. On and after July 1, 2005, each entity, other than a borrower, having an account established to receive loan proceeds from a mortgage lender, as defined in this subsection, shall participate in the program. Under the program, funds in accounts established to receive such loan proceeds, regardless of the amount or period held, and a client's funds that the client's lawyers and law firms determine, in good faith, cannot earn income for the client in excess of the costs incurred to secure such income, shall be deposited by participating lawyers, law firms and entities in interest-bearing accounts specifically established pursuant to the program. Funds deposited in such accounts shall be subject to withdrawal upon request by the depositor and without delay. The interest earned on such accounts shall be paid to an organization qualified under Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, or any subsequent corresponding internal revenue code of the United States, as from time to time amended, which shall be designated to administer the program by the judges of the Superior Court pursuant to subsection (d) of this section. Nothing in this section shall prevent (A) a lawyer or law firm from depositing a client's funds, regardless of the amount of such funds or the period for which such funds are expected to be held, in a separate interest-bearing account established on behalf of and for the benefit of the client, or (B) an entity from depositing a person's loan proceeds, regardless of the amount of such proceeds or the period for which such proceeds are expected to be held, in a separate interest-bearing account established on behalf of and for the benefit of the person. The organization administering the program shall mail to each lawyer, law firm and entity participating in the program a detailed annual report of all funds disbursed under the program including the amount disbursed to each recipient of funds. Any recipient of funds under the program which, using program funds, represents a party in an action filed after July 1, 1992, against the state or any officer or agency thereof and is awarded attorney's fees in such action by the court, shall reimburse the program for the amount of attorney's fees received in proportion to the percentage of program funds used for the litigation. No recipient of funds under the program may use such funds to pay the occupational tax imposed pursuant to section 51-81b on behalf of any attorney. As used in this section, “mortgage lender” means any person engaged in the business of making mortgage loans, including, but not limited to, a bank, out-of-state bank, Connecticut credit union, federal credit union, out-of-state credit union, mortgage lender or mortgage correspondent lender required to be licensed under sections 36a-485 to 36a-498a , inclusive.",

              "(e) The program shall not require the banking corporations or financial institutions receiving such funds, holding such accounts and paying interest on such accounts to the depositors of the account to perform any additional administrative functions or assume any additional responsibilities or obligations in connection with the program or the accounts so maintained.",
              "(f) An advisory panel shall be established to perform the functions described in subsection (g) of this section consisting of five members to be selected as follows: Three members shall be appointed by the Governor, one of whom shall be an executive director of a nonprofit corporation which provides legal services to the poor in this state; and two members shall be appointed by the cochairpersons of the joint standing committee of the General Assembly having cognizance of matters relating to the judiciary.

Any person found guilty at the trial or upon a plea shall be guilty of the commission of a violation and shall be fined not more than the statutory amount applicable to such violation."

Trial court's finding that plaintiff had waived the provisions of section by executing multiple agreements extending the period of time for the court to render judgment was clearly erroneous and voidable when the court ultimately rendered judgment after the date stipulated in the parties' second extension. 144 CA 62. When an extension is unaccompanied by any language of limitation or conditions, it necessarily operates as a waiver, and because defendants consented to an extension of the 120-day time period within which the court was required to issue its decision, and did not set forth any conditions or limitations on the agreed upon extension, the court's determination that they waived the 120-day rule was not clearly erroneous. 163 CA 1."

In sentencing under uniform state narcotic drug act, court must follow rigorous penalty provisions set forth therein. Id., 388, 392. Proof of variation from sentences given in comparable cases does not necessarily mean that sentence in issue is improper. Id., 388, 434. Enumeration of factors to be considered in setting a sentence. Id., 384, 412. Division cannot evaluate other cases where it is claimed that lesser sentences were imposed unless it has before it the facts of such cases. Id., 415. In determining a proper sentence, trial court owes duty to public as much as it does to accused. Id., 418. Maximum sentences given to defendants who were first offenders under uniform state narcotic drug act reduced from 10 to 7 years as both had used drugs for a short time only and neither sold narcotics. Id., 421. It is function of board of parole, not sentence review division, to determine when a person should be released from prison. Id., 423. Sentence of narcotics offender reduced where background showed prior voluntary submission to arrest in an effort to break narcotic habit. Id., 426. Defendant sentenced to reformatory and then to prison, terms to be served consecutively; prison sentence suspended for presumably he would be reformed while serving reformatory sentence. Id., 431. Relatively more severe sentences may be justified in crimes involving injury or risk of injury to children. Id., 434. Purpose of division is to achieve more rational sentences and greater equality of treatment for offenders; considerations of clemency and postprison reform are matters outside its scope. Id., 448. In sentencing, deterrence of such conduct on the part of others is a desired goal since public has right to be protected against crimes threatening high social and personal injury. Id., 452. Defendant received a higher penalty than his codefendant though tried on a lesser charge, sentence held proper. Id., 455. Defendant charged as second offender; fact that all who might have been presented as second offenders have not been so presented cannot aid defendant. Id., 457. Defendant convicted of manslaughter; in view of circumstances of the killing, defendant's inclination to violence as shown by his criminal record and his knowledge, when he pleaded guilty, of what sentence would be recommended, his sentence held proper. Id., 461. Under uniform state narcotic drug act, conviction of defendant as second offender made compulsory minimum imprisonment term of 10 years, once court deemed confinement was required, and defendant's claim that this amounts to a life sentence because of his age is a request based on considerations of clemency and more properly addressed to the board of pardons. Id., 463. Court's objective to impose a maximum sentence which would ensure that defendant would be under jurisdiction of parole board for the rest of his life could be accomplished with a lesser sentence, so sentence modified accordingly. Id., 468. Mere fact that defendant received a higher sentence than his codefendant affords no sound basis of comparison without the consideration of other pertinent surrounding circumstances. Id., 468, 474. The stress is not alone upon the criminal act but upon make-up of the offender and chances of his reform. Id., 474. Because the trial judge has opportunity to weigh and consider factors personal to defendant in connection with evidence, his opinion as to appropriateness of a sentence deserves great weight. Id., 477. Sentence increased where defendant was second offender and his sentence was less than that given for first offense. Id., 480. Matters which are administrative in nature are not reviewable by review division. 22 CS 208. Trial court's refusal to appoint new counsel in place of public defender was not matter with which review division could concern itself; function limited to harshness of sentence. 25 CS 3. Sentence of 3 to 7 years for blackmail found proper in view of heinous nature of crime and defendant's poor juvenile record. Id., 5. Division not empowered to comply with request of person convicted of violating narcotics act to send him to Kentucky hospital. Id., 7. Defendant's war record, being recited in presentence report, was before court at time of sentencing and cannot now be used to mitigate sentence. Id., 55. All factors must be weighed in reviewing sentences, not just those favorable to defendant. Id., 57. Sentence increased where robberies were vicious and no consideration for victims was shown. Id., 68. Sentence reduction denied where defendant had some knowledge of what is proper in law and order and chose to assume control on his own. Id., 73. Division not empowered to transfer prisoner from jail to a place where he could receive psychiatric help. Id., 145. Cited. Id., 149; Id., 473, 474, 484; 26 CS 176. Where defendant sentenced as second offender asked review division to reduce his maximum term on ground that parole board had denied him parole, held it is not function of division thus to pass on actions of parole board. Id., 196. Where minor defendant was committed to reformatory for indefinite term for crime for which adult could be confined only 30 days, sentence too severe. Id., 506. Where maximum sentence that could have been imposed would be aggregate of 120 days except for reformatory commitment, sentence of not more than 2 years without possibility of parole for 9 months too severe. 27 CS 81. Where, if court had imposed maximum penalty on all charges, result would be substantial fine and sentence in excess of 2 years and in view of defendant's presentence behavior, commitment to reformatory for not more than 2 years with basic minimum of 9 months on good behavior fair and should stand. Id., 89. Where minor defendant committed to reformatory to be detained not more than 2 years was witness for state and helped state obtain a conviction and had been unable to post bond, being jailed over 3 months prior to conviction, sentence too severe. Id., 100. Evidence of reform after conviction outside scope of division's consideration. Id., 221. Unnecessary for division to find facts and interpret statutes to determine its jurisdiction to modify sentence to comply with law limiting commitments to reformatory to males between 16 and 21 when matter not raised before division. Id., 239. Different sentences were ordered where trial court had failed to comply with Sec. 54-121, by fixing minimum and maximum sentences on all counts of a concurrent sentence. Id., 330."

But it is error to find a material fact without evidence. 73 C. 692; 82 C. 5; 84 C. 93; 84 C. 121; 109 C. 348. Or to fail to find fact that is uncontradicted; but failure of direct evidence to contradict is not sufficient. 72 C. 225; 74 C. 468; 76 C. 323; Id., 593; 102 C. 539; 108 C. 23. If subordinate facts fail legally or logically to support ultimate fact found, court may review decision; otherwise not. 83 C. 388; Id., 628; 84 C. 70; 85 C. 225; 84 C. 632; 88 C. 163; 107 C. 420, 422; 109 C. 494.

Trial court order precluding parties from filing any further motions regarding custody or visitation constitutes an appealable final judgment. 243 C. 380. Appellate Court's judgment on transferred writ of error is tantamount to an appeal for purposes of Sec. 51-197f and Supreme Court has jurisdiction to grant certification to appeal from that judgment; even though plain language of Subsec. (c) expressly expands Appellate Court jurisdiction to include writs of error upon transfer, no language expressly divests Supreme Court of final jurisdiction over writs of error that Subsec. (a) confers. 331 C. 711."

If it appears to the court at a later date that, if convicted, the sentence of an indigent defendant for whom counsel has not been appointed will involve immediate incarceration or a suspended sentence of incarceration with a period of probation, counsel shall be appointed prior to trial or the entry of a plea of guilty or nolo contendere.\n\n(b) In the case of codefendants, the court may appoint one or more public defenders, assistant public defenders or deputy assistant public defenders to represent such defendants or may appoint counsel from the trial list established under section 51-291 .\n\n(c) (1) The division shall provide, pursuant to section 51-296a : (A) Legal services and guardians ad litem to children, youths and indigent respondents in family relations matters in which the state has been ordered to pay the cost of such legal services and guardians ad litem, provided legal services shall be provided to indigent respondents pursuant to this subparagraph only in paternity proceedings and contempt proceedings; and (B) legal services and guardians ad litem to children, youths and indigent legal parties in proceedings before the superior court for juvenile matters.
