If the board of directors fixes a different record date under subsection (e) of section 33-701 to determine the shareholders entitled to vote at the meeting, a corporation also shall prepare an alphabetical list of the names of all its shareholders who are entitled to vote at the meeting. A list shall be arranged by voting group, and within each voting group by class or series of shares, and show the address of and number of shares held by each shareholder.\n\n(b) The shareholders' list for notice shall be available for inspection by any shareholder, beginning two business days after notice of the meeting is given for which the list was prepared and continuing through the meeting, (1) at the corporation's principal office or at a place identified in the meeting notice in the city where the meeting will be held, or (2) on a reasonably accessible electronic network, provided the information required to gain access to such list is provided with the notice of the meeting. In the event that the corporation makes the list available on an electronic network, the corporation may take reasonable steps to ensure that such information is available only to shareholders of the corporation. A shareholders' list for voting must be similarly available for inspection promptly after the record date for voting. A shareholder, his agent or attorney is entitled on written demand to inspect and, subject to the requirements of subsection (d) of section 33-946 , to copy a list, during regular business hours and at his expense, during the period it is available for inspection.\n\n(c) If the meeting is to be held at a place, the corporation shall make the list of shareholders entitled to vote available during the meeting, and any shareholder, his agent or attorney is entitled to inspect the list at any time during the meeting or any adjournment. If the meeting is to be held solely by means of remote communication, such list shall be open to inspection during the meeting on a reasonably accessible electronic network, and the information required to access such list shall be provided with the notice of the meeting.\n\n(d) If the corporation refuses to allow a shareholder or his agent or attorney to inspect a shareholders' list before or at the meeting, or copy a list as permitted by subsection (b) of this section, the superior court for the judicial district where a corporation's principal office or, if none in this state, its registered office, is located, on application of the shareholder, may summarily order the inspection or copying at the corporation's expense and may postpone the meeting for which the list was prepared until the inspection or copying is complete.\n\n(e) Refusal or failure to prepare or make available a shareholders' list does not affect the validity of action taken at the meeting."

In the case of shareholders' action at a meeting, the shareholders entitled to vote shall be determined as of the record date for notice of the meeting.\n\n(b) A director who has a conflicting interest respecting the transaction shall, before the shareholders' vote, inform the secretary or other officer or agent of the corporation authorized to tabulate votes, in writing, of the number of shares that the director knows are not qualified shares under subsection (c) of this section, and the identity of the holders of those shares.\n\n(c) For purposes of this section: (1) “Holder” means, and “held by” refers to shares held by, both a record shareholder, as defined in subdivision (7) of section 33-855 , and a beneficial shareholder; and (2) “qualified shares” means all shares entitled to be voted with respect to the transaction except for shares that the secretary or other officer or agent of the corporation authorized to tabulate votes either knows, or under subsection (b) of this section is notified, are held by (A) a director who has a conflicting interest respecting the transaction, or (B) a related person of the director, excluding a person described in subparagraph (F) of subdivision (5) of section 33-781 .\n\n(d) A majority of the votes entitled to be cast by the holders of all qualified shares constitutes a quorum for purposes of compliance with this section. Subject to the provisions of subsection (e) of this section, shareholders' action that otherwise complies with this section is not affected by the presence of holders, or by the voting, of shares that are not qualified shares.\n\n(e) If a shareholders' vote does not comply with subsection (a) of this section solely because of a director's failure to comply with subsection (b) of this section, and if the director establishes that the failure was not intended to influence and did not in fact determine the outcome of the vote, the court may take such action respecting the transaction and the director, and may give such effect, if any, to the shareholders' vote, as the court considers appropriate in the circumstances.\n\n(f) Where shareholders' action under this section does not satisfy a quorum or voting requirement applicable to the authorization of the transaction by reason of the certificate of incorporation, the bylaws or a provision of law, independent action to satisfy those authorization requirements must be taken by the shareholders, in which action shares that are not qualified shares may participate."

An election pursuant to this section shall be irrevocable unless the court determines that it is equitable to set aside or modify the election.\n\n(b) An election to purchase pursuant to this section may be filed with the court at any time within ninety days after the filing of the petition under subdivision (1) of subsection (a) of section 33-896 or at such later time as the court in its discretion may allow. If the election to purchase is filed by one or more shareholders, the corporation shall, within ten days thereafter, give written notice to all shareholders, other than the petitioner. The notice must state the name and number of shares owned by the petitioner and the name and number of shares owned by each electing shareholder and must advise the recipients of their right to join in the election to purchase shares in accordance with this section. Shareholders who wish to participate must file notice of their intention to join in the purchase no later than thirty days after the effective date of the notice to them. All shareholders who have filed an election or notice of their intention to participate in the election to purchase thereby become parties to ownership of shares as of the date the first election was filed, unless they otherwise agree or the court otherwise directs. After an election has been filed by the corporation or one or more shareholders, the proceeding under subdivision (1) of subsection (a) of section 33-896 may not be discontinued or settled, nor may the petitioning shareholder sell or otherwise dispose of his shares, unless the court determines that it would be equitable to the corporation and the shareholders, other than the petitioner, to permit such discontinuance, settlement, sale or other disposition.\n\n(c) If, within sixty days of the filing of the first election, the parties reach agreement as to the fair value and terms of purchase of the petitioner's shares, the court shall enter an order directing the purchase of petitioner's shares upon the terms and conditions agreed to by the parties.\n\n(d) If the parties are unable to reach an agreement as provided for in subsection (c) of this section, the court, upon application of any party, shall stay the proceedings under subdivision (1) of subsection (a) of section 33-896 and determine the fair value of the petitioner's shares as of the day before the date on which the petition was filed or as of such other date as the court deems appropriate under the circumstances.\n\n(e) Upon determining the fair value of the shares, the court shall enter an order directing the purchase upon such terms and conditions as the court deems appropriate, which may include payment of the purchase price in installments, where necessary in the interests of equity, provision for security to assure payment of the purchase price and any additional costs, fees and expenses as may have been awarded, and, if the shares are to be purchased by shareholders, the allocation of shares among them. In allocating the petitioner's shares among holders of different classes of shares, the court should attempt to preserve the existing distribution of voting rights among holders of different classes insofar as practicable and may direct that holders of a specific class or classes shall not participate in the purchase. Interest may be allowed at the rate and from the date determined by the court to be equitable, but if the court finds that the refusal of the petitioning shareholder to accept an offer of payment was arbitrary or otherwise not in good faith, no interest shall be allowed. In a proceeding under subdivision (1) of subsection (a) of section 33-896 , if the court finds that the petitioning shareholder had probable grounds for relief under said subdivision, it may award to the petitioning shareholder reasonable fees and expenses of counsel and of any experts employed by him.\n\n(f) Upon entry of an order under subsection (c) or (e) of this section, the court shall dismiss the petition to dissolve the corporation under section 33-896 , and the petitioning shareholder shall no longer have any rights or status as a shareholder of the corporation, except the right to receive the amounts awarded to him by the order of the court which shall be enforceable in the same manner as any other judgment.\n\n(g) The purchase ordered pursuant to subsection (e) of this section shall be made within ten days after the date the order becomes final unless before that time the corporation files with the court a notice of its intention to adopt a certificate of dissolution pursuant to sections 33-881 and 33-882 , which certificate of dissolution must then be adopted and filed within fifty days thereafter. Upon filing of such certificate of dissolution, the corporation shall be dissolved in accordance with the provisions of sections 33-884 to 33-887 , inclusive, and the order entered pursuant to subsection (e) of this section shall no longer be of any force or effect, except that the court may award the petitioning shareholder reasonable fees and expenses in accordance with the provisions of the last sentence of subsection (e) of this section and the petitioner may continue to pursue any claims previously asserted on behalf of the corporation.\n\n(h) Any payment by the corporation pursuant to an order under subsection (c) or (e) of this section, other than an award of fees and expenses pursuant to subsection (e) of this section, is subject to the provisions of section 33-687 ."

For the purposes of this subsection, a showing of good cause shall include, but not be limited to, a showing that public disclosure of the residence addresses of the corporation's directors and officers may expose the personal security of such directors and officers to significant risk.\n\n(d) Each annual report shall be accompanied by the required filing fee. The report shall be executed as set forth in section 33-1004 . The Secretary of the State shall deliver to each domestic corporation at its principal office or electronic mail address, as shown by the Secretary's records, and to each foreign corporation authorized to conduct affairs in this state at its executive offices or electronic mail address, as last shown by the Secretary's records, notice that the annual report is due, but failure to receive such notice shall not relieve a corporation of the requirement of filing the report as provided in this section.\n\n(e) If any information required in the annual report, except for the corporation's name, changes after the corporation has filed its most current annual report and not later than thirty days preceding the month during which the corporation's next annual report becomes due, the corporation shall file with the Secretary of the State an amended annual report, which shall meet the requirements set forth in subsection (c) of this section. The filing fee for an amended annual report is twenty-five dollars."
