            "text": "(a) Members. The general administration and responsibility for the proper operation of the state employees retirement system is vested in a single board of trustees to be known as the Connecticut State Employees Retirement Commission. Notwithstanding the provisions of section 4-9a , the Retirement Commission shall consist of the following: (1) The Treasurer or a designee, who shall be a nonvoting, ex-officio member; (2) the Comptroller or a designee, who shall be a nonvoting, ex-officio member; (3) six trustees representing employees who shall (A) be appointed by the bargaining agents in accordance with the provisions of applicable collective bargaining agreements, (B) serve three-year terms, and (C) not be members of the same bargaining unit; (4) six management trustees who shall (A) be members of the state employees retirement system, (B) serve three-year terms, and (C) be appointed by the Governor; (5) two actuarial trustees who shall (A) be enrolled actuaries and Fellows of the Society of Actuaries, (B) serve three-year terms, and (C) be appointed by the Governor.

The chairman and the actuarial trustees shall be compensated at their normal and usual per diem fee, plus travel expenses, from the funds of the retirement system for each day of service to the commission. Each trustee shall, within ten days after appointment or election, take an oath of office that so far as it devolves upon the trustee, the trustee will diligently and honestly administer the affairs of the commission, and will not knowingly violate or willingly permit to be violated any of the provisions of law applicable to the state retirement system. Each trustee's term shall begin from the date the trustee takes such an oath. Each trustee shall be entitled to one vote on the commission. A majority of the commission shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of any business, the exercise of any power or the performance of any duty authorized or imposed by law. The State Employee Retirement Commission shall be within the Retirement Division of the office of the Comptroller for administrative purposes only. The Comptroller shall be the secretary of the commission and shall provide secretariat support to the commission.\n\n(b) Meetings. The Retirement Commission shall meet at least monthly and shall report to the Governor as provided in section 4-60 .\n\n(c) Powers and duties. The Retirement Commission shall administer this retirement system and all other state retirement and pension plans except the Teachers' Retirement Fund. The Retirement Commission shall have general supervision of the operation of the retirement system, shall conduct the business and activities of the system, in accordance with this chapter and applicable law and each trustee shall be a fiduciary with respect to the retirement system and its members. The Retirement Commission shall authorize the participation in an alternate retirement program by the eligible unclassified employees of the constituent units of the state system of higher education and the central office staff of the Board of Regents for Higher Education. Such program may be underwritten by a life insurance company licensed to do business in this state. In conducting the business of the system, including its oversight functions, the Retirement Commission shall act: (1) With the care, skill, prudence and diligence under the circumstances then prevailing that a prudent person acting in a like capacity and familiar with such matters would use in the conduct of an enterprise of a like character and with like aims; (2) in accordance with strict fiduciary standards and responsibilities; and (3) in accordance with the provisions of the general statutes and applicable collective bargaining agreements.\n\n(d) Social Security. The Retirement Commission shall act as agent for the state in all matters relating to the Social Security Agreement, except those matters set forth in parts four, nine and ten of said agreement. The Retirement Commission may make regulations as to maintaining membership under Social Security or conduct referenda as appropriate to secure Social Security coverage for state employees to the extent permitted by Section 218 of the Social Security Act.\n\n(e) Regulations. The Retirement Commission may adopt such regulations, in accordance with the provisions of chapter 54, as are necessary to carry out the provisions of this chapter and may establish rules and regulations which it deems necessary or desirable to facilitate the proper administration of the retirement system. Rules and regulations established by the commission shall be binding upon all parties dealing with the Retirement Commission and all persons claiming any benefits from the system provided that no regulation, rule, action or determination made or adopted by the Retirement Commission shall in any manner conflict or be inconsistent with any provision of an applicable current collective bargaining agreement in effect between any state employer and the unions representing employees.\n\n(f) Allocation and delegation of fiduciary responsibilities. The Retirement Commission may, by resolution or regulation, allocate fiduciary responsibilities and various administrative duties to committees or subcommittees of the Retirement Commission, and may delegate such responsibilities and duties to other individuals as it deems appropriate or necessary in its sole discretion and consistent with this section.\n\n(g) Hearings. The commission may hold hearings when deemed necessary in the performance of its duty. The hearings shall be governed by rules and regulations of the commission and the commission shall not be bound by technical rules of evidence.\n\n(h) General counsel. The commission may hire a general counsel who shall serve at the pleasure of the commission, have offices in the Retirement Division and perform duties as directed by the commission. The commission may obtain such additional legal advice and assistance as it deems advisable.\n\n(i) Reporting and disclosure. (1) All plans, descriptions and reports and all legal, financial and actuarial documents dealing with the general operations of the pension plan shall be available for inspection and copying by members and their representatives. The cost of any copying shall be borne by the member or representative, but shall not exceed twenty-five cents per page.\n\n(2) Each year the State Treasurer shall publish and forward to the commission a consolidated report showing the fiscal transactions of the system for the preceding fiscal year, including gain or loss by category of security, a reconciliation of assets showing the progression of the fund from one year to the next, the amount of the accumulated cash and securities of the system and the last balance sheet showing the financial condition of the system by means of an actuarial valuation of its assets and liabilities. Assets shall be shown at book and market value and by type or term of investment. Gain or loss shall be reported by category of security type. This requirement shall be satisfied if an Internal Revenue Service form 5500 is completed and submitted to the commission provided that the information included therein is sufficient to allow the computation of the investment yield of the fund on an annual basis. Each member shall receive a summary plan description within ninety days of employment and at least once in every four years thereafter. The commission shall notify members of substantial statutory plan amendments, if any, within two hundred ten days after their effective date.\n\n(3) Effective July 1, 1985, and annually thereafter, the commission shall provide each member with a statement that shows the individual's vested benefits or the benefits the member may be entitled to on vesting and the date on which the member will be vested, shows the amount of the member's accrued benefits, shows the name of the beneficiary, if any, of the member in case of death and shows the total amount of contributions paid by the member and the interest accrued, if any.\n\n(j) Claims procedure. Any claim for a pension or any other benefit which may become available in accordance with the provisions of this chapter may be submitted to the commission provided it is submitted in writing. Any such claim will be reviewed and decided by the commission. The claimant shall be advised of the processing status of his claim upon reasonable request.\n\n(k) Claims review and appeal procedure. If any claim is denied, a claimant may request that the decision be reviewed and reconsidered by the commission. Thereafter, any such case shall be decided as a contested case in accordance with chapter 54.\n\nSee Sec. 4-38f for definition of “administrative purposes only”."

The Retirement Commission shall, on or before December first, annually certify to the General Assembly the amount necessary on the basis of an actuarial determination to gradually establish and subsequently maintain the retirement fund on such determined actuarial reserve basis, and make such other recommendations with regard to such fund and its administration as the commission deems appropriate. The Retirement Commission shall, at least once every two years, prepare a valuation of the assets and liabilities of the system. On the basis of each such valuation, it shall redetermine the normal rate of contribution and, until it is amortized, the unfunded past service liability. The General Assembly shall review the commission's recommendations and certification and shall appropriate to the retirement fund the amount certified by the Retirement Commission as necessary provided said certification is in compliance with this section at the time of certification, and the amount so certified shall not be reduced or used for other than the purposes of this section.\n\n(2) Notwithstanding the provisions of subdivision (1) of this subsection, the Retirement Commission shall not finalize any valuation prepared pursuant to said subdivision, or certify the amount necessary to maintain the retirement fund on an actuarial reserve basis pursuant to said subdivision, until such valuation and certification account for any funds deemed to be appropriated to the State Employees Retirement Fund pursuant to subsection (c) of section 4-30a .\n\n(b) The Retirement Commission shall determine on an actuarial basis (1) a normal rate of contribution which the state shall be required to make into the retirement fund in order to meet the actuarial cost of current service and (2) the unfunded past service liability. For the first sixteen years, the funding program for the actuarial reserve basis shall consist of the following percentages of the sum of normal cost and the amount required for a forty-year amortization of unfunded liabilities:\n\nFiscal Year Beginning\n\nPercentage to be paid of normal cost plus full 40-year amortization from the beginning of such fiscal year\n\n7-1-71\n\n30\n\n7-1-72\n\n35\n\n7-1-73\n\n40\n\n7-1-74\n\n45\n\n7-1-75\n\n45\n\n7-1-76\n\n50\n\n7-1-77\n\n55\n\n7-1-78\n\n60\n\n7-1-79\n\n65\n\n7-1-80\n\n70\n\n7-1-81\n\n75\n\n7-1-82\n\n80\n\n7-1-83\n\n85\n\n7-1-84\n\n90\n\n7-1-85\n\n95\n\n7-1-86\n\n100\n\n7-1-87\n\n100\n\n7-1-88\n\n100\n\nprovided said state payments shall not be reduced or diverted to any purpose other than the payment into the retirement fund until the foregoing schedule of payments has been completed and said fund is determined to be actuarially sound.\n\n(c) Transfer of appropriated amounts from the General Fund to the retirement fund shall be made in equal monthly payments during the fiscal year.\n\n(d) No act liberalizing the benefits of the plan shall be enacted by the General Assembly until the assembly has requested and received from the Retirement Commission a certification of the cost of such change under the actuarial funding basis adopted by section 5-154 and this section using full normal cost plus forty-year amortization.\n\n(e) There shall be a valuation of the assets and liabilities of the system as of December 31, 1983, June 30, 1985, and June 30, 1986. The valuation of the assets and liabilities of the system as of December 31, 1983, shall reflect, to the greatest extent possible, any transfers made pursuant to section 5-158h and any service credits purchased by the date of the valuation.\n\n(f) The same actuarial cost method and assumptions as were employed in determining the certification for the fiscal year beginning July 1, 1982, shall be utilized for the annual Retirement Commission certification of the amount necessary to fund the system prior to the December 31, 1983, valuation, but shall reflect the increases in percentage indicated in subsection (b) of this section. The certification resulting from the December 31, 1982, valuation shall not estimate or otherwise reflect the effect of any contractual changes to the retirement system approved by the General Assembly on June 30, 1982, and effective on October 1, 1982.\n\n(g) For any appropriation based on an actuarial valuation undertaken on or after December 31, 1983, the Retirement Commission shall separately indicate the actuarial cost of current service for the members of tier II.

All other funding shall be in accordance with the provisions of subsections (a) and (b) of this section.\n\n(h) Any recovery of pension costs from an appropriated or nonappropriated source other than the General Fund or Special Transportation Fund that causes the payments to the State Employees Retirement System to exceed the actuarially determined employer contribution for any fiscal year shall be deposited into the State Employees Retirement Fund as an additional employer contribution at the end of such fiscal year."

The table shall be based on the unfunded past service liability generated by the valuation and shall reflect the fact that less than one hundred per cent of the normal cost and full forty-year amortization will be paid into the system prior to July 1, 1986. Such table shall not be adjusted in future years, except to the extent necessary to reflect changes in actuarial assumptions or actuarial cost methods approved by the Retirement Commission. Such table shall be used to determine whether an actuarial surplus exists in the system.\n\n(3) Within six months after each June thirtieth commencing with June 30, 1984, the Retirement Commission shall determine whether the retirement fund had an actuarial surplus for the completed year. Such surplus shall be deemed to exist if, and only if, the following three criteria are all met:\n\n(A) The investment return on the fund has exceeded the interest rate assumption employed for regular valuation purposes by the fund. The investment return for the fund shall be calculated by the following formula:\n\nWhere\n\nA is the market value of the fund, including any due but unpaid contribution, as of the first day of the fiscal year;\n\nB is the market value of the fund, including any due but unpaid contribution, as of the last day of the fiscal year; and\n\nI is the market value return of the fund, which shall be equal to B reduced by A, but increased by the total amount of benefits and expenses paid from the fund during the year, and decreased by the total amount of employer and employee contributions for that year, whether or not paid;\n\n(B) The market value of the system's assets as of the appropriate June thirtieth was greater than fifty per cent of the sum of (i) the liability for retired members and their beneficiaries; (ii) the liability for former members entitled to a deferred vested benefit; and (iii) the then current value of employee contributions, plus interest, for active members. In determining such liabilities, the fund's actuary shall recognize future cost-of-living adjustments provided under tier I and tier II and shall employ the actuarial assumptions utilized for regular valuation purposes. The actuary may utilize reasonable estimates to make such calculations; and\n\n(C) The actual unfunded past service liability of the system as of the appropriate June thirtieth was less than the expected unfunded past service liability as indicated by the table developed pursuant to subdivision (2) of this subsection for the June thirtieth five years later. In determining the actual unfunded past service liability, the actuary shall employ the actuarial assumptions and procedures utilized for the last regular valuation. The actuary may utilize reasonable estimates to make such calculations."

Thereafter, disability retirement continues only if such member is totally disabled for any suitable and comparable job. If the member's disability occurs on or after October 1, 1982, such disability retirement income shall equal three per cent of the member's base salary multiplied by years of service to date of disability, subject to a maximum of one and two-thirds per cent times years of service projected to age sixty-five and a minimum of one and two-thirds per cent times years of service to the date of disability, except that such income of state policemen shall be determined as provided by subsection (b) of section 5-173 .",
              "(b) If a member, while in state service, becomes permanently disabled from continuing to render the service in which he has been employed as a result of any injury received while in the performance of his duty as a state employee, such member is eligible for disability retirement regardless of his period of state service. If the member's disability occurs on or after October 1, 1982, such disability retirement income shall equal one and two-thirds per cent times years of service projected to age sixty-five with a maximum based on not more than thirty years of such service and a minimum of one and two-thirds per cent times accrued service at the date of disability, except that such income of state policemen shall be determined as provided by subsection (b) of section 5-173 , provided, for the purposes of the formulas in said subsection, his rate of salary at the time of his disability retirement shall be used if greater than his base salary. If such injury occurred on or after October 1, 1982, and such member has completed at least five years of state service, his disability retirement income shall in no event be less than that provided under subsection (a) of this section.",

Three of such members, one of whom shall be the elected chairman or the elected secretary of the board, shall constitute a quorum for the determination of any applicant's entitlement. The chairman or the secretary shall report the findings of the board to the Retirement Commission from time to time as requested by the commission as to the entitlement of each applicant or the continuance of disability of members so retired.

In such event, such member shall receive credit for the years he was disabled, subject to a maximum total credit of twenty-five years or actual years of service to the date of disability, whichever is greater.

The foregoing limitation shall not apply to credit obtained immediately after transfer from the teachers' retirement system under section 10-183p for service previously credited in said system; but in that case no benefit for retirement on account of disability occurring within such five-year period, other than for injury received in performance of duty as a state employee, shall exceed the benefit which would have been payable by said system if transfer had not been made.",

Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this section, the following maximum benefit limitations shall apply if the member's date of disability occurs on or after January 1, 1984. Such maximum benefit limitations shall apply coincident with the receipt of benefits under subsection (d) of section 5-142 by any member of the Division of State Police within the Department of Emergency Services and Public Protection. To verify the operation of the maximums, members shall authorize the Social Security Administration to provide the Retirement Commission, on an ongoing basis, any information with regard to covered earnings or Social Security benefits payable. In the event both of the maximums indicated below apply, the lesser disability benefit shall be payable. Such maximums shall be subject to reexamination annually, as indicated in subsection (h) of this section.",

Any such determination that such earned salary or wages is for rehabilitation must be reapproved by the Retirement Commission no less frequently than every eighteen months, or the offset shall apply. The offset for workers' compensation and federal Social Security disability benefits shall apply when such benefits commence even if such benefits initially commence after the member's disability retirement date.",
              "(2) The disability benefit provided under this section shall not exceed eighty per cent of the member's base salary or the rate of salary of the member on the date of disability, whichever is greater, less any periodic cash benefit payments being made to a member under the Workers' Compensation Act, less any federal disability Social Security benefits, including primary and family, being paid on account of the member's Social Security earnings history. The offsets shall apply when such benefits commence even if such benefits initially commence after the member's disability retirement date.",
              "(3) The offsets for workers' compensation and federal Social Security disability benefits shall be reduced by the amount of any attorney's fees a member incurs to obtain such benefits.",
              "(h) As of each anniversary date, as defined in section 5-162d , of such retired employee, the benefits provided under this section shall be subject to the following adjustments: (1) The benefits provided in subsections (a) and (b) of this section shall be subject to the increase provided in section 5-162d or 5-162h , whichever is appropriate; (2) the net maximum benefit provided in subdivision (2) of subsection (g) of this section shall be subject to the increase provided in section 5-162d or 5-162h , whichever is appropriate; (3) this subdivision shall apply only to the maximum benefit provided in subdivision (1) of subsection (g) of this section which shall only be considered if the member had outside earned salary or wages. The salary as described in subdivision (1) of subsection (g) of this section shall be increased by the percentage compensation increase that would have applied to an employee in the position and “step” of the member, at the date of disability had that employee continued to be employed and continued automatic progression to the maximum “step” for his classification. On the date of recomputation of benefits, the offsets for workers' compensation and federal Social Security shall be increased by that same percentage or the percentage increase granted under the cost-of-living provision of the Workers' Compensation Act and the Social Security Act respectively, whichever is less. This offset amount shall be adjusted to reflect any change in these benefits other than those resulting from the cost-of-living provisions of the Workers' Compensation Act or the Social Security Act. In no case shall the offset be greater than the actual benefits paid. Outside earned salary or wages shall reflect actual amounts earned during the preceding calendar year. In no event shall the application of this subdivision and subdivision (1) of subsection (g) of this section result in an income from all sources that would be less than the income that would have been paid had the member remained in service and progressed to the maximum “step” for his classification; (4) except as specifically indicated in subdivision (3) of this subsection, the maximum disability income determined under subsection (g) of this section will not be affected, when the workers' compensation benefits or the Social Security benefits are increased by cost-of-living provisions in the Workers' Compensation Act or the Social Security Act; (5) the maximum disability income under subdivision (2) of subsection (g) of this section will be recalculated if either the workers' compensation benefits or the Social Security benefits are decreased or discontinued. Any such recalculated maximum shall not reflect any increases arising after the initial application of the offset because of the cost-of-living provisions in the Workers' Compensation Act or the Social Security Act, except as specifically indicated in subdivision (3) of this subsection.",
              "(i) If a member qualifies for disability compensation under section 5-142 , such member shall continue to be credited with service hereunder, and shall not be deemed to have retired until he elects to retire. While the member is receiving compensation under section 5-142 , the disability retirement benefits under this section shall be payable only if greater than the compensation paid under section 5-142 . In such event, the benefits under this section shall be temporarily reduced by the amount of benefits payable under section 5-142 for the period of receipt of benefits under section 5-142 . If a member is granted disability compensation under section 5-142 retroactively for the same period of time such member received disability retirement benefits under this section, such disability compensation benefits shall be reduced by the amount of disability retirement benefits received during such period, except that if the disability retirement benefits received during such period were greater than the retroactive payment of disability compensation benefits for such period, no disability compensation payments shall be paid to the member for such period.",
              "(j) A member whose date of disability occurs prior to January 1, 1984, shall have his benefits calculated in accordance with the provisions of law in effect at the time of such occurrence. A member's date of disability shall be his last date of active employment by the state prior to such disability or the date as of which his benefits under this section are payable, whichever is earlier. A leave of absence for medical reasons shall not be deemed to be active employment.",
              "(k) If after review of all testimony and documentary evidence, including medical reports, presented in connection with any determination or recommendation concerning entitlement to or continuation of disability retirement, any member of the board who believes that an individual was treated by a physician who is or may be unable to practice medicine with reasonable skill or safety, shall file a petition, pursuant to section 20-13d , with the Department of Public Health for investigation under section 20-13e . The record of the board concerning any such petition, and the proceedings of the board in connection therewith, shall remain confidential to the same extent as a record of the Department of Public Health under section 20-13e .",

            "text": "(a) If a member of the state employees retirement system, while in state service, becomes permanently disabled prior to the age of sixty from continuing to render the service in which he has been employed, and if he has then completed five years of state service, such member is eligible for disability retirement for twenty-four months. Thereafter, disability retirement continues only if such member is totally disabled for any suitable and comparable job. If the member's disability occurs on or after October 1, 1982, such disability retirement income shall equal three per cent of the member's base salary multiplied by years of service to date of disability, subject to a maximum of one and two-thirds per cent times years of service projected to age sixty-five and a minimum of one and two-thirds per cent times years of service to the date of disability, except that such income of state policemen shall be determined as provided by subsection (b) of section 5-173 .\n\n(b) If a member, while in state service, becomes permanently disabled from continuing to render the service in which he has been employed as a result of any injury received while in the performance of his duty as a state employee, such member is eligible for disability retirement regardless of his period of state service. If the member's disability occurs on or after October 1, 1982, such disability retirement income shall equal one and two-thirds per cent times years of service projected to age sixty-five with a maximum based on not more than thirty years of such service and a minimum of one and two-thirds per cent times accrued service at the date of disability, except that such income of state policemen shall be determined as provided by subsection (b) of section 5-173 , provided, for the purposes of the formulas in said subsection, his rate of salary at the time of his disability retirement shall be used if greater than his base salary. If such injury occurred on or after October 1, 1982, and such member has completed at least five years of state service, his disability retirement income shall in no event be less than that provided under subsection (a) of this section.\n\n(c) The Governor shall appoint a board of seven physicians, each of whom is a current or retired state employee and two of whom shall be experienced in psychiatry, to serve at his pleasure as a medical examining board to determine whether each applicant for disability retirement is entitled thereto. Three of such members, one of whom shall be the elected chairman or the elected secretary of the board, shall constitute a quorum for the determination of any applicant's entitlement. The chairman or the secretary shall report the findings of the board to the Retirement Commission from time to time as requested by the commission as to the entitlement of each applicant or the continuance of disability of members so retired. The Comptroller is authorized to pay for stenographic and professional services as requested and approved by the board.\n\n(d) No reconsideration of a decision concerning eligibility for a disability retirement allowance or the discontinuance of such allowance shall be made by the board unless a member, upon application to the board for a redetermination, discloses additional facts concerning his condition at the date of termination of employment.\n\n(e) Retirement income being paid for disability retirement shall end when and if the disability ends. In such event, such member shall receive credit for the years he was disabled, subject to a maximum total credit of twenty-five years or actual years of service to the date of disability, whichever is greater. Such member shall then (1) retire on normal or early retirement, if eligible, or (2) retain a vested right to a deferred pension, if eligible.\n\n(f) No credit for a period of service of any kind prior to the months in which contribution therefor is made shall be given under this chapter or any special act in determining state service in connection with an application for disability retirement other than for injury received in performance of duty as a state employee, if such disability occurred within five years after payment of a single lump sum or commencement of payroll deductions pursuant to subsection (c) of section 5-167 . The foregoing limitation shall not apply to credit obtained immediately after transfer from the teachers' retirement system under section 10-183p for service previously credited in said system; but in that case no benefit for retirement on account of disability occurring within such five-year period, other than for injury received in performance of duty as a state employee, shall exceed the benefit which would have been payable by said system if transfer had not been made.\n\n(g) Twenty per cent of all outside earned salary or wages shall be offset against the disability retirement payments by the state during the first two years of disability. On or after October 1, 1987, at the expiration of such period, if the total disability benefits and outside earnings exceed one hundred per cent of the pay of such member at the date of disability, adjusted annually by a percentage increase equal to the cost of living allowances applied to the member's disability retirement benefits pursuant to this chapter, the disability payment will be reduced by the amount such total exceeds such adjusted earnings. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this section, the following maximum benefit limitations shall apply if the member's date of disability occurs on or after January 1, 1984. Such maximum benefit limitations shall apply coincident with the receipt of benefits under subsection (d) of section 5-142 by any member of the Division of State Police within the Department of Emergency Services and Public Protection. To verify the operation of the maximums, members shall authorize the Social Security Administration to provide the Retirement Commission, on an ongoing basis, any information with regard to covered earnings or Social Security benefits payable. In the event both of the maximums indicated below apply, the lesser disability benefit shall be payable. Such maximums shall be subject to reexamination annually, as indicated in subsection (h) of this section.\n\n(1) The disability benefit provided under this section shall not exceed one hundred per cent of the member's base salary or the rate of salary of the member on his date of disability, whichever is greater, less any periodic cash benefit payments being made to a member under the Workers' Compensation Act, less any federal disability Social Security benefits, including primary and family, paid on account of the member's Social Security earnings history, less all outside earned salary or wages, unless the Retirement Commission determines that such salary or wages are being paid as part of the rehabilitation of the disabled member. Any such determination that such earned salary or wages is for rehabilitation must be reapproved by the Retirement Commission no less frequently than every eighteen months, or the offset shall apply. The offset for workers' compensation and federal Social Security disability benefits shall apply when such benefits commence even if such benefits initially commence after the member's disability retirement date.\n\n(2) The disability benefit provided under this section shall not exceed eighty per cent of the member's base salary or the rate of salary of the member on the date of disability, whichever is greater, less any periodic cash benefit payments being made to a member under the Workers' Compensation Act, less any federal disability Social Security benefits, including primary and family, being paid on account of the member's Social Security earnings history. The offsets shall apply when such benefits commence even if such benefits initially commence after the member's disability retirement date.\n\n(3) The offsets for workers' compensation and federal Social Security disability benefits shall be reduced by the amount of any attorney's fees a member incurs to obtain such benefits.\n\n(h) As of each anniversary date, as defined in section 5-162d , of such retired employee, the benefits provided under this section shall be subject to the following adjustments: (1) The benefits provided in subsections (a) and (b) of this section shall be subject to the increase provided in section 5-162d or 5-162h , whichever is appropriate; (2) the net maximum benefit provided in subdivision (2) of subsection (g) of this section shall be subject to the increase provided in section 5-162d or 5-162h , whichever is appropriate; (3) this subdivision shall apply only to the maximum benefit provided in subdivision (1) of subsection (g) of this section which shall only be considered if the member had outside earned salary or wages. The salary as described in subdivision (1) of subsection (g) of this section shall be increased by the percentage compensation increase that would have applied to an employee in the position and “step” of the member, at the date of disability had that employee continued to be employed and continued automatic progression to the maximum “step” for his classification. On the date of recomputation of benefits, the offsets for workers' compensation and federal Social Security shall be increased by that same percentage or the percentage increase granted under the cost-of-living provision of the Workers' Compensation Act and the Social Security Act respectively, whichever is less. This offset amount shall be adjusted to reflect any change in these benefits other than those resulting from the cost-of-living provisions of the Workers' Compensation Act or the Social Security Act. In no case shall the offset be greater than the actual benefits paid. Outside earned salary or wages shall reflect actual amounts earned during the preceding calendar year. In no event shall the application of this subdivision and subdivision (1) of subsection (g) of this section result in an income from all sources that would be less than the income that would have been paid had the member remained in service and progressed to the maximum “step” for his classification; (4) except as specifically indicated in subdivision (3) of this subsection, the maximum disability income determined under subsection (g) of this section will not be affected, when the workers' compensation benefits or the Social Security benefits are increased by cost-of-living provisions in the Workers' Compensation Act or the Social Security Act; (5) the maximum disability income under subdivision (2) of subsection (g) of this section will be recalculated if either the workers' compensation benefits or the Social Security benefits are decreased or discontinued. Any such recalculated maximum shall not reflect any increases arising after the initial application of the offset because of the cost-of-living provisions in the Workers' Compensation Act or the Social Security Act, except as specifically indicated in subdivision (3) of this subsection.\n\n(i) If a member qualifies for disability compensation under section 5-142 , such member shall continue to be credited with service hereunder, and shall not be deemed to have retired until he elects to retire. While the member is receiving compensation under section 5-142 , the disability retirement benefits under this section shall be payable only if greater than the compensation paid under section 5-142 . In such event, the benefits under this section shall be temporarily reduced by the amount of benefits payable under section 5-142 for the period of receipt of benefits under section 5-142 . If a member is granted disability compensation under section 5-142 retroactively for the same period of time such member received disability retirement benefits under this section, such disability compensation benefits shall be reduced by the amount of disability retirement benefits received during such period, except that if the disability retirement benefits received during such period were greater than the retroactive payment of disability compensation benefits for such period, no disability compensation payments shall be paid to the member for such period.\n\n(j) A member whose date of disability occurs prior to January 1, 1984, shall have his benefits calculated in accordance with the provisions of law in effect at the time of such occurrence. A member's date of disability shall be his last date of active employment by the state prior to such disability or the date as of which his benefits under this section are payable, whichever is earlier. A leave of absence for medical reasons shall not be deemed to be active employment.\n\n(k) If after review of all testimony and documentary evidence, including medical reports, presented in connection with any determination or recommendation concerning entitlement to or continuation of disability retirement, any member of the board who believes that an individual was treated by a physician who is or may be unable to practice medicine with reasonable skill or safety, shall file a petition, pursuant to section 20-13d , with the Department of Public Health for investigation under section 20-13e . The record of the board concerning any such petition, and the proceedings of the board in connection therewith, shall remain confidential to the same extent as a record of the Department of Public Health under section 20-13e .\n\nSee Sec. 18-101e re calculation of disability retirement income for correction officers upon designation of extraordinary circumstances."

Any veteran who becomes a member on or after July 1, 1975, shall not receive credit for such war or military service if such member has received or is entitled to receive any retirement allowance for the same years of such service from the federal government. Any veteran who is a member and who has not made application for such credit prior to July 1, 1975, shall not receive credit for such service if such member has received or is entitled to receive any retirement allowance for the same years of such service from the federal government unless such member makes application for such credit to the Retirement Commission on or before October 1, 1975, and makes retirement contributions for each month of such service in accordance with the provisions of this subsection. The Comptroller of the state may notify each employee of this provision on or before September 1, 1975. Such contributions shall equal one-twelfth of four per cent of his first year's salary as a state employee multiplied by the total number of months of such war service or national emergency service and, if such employee became a member after April 1, 1958, shall be accompanied by interest at four per cent per year from the time such war service was rendered or from September 1, 1939, whichever is later, until the date of payment or January 1, 1962, whichever is earlier. Such contributions may be paid by payroll deductions as determined by the Retirement Commission over a period not to exceed thirty-six months, interest thereon to be paid not later than the last day of the month following the payment of the last of such deductions. Service credit for retirement purposes shall not be granted unless payment of contributions and interest is completed. No credit shall be given hereunder for military service during a national emergency to any state employee who has served less than ten years as a permanent full-time state employee, nor for any such military service beyond a total period of his compulsory service, if any, plus three years.\n\n(c) A member who leaves state service for the sole purpose of entering the armed forces of the United States may make his retirement contributions while in the armed forces in the monthly amount he was making immediately before he left state service. Such contributions shall be deducted from any salary payable to the member during his absence. Alternately, if no salary was payable to him, he may make such contributions after his return to state service, with interest thereon at five per cent per year from a date six months after he left the armed forces, provided he shall make application for return to state service within ninety days after he has received a certificate for satisfactory service from the armed forces. No contributions may be made, however, at any time for service in the armed forces beyond a total period of his compulsory service therein, if any, plus three years."

              "(a) A member of tier II may elect one of the following optional forms for retirement income by filing with the Retirement Commission a written election on a form provided by the commission. A member who has been married at least one year will be presumed to elect the option offered under subdivision (1) of this subsection unless a contrary election is made by the member. All other members will be presumed to elect the option offered under subdivision (4) of this subsection unless a contrary election is made by the member. Any election or change of election must be filed before retirement income payments begin. No option shall be effective until a member has retired, and in the event a member dies prior to the date benefits would have commenced, any election of an option shall be deemed cancelled except as provided in subsection (c) of section 5-192r . The amount of income that will be paid under the options will be determined by multiplying the retirement income as determined under sections 5-192 l to 5-192p , inclusive, as applicable, by the actuarially equivalent option factors last adopted by the Retirement Commission. Such factors shall be identical to those provided under section 5-165 unless the Retirement Commission shall determine otherwise. The factors may be periodically adjusted upward or downward by the Retirement Commission to reflect changing interest, mortality, or election of option patterns, provided that they shall be reviewed and adjusted by January 1, 1985. Any such changes shall apply only to members whose benefits commence after the effective date of adoption of such factors. The retirement options are as follows: (1) A reduced amount payable to the member for his lifetime, with the provision that after his death his spouse, if surviving, shall be entitled to receive a lifetime income equal to fifty per cent of the reduced monthly amount payable to the member; (2) a reduced amount payable to the member for his lifetime, with the provision that after his death, his contingent annuitant shall be entitled to receive a lifetime income equal to either fifty or one hundred per cent of the reduced amount payable to the member; (3) a reduced amount payable to the member for his lifetime, with the provision that if he shall die within either a ten or twenty-year period following the date his retirement income commences, whichever is selected by the member, the reduced amount continues to his contingent annuitant for the balance of the ten or twenty-year period, respectively; or (4) an amount payable to the member for his lifetime, with no payments continuing after the member's death.",
              "(b) Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (a) of this section, a temporary minimum shall apply whenever the Retirement Commission adopts revised factors which could result in a smaller benefit to a member than would have been payable under the previously existing factors. Such minimum shall be determined as follows: (1) The benefit the member had earned as of the date of the change in factors shall be calculated, based on his final average earnings and credited service or based on his vesting service as of that date; (2) any early retirement reduction in such benefit shall be based upon his age as determined on the date benefits will commence, and his type of retirement; and (3) the option factor shall be determined utilizing the factors in effect prior to such change, but based on appropriate ages as of the date benefits will commence. If such minimum results in a larger benefit, the larger benefit shall be payable."

Such notice shall set forth the reasons for dismissal in sufficient detail to indicate whether the employee was discharged for misconduct, incompetence or other reasons relating to the effective performance of the employee's duties and shall be prepared in such form and given in such manner as the Secretary of the Office of Policy and Management prescribes. The Secretary of the Office of Policy and Management may provide by regulation for the waiving of advance notice in cases of serious misconduct by an employee affecting the public, the welfare, health or safety of patients, inmates or state employees or the protection of state property. Such regulation shall provide for written notice to a permanent employee who has attained permanent status and shall not preclude whatever rights any employee may have to appeal. The name of any such employee dismissed for incompetence or other reasons relating to the effective performance of the employee's duties shall be immediately removed from the eligible list in the office of the Commissioner of Administrative Services. No appointing authority shall pay any dismissed employee notice period pay or any other separation pay at a rate that exceeds the dismissed employee's rate of compensation, at the time of dismissal, for two weeks, or the amount of notice period provided for in an applicable collective bargaining agreement.\n\n(d) An appointing authority, subject to any regulations issued by the Secretary of the Office of Policy and Management, may lay off any employee in the classified service as provided in section 5-241 .\n\n(e) (1) As provided in subsection (b) of section 12-15 , the Commissioner of Revenue Services may, subject to such terms and conditions as said commissioner may prescribe, disclose return or return information, as defined in said section 12-15 , in connection with a personnel proceeding, including any administrative or judicial proceedings related thereto, involving an employee or former employee of the Department of Revenue Services, if said commissioner determines that such information is relevant and material to such proceeding. If such return or return information is relevant and material to such proceeding, the commissioner shall, upon request made by the employee or former employee who is the subject of such proceeding, disclose such return or return information to such employee or former employee, or the collective bargaining agent for such employee or former employee, regardless of whether the commissioner introduces or otherwise relies upon such return or return information during the course of the proceeding. Return and return information disclosed under this subsection shall be used only for purposes of and to the extent necessary in such proceeding and shall not be further disclosed by any person involved in such proceeding.\n\n(2) Any person who violates any provision of this subsection shall be fined not more than one thousand dollars or imprisoned not more than one year, or both."

In no case shall a retired employee be required to contribute to the cost of any such reduced insurance. For the purposes of this section, no employee shall be deemed to be retired as long as such employee's employment continues under subsections (b) and (d) of section 5-164 .\n\n(e) In addition to any life insurance coverage available pursuant to subsection (b) of this section, optional group life insurance coverage up to a maximum of fifty thousand dollars may be purchased by any employee who is not included in any prevailing bargaining unit contract and whose yearly gross compensation is at least forty-five thousand five hundred dollars.

To challenge, an intervening organization must show that at least ten per cent or more of the employees of the unit seek to be the exclusive representative. Any additional organization meeting said ten per cent prerequisite shall be treated, upon request, as an additional intervenor; (3) if there is a challenge, or if the board certifies that thirty per cent or more but less than a majority of employees in a bargaining unit desire to be exclusively represented by a particular organization, said board shall direct an election by secret ballot to determine whether and by which employee organization the employees desire to be represented and shall certify the results thereof. The board shall refer the petition to its agent who shall investigate the petition and issue a direction of election and conduct a secret ballot election to determine whether and by which employee organization the employees desire to be represented if he has reasonable cause to believe that a question of representation exists, or issue a recommendation to dismiss the petition if he finds that there is not such reasonable cause, or refer the petition to the board for a hearing without having conducted an election or issuing a recommendation of dismissal, in which event the board shall conduct an appropriate hearing upon due notice. The agent shall report his action to the board. The board shall issue an order confirming the agent's direction of election and certifying the results of the election, or issue an order confirming the agent's recommendation for dismissal, or order a further investigation, or provide for an appropriate hearing upon due notice. Before taking any of the aforesaid actions, the board shall provide the parties with an opportunity to file briefs on the questions at issue and shall fully consider any such briefs filed. After a hearing, the board shall order any of the aforesaid actions on the petition, or shall upon good cause order any other suitable method to determine whether and by which employee organization the employees desire to be represented.

No petition seeking a clarification or modification of an existing unit shall be considered to be timely by the board during the term of a written collective bargaining agreement, except that a petition for clarification or modification filed by an employee organization concerning either (1) a newly created position or (2) any employee who is not represented by an employee organization, may be filed at any time."

The arbitrator shall immediately and simultaneously distribute a copy thereof to each party. In making such award, the arbitrator shall select the more reasonable last best offer proposal on each of the disputed issues based on the factors in subdivision (5) of this subsection. The arbitrator (A) shall give a decision as to each disputed issue considered, (B) shall state with particularity the basis for such decision as to each disputed issue and the manner in which the factors enumerated in subdivision (5) of this subsection were considered in arriving at such decision, (C) shall confine the award to the issues submitted and shall not make observations or declarations of opinion which are not directly essential in reaching a determination, and (D) shall not affect the rights accorded to either party by law or by any collective bargaining agreement nor in any manner, either by drawing inferences or otherwise, modify, add to, subtract from or alter such provisions of law or agreement.

Such motion to vacate or modify shall identify the specific issue or issues in the award which the court is being asked to vacate or modify. Any decision by the arbitrator on issues that are not subject to a motion to vacate or modify shall be final and binding upon the parties. The court, after hearing, may vacate or modify the arbitrator's decision concerning the award or any issue in the award only if the court finds that substantial rights of a party have been prejudiced because such award is: (A) In violation of constitutional provisions; (B) in excess of the statutory authority of the arbitrator; (C) made upon unlawful procedure; (D) affected by other error of law; (E) clearly erroneous in view of the reliable, probative and substantial evidence of the whole record; or (F) arbitrary or capricious or characterized by abuse of discretion or clearly unwarranted exercise of discretion.",

Negotiations shall commence within thirty days of such service. Negotiations as to wage reopeners shall commence within twenty days of receipt by one party of a written notice with respect thereto, served in accordance with the provisions of any such reopener in the affected contract or, if none is stated therein, not more than sixty days or less than thirty days prior to the effective date of such reopener.\n\n(b) Upon the joint request of the parties, following the commencement of good faith negotiations, the State Board of Mediation and Arbitration may designate a mediator to assist the parties in continuing such negotiations and in reaching a settlement of the issues presented in such negotiations. The mediator designated shall be experienced in labor mediation and shall be drawn from lists of such mediators maintained by the board, the American Arbitration Association or the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service. The mediator so designated may only serve if approved by both parties.\n\n(c) If, after a reasonable period of negotiation, or, in the case of negotiations by the parties to an existing collective bargaining agreement to revise such agreement concerning any matter affecting wages, hours and other conditions of employment, after sixty days from the commencement of such negotiations, the parties are unable to reach an agreement, both parties or either of them may initiate arbitration by filing with the State Board of Mediation and Arbitration a list of the issues as to which an impasse has been reached. If such filing is not made jointly, a copy of the filing shall be served on the other party.\n\n(d) Within ten days of a joint filing or within ten days of service on the other party in the case of a single filing, the parties shall jointly select an arbitrator. The person selected shall have substantial, current experience as an impartial arbitrator of labor-management disputes. Persons who serve partisan interests as advocates or consultants for labor or management in labor-management relations or who are associated with or are members of a firm which performs such advocate or consultant work may not be selected. If the parties fail to agree on an arbitrator within the ten-day period, the selection shall be made using the procedures under the voluntary labor arbitration rules of the American Arbitration Association.\n\n(e) (1) The arbitrator selected shall contact the parties to schedule dates and places for hearings which shall commence not later than twenty days after the selection of the arbitrator and which shall be, where feasible, in the principal locality of the state board, department, commission or agency or unit thereof involved. At least ten days prior to each such hearing, written notice of the designated time and place of such hearing shall be sent to the state employer and the state employee organization. The arbitrator shall preside over such hearings, shall have the power to take testimony, to administer oaths and to summon, by subpoena, any person whose testimony may be pertinent to the proceedings, together with any records or other documents deemed by the arbitrator to relate to such matters. In the case of contumacy or refusal to obey a subpoena issued to any person, the Superior Court, upon application by the arbitrator or either party, shall have jurisdiction to order such person to appear before the arbitrator to produce subpoenaed records and to give testimony touching the matter under investigation or in question, and any failure to obey such order may be punished by the court as a contempt thereof. The parties may, at any time during the course of the proceeding, jointly request the arbitrator to attempt to mediate any or all of the disputed issues.\n\n(2) The hearings may, at the discretion of the parties or the arbitrator, be continued and shall be concluded within thirty days after their commencement, unless such period is extended by the joint request of the parties or by the arbitrator.\n\n(3) Prior to the commencement of the hearings, each party shall submit to the arbitrator three copies of a list of all resolved and unresolved issues, including the party's proposal on each disputed issue. During the hearing no new issues can be considered unless such addition is mutually agreed to by the parties. Upon receipt of both such lists, the arbitrator shall simultaneously distribute a copy of each to the opposing party. Upon the hearing, each party shall present such testimony and other evidence as it deems appropriate and as the arbitrator finds relevant to the issues presented. Evidence as to each disputed issue shall be presented first by the party presenting the demand underlying such issue. At any time prior to the issuance of the award by the arbitrator, the parties may jointly file with the arbitrator stipulations setting forth such disputed issues the parties have agreed are to be withdrawn from arbitration. Within fourteen days after the conclusion of the taking of testimony, the parties may file with the arbitrator three copies of their briefs including their last best offer on each unresolved issue and, where possible, estimates of the costs of resolution of each disputed issue. Immediately upon receipt of both briefs or upon the expiration of the time for filing such briefs, whichever is sooner, the arbitrator shall distribute a copy of each such brief to the opposing party. Within seven days after receipt of the opposing briefs on the disputed issues or within seven days after the expiration of the time for filing such briefs, whichever is sooner, the parties may file with the arbitrator three copies of a reply brief, responding to the briefs on the unresolved issues. Immediately upon receipt of both reply briefs or upon the expiration of the time for filing such briefs, whichever is sooner, the arbitrator shall distribute a copy of each such brief to the opposing party.\n\n(4) Within twenty days after the last day for filing reply briefs, the arbitrator shall file with the secretary of the State Board of Mediation and Arbitration the award on each unresolved issue as well as the issues resolved by the parties during the arbitration proceedings.

Such motion to vacate or modify shall identify the specific issue or issues in the award which the court is being asked to vacate or modify. Any decision by the arbitrator on issues that are not subject to a motion to vacate or modify shall be final and binding upon the parties.

The agreement, together with a request for funds necessary to fully implement such agreement and for approval of any provisions of the agreement which are in conflict with any statute or any regulation of any state agency, and any arbitration award, issued in accordance with section 5-276a , together with a statement setting forth the amount of funds necessary to implement such award, shall be filed by the bargaining representative of the employer with the clerks of the House of Representatives and the Senate within ten days after the date on which such agreement is reached or such award is distributed. The General Assembly may approve any such agreement as a whole by a majority vote of each house or may reject such agreement as a whole by a majority vote of either house. The General Assembly may reject any such award as a whole by a two-thirds vote of either house if it determines that there are insufficient funds for full implementation of the award.\n\n(2) (A) If an agreement is rejected, the matter shall be returned to the parties, who shall initiate arbitration in accordance with the provisions of section 5-276a . The parties may submit any award issued pursuant to such arbitration to the General Assembly for approval in the same manner as the rejected agreement. If the arbitration award is rejected by the General Assembly, the matter shall be returned again to the parties for further arbitration. Any award issued pursuant to such further arbitration shall be deemed approved by the General Assembly.\n\n(B) If an arbitration award, other than an award issued pursuant to subparagraph (A) of this subdivision, is rejected, the matter shall be returned to the parties for further arbitration. Any award issued pursuant to such further arbitration shall be deemed approved by the General Assembly.\n\n(3) Once approved by the General Assembly, any provision of an agreement or award need not be resubmitted by the parties to such agreement or award as part of a future contract approval process unless changes in the language of such provision are negotiated by such parties. Any supplemental understanding reached between such parties containing provisions which would supersede any provision of the general statutes or any regulation of any state agency or would require additional state funding shall be submitted to the General Assembly for approval in the same manner as agreements and awards. If the General Assembly is in session, it shall vote to approve or reject such agreement or award within thirty days after the date of filing. If the General Assembly is not in session when such agreement or award is filed, it shall be submitted to the General Assembly within ten days of the first day of the next regular session or special session called for such purpose. The agreement or award shall be deemed rejected if the General Assembly fails to vote to approve or reject such agreement or award within thirty days after such filing or submission. The thirty-day period shall not begin or expire unless the General Assembly is in regular session. For the purpose of this subsection, any agreement or award filed with the clerks within thirty days before the commencement of a regular session of the General Assembly shall be deemed to be filed on the first day of such session.\n\n(4) Each house of the General Assembly shall permit not more than six hours of total time for debate of a resolution to approve or reject an agreement or award filed with the clerks of the House of Representatives and the Senate pursuant to this subsection. Those speaking in favor of such resolution shall be allocated not more than three hours of total time for debate, and those speaking in opposition to such resolution shall be allocated not more than three hours of total time for debate. A vote shall be taken on the resolution upon the conclusion of the debate.\n\n(5) Notwithstanding the provisions of subdivision (4) of this subsection, if the debate on such resolution occurs during the last three days of the thirty-day period, each house of the General Assembly shall permit not more than four hours of total time for debate of such resolution. Those speaking in favor of such resolution shall be allocated not more than two hours of total time for debate and those speaking in opposition to such resolution shall be allocated not more than two hours of total time for debate. A vote shall be taken on the resolution upon the conclusion of the debate.\n\n(c) Notwithstanding any provision of any general statute or special act to the contrary, the legislature shall appropriate whatever funds are required to comply with a collective bargaining agreement, supplemental understanding or arbitration award, provided the request called for in subsection (b) of this section has been approved by the legislature.\n\n(d) No provision of any general statute or special act shall prevent negotiations between an employer and an employee organization which has been designated as the exclusive representative of employees in an appropriate unit, from continuing after the final date for setting the state budget. An agreement between an employer and an employee organization shall be valid and in force under its terms when entered into in accordance with the provisions of this chapter and signed by the chief executive officer or administrator as a ministerial act. Such terms may make any such agreement effective on a date prior to the date on which the agreement is entered. No publication thereof shall be required to make it effective. The procedure for the making of an agreement between the employer and an employee organization provided by sections 5-270 to 5-280 , inclusive, shall be the exclusive method for making a valid agreement for employees represented by an employee organization, and any provisions in any general statute or special act to the contrary shall not apply to such an agreement.\n\n(e) (1) Except as provided in subdivision (2) of this subsection, where there is a conflict between any agreement or arbitration award approved in accordance with the provisions of sections 5-270 to 5-280 , inclusive, on matters appropriate to collective bargaining, as defined in said sections, and any general statute or special act, or regulations adopted by any state agency, the terms of such agreement or arbitration award shall prevail; provided if participation of any employees in a retirement system is effected by such agreement or arbitration award, the effective date of participation in said system, notwithstanding any contrary provision in such agreement or arbitration award, shall be the first day of the third month following the month in which a certified copy of such agreement or arbitration award is received by the Retirement Commission or such later date as may be specified in the agreement or arbitration award.\n\n(2) For any agreement or arbitration award approved before, on or after July 31, 2020, in accordance with the provisions of sections 5-270 to 5-280 , inclusive, on matters appropriate to collective bargaining, as defined in said sections, where any provision in such agreement or award pertaining to the disclosure of disciplinary matters or alleged misconduct would prevent the disclosure of documents required to be disclosed under the provisions of the Freedom of Information Act, as defined in section 1-200 , the provisions of the Freedom of Information Act shall prevail. The provisions of this subdivision shall not be construed to diminish a bargaining agent's access to information pursuant to state law.\n\n(f) (1) Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, collective bargaining negotiations concerning changes to the state employees retirement system to be effective on and after July 1, 1988, and collective bargaining negotiations concerning health and welfare benefits to be effective on and after July 1, 1994, shall be conducted between the employer and a coalition committee which represents all state employees who are members of any designated employee organization. (2) The provisions of subdivision (1) of this subsection shall not be construed to prevent the employer and any designated employee organization from bargaining directly with each other on matters related to the state employees retirement system and health and welfare benefits whenever the parties jointly agree that such matters are unique to the particular bargaining unit. (3) The provisions of subdivision (1) of this subsection shall not be construed to prevent the employer and representatives of employee organizations from dealing with any state-wide issue using the procedure established in said subdivision.\n\n(g) (1) Nonmandatory subjects of bargaining shall not be subject to the impasse procedures of section 5-276a . In the case of higher education teaching faculty, the arbitrator shall not make a decision involving academic policy unless it affects the wages, hours or conditions of employment of such faculty. Any arbitration award issued on such matters shall be unenforceable. (2) Unless mutually agreed to by the parties, the impasse procedures of section 5-276a shall not be invoked during the pendency before the State Board of Labor Relations of any scope of bargaining question arising from the parties' negotiations. Any such question shall take precedence over all other matters pending before said board."
