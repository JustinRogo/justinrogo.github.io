The State Librarian shall send a copy of such order to the chief administrative officers of the town or towns comprising the district, the Probate Court Administrator and the judge of the probate district. The order shall specify the time within which the order shall be complied with. In setting such time for compliance, the State Librarian shall take into consideration the availability of facilities or equipment or the need for the construction or purchase thereof. The State Librarian may cause the enforcement of any such order by application to the Superior Court, or to any judge thereof if said court is not then sitting, to issue an appropriate decree or process, which application shall be brought and the proceedings thereon conducted by the Attorney General.\n\n(c) All fire-resistant rooms or vaults and all safes for the safekeeping of any such public records shall conform to regulations adopted by the Public Records Administrator, in accordance with chapter 54, and shall be furnished with fittings of a noncombustible nature."

If a judge of probate of a high volume court leaves office during a calendar year, or if a judge of probate of a high volume court assumes office and serves during a portion of the calendar year, the minimum net compensation provided in this section shall be prorated in accordance with the number of days served during the calendar year as the numerator, and three hundred sixty-five as the denominator.

The amount of assessment payable to the State Treasurer under this section shall be reduced by the amount necessary to provide to the judge the minimum compensation to which such judge is entitled under this section, and the estimates of annual net income required in subsections (e) and (f) of this section may be reduced accordingly. Minimum compensation as provided in this section shall only be payable if all ordinary and necessary expenses of the court are paid.",

              "(m) Compensation from January 1, 2011, to January 4, 2011. Notwithstanding the provisions of this section, the compensation of each probate judge in office during the period from January 1, 2011 to January 4, 2011, inclusive, shall be calculated by multiplying the judge's allowable compensation for calendar year 2010, as determined under the provisions of this section, by a fraction with the number of days served during such period as the numerator, and three hundred sixty-five as the denominator."

(1) As used in this subsection and subsections (c) to (i), inclusive, of this section, for any calendar year, the term “actual expenses incurred in connection therewith” may include as an allowable deduction the amount of any net operating loss for a prior calendar year as provided in this section. (2) The term “net operating loss” means the excess of itemized costs and expenses of office allowed by this section over the gross income. A net operating loss may be deducted in the calendar year following the year in which the net operating loss occurred, but (A) if the net income of such subsequent year is not sufficient to pay all of such net operating loss, then the balance of such net operating loss may be deducted in the second calendar year following such net operating loss; and (B) if the net income of such second calendar year is not sufficient to pay all of the remaining net operating loss, then the balance of such net operating loss may be deducted in the third calendar year following such net operating loss. In no event shall any such net operating loss or part thereof be deductible for any report beyond the third calendar year in which it occurred.\n\n(k) Compensation of judges in high volume courts. Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (c) of this section concerning percentage payments, a judge of probate who is the judge in a court of probate designated as a high volume court shall be permitted to retain as net compensation, before the payment of any amounts due under sections 45a-34 to 45a-54 , inclusive, and section 45a-75 , the sum which shall be the greater of (1) the net compensation resulting from the application of the percentages in subsection (c) of this section or (2) the compensation earned after payment of actual expenses of the office not to exceed seventy-five per cent of the amount of the salary of a Superior Court judge as determined in accordance with subsection (a) of section 51-47 as determined on July first of the calendar year for which the assessments are being paid pursuant to this section. If a judge of probate of a high volume court leaves office during a calendar year, or if a judge of probate of a high volume court assumes office and serves during a portion of the calendar year, the minimum net compensation provided in this section shall be prorated in accordance with the number of days served during the calendar year as the numerator, and three hundred sixty-five as the denominator. For the purposes of this subsection, “high volume court” means a court of probate which serves a district having an estimated population of seventy thousand or more persons as reported in the State Register and Manual for the calendar year immediately preceding (A) the year for which the judge was elected, (B) the year in which such judge was elected, or (C) any year of the term of office of such judge. The amount of assessment payable to the State Treasurer under this section shall be reduced by the amount necessary to provide to the judge the minimum compensation to which such judge is entitled under this section, and the estimates of annual net income required in subsections (e) and (f) of this section may be reduced accordingly. Minimum compensation as provided in this section shall only be payable if all ordinary and necessary expenses of the court are paid.\n\n(l) Applicability. This section applies only to income received by the courts of probate prior to January 5, 2011, except that payments made under section 45a-93 to a judge who leaves office or dies while in office shall be subject to the assessment under subsection (c) of this section regardless of when such payments are made.\n\n(m) Compensation from January 1, 2011, to January 4, 2011. Notwithstanding the provisions of this section, the compensation of each probate judge in office during the period from January 1, 2011 to January 4, 2011, inclusive, shall be calculated by multiplying the judge's allowable compensation for calendar year 2010, as determined under the provisions of this section, by a fraction with the number of days served during such period as the numerator, and three hundred sixty-five as the denominator."

            "text": "(a) As used in this section: (1) “Bona fide purchaser” means a party who takes a conveyance of real property in good faith and pays valuable consideration, without actual, implied or constructive notice that (A) a holder or former holder of a title interest in the real property died on or after January 1, 2015, while continuing to hold an interest in the real property at the time of death, or (B) a former holder of a title interest in the real property died on or after January 1, 2015, after making a lifetime transfer of an interest in the real property to a trustee of a revocable trust who continued to hold the interest at the time of the former holder's death; and (2) “qualified encumbrancer” means a party who places a burden, charge or lien on real property, in good faith, without actual, implied or constructive notice that (A) a holder or former holder of a title interest in the real property died on or after January 1, 2015, while continuing to hold an interest in the real property at the time of death, or (B) a former holder of a title interest in the real property died on or after January 1, 2015, after making a lifetime transfer of an interest in the real property to a trustee of a revocable trust who continued to hold the interest at the time of the former holder's death.\n\n(b) The fees imposed under subsections (b) and (c) of section 45a-107 shall be a lien in favor of the state of Connecticut upon any real property located in this state that is included in the basis for fees of the estate of a deceased person, from the due date until paid, with interest that may accrue in addition thereto, except that such lien shall not be valid as against any bona fide purchaser or qualified encumbrancer until notice of such lien is filed or recorded in the town clerk's office or place where mortgages, liens and conveyances of such property are required by statute to be filed or recorded.\n\n(c) The Probate Court for the district in which the decedent resided on the date of his or her death or, if the decedent died a nonresident of this state, for the district within which real estate or tangible personal property of the decedent is situated, shall issue a certificate of release of lien for any such real property not later than ten days after receipt of payment in full of such fee and interest thereon. The court may issue a certificate of release of lien for any such real property, or portion thereof, if the court finds that the fee and interest thereon has not been fully paid but that payment is adequately assured. A certificate of release of lien may be recorded in the office of the town clerk within which such real property is situated, and such certificate shall be conclusive proof that the fees have been paid and such lien discharged.\n\n(d) (1) A person having a title interest in real property subject to a lien for probate fees under this section may petition the Probate Court for a release of such lien if: (A) Such lien arises out of a decedent's retained life use or survivorship interest in the property; (B) the decedent died more than ten years prior to the date of filing the petition; (C) no proceeding for the settlement of the decedent's estate has been commenced in a Probate Court of this state; (D) no Connecticut estate or succession tax return for the decedent's estate has been filed with the Probate Court or Department of Revenue Services; (E) no Connecticut estate tax has been assessed by the Department of Revenue Services; and (F) based on the value of all known property and taxable gifts, no Connecticut estate tax could be assessed in connection with the decedent's estate. The petition shall be filed with the Probate Court for the district in which the decedent was domiciled at death or last resided or, if the decedent died a nonresident of this state, for the district within which the real estate is situated.\n\n(2) The petition for release of lien shall be accompanied by an affidavit or affidavits of the petitioner or the petitioner's attorney. The affidavits shall include the following: (A) A statement that the petitioner did not receive the title interest from the decedent as its immediate successor in interest in the chain of title or as a devise or distribution from the decedent's estate; (B) a statement that the affiant does not possess the information required to file a complete Connecticut estate tax return; (C) evidence that demonstrates a diligent search was made to locate the decedent's heirs, beneficiaries and transferees and a statement that any heirs, beneficiaries or transferees who were located failed or refused to file a Connecticut estate tax return; and (D) a recitation of facts known to the affiant regarding the requirements of this section. Any affidavits submitted by the petitioner's attorney shall be made on the basis of the attorney's own knowledge and shall not be construed to be submitted on behalf of the attorney's client.\n\n(3) Except as provided in subdivision (2) of this subsection, the petitioner shall submit an estate tax return, reporting the value of the real property that is the subject of the petition for release of lien and, to the best of the petitioner's knowledge, the value of all other property of the decedent at the time of death and taxable gifts made by the decedent on or after January 1, 2005.\n\n(4) Upon receipt of the petition, any affidavits and estate tax return, the Probate Court shall determine whether the petition meets the requirements of this subsection. The Probate Court may act on the petition with or without hearing. If the Probate Court determines that the petition meets the requirements of this subsection, the court shall calculate the probate fees on the decedent's estate based on the value of all known property and taxable gifts reported on the estate tax return, together with any applicable interest, and shall issue an invoice for the fees and interest to the petitioner.\n\n(5) The petitioner shall pay to the Probate Court the applicable probate fees and interest.\n\n(6) Not later than ten days after receipt of all applicable probate fees and interest thereon, the Probate Court shall issue certificates of release of the lien for probate fees, as applicable.\n\n(7) Any person petitioning for a release of lien under this section shall include in the petition, to the best of the petitioner's knowledge, all known real property to which the lien applies. A release of lien obtained pursuant to this section shall apply only to the real property reported on the estate tax return. Any other real property interest of the decedent shall continue to be subject to all applicable liens.\n\n(8) If the Probate Court receives an estate tax return for the decedent's estate and payment of all applicable probate fees and interest thereon after issuance of a certificate of release of a probate fee lien under this section, the court shall, on request of the petitioner, refund the probate fees paid by the petitioner under subdivision (4) of this subsection. The petitioner shall not be entitled to a refund of any interest."

No judge or magistrate may appoint a guardian ad litem for a petitioner under section 45a-705a .\n\n(3) No judge or magistrate may appoint a guardian ad litem for a conserved person in a proceeding under section 17a-543 or 17a-543a or sections 45a-644 to 45a-663 , inclusive, unless (A) the judge or magistrate makes a specific finding of a need to appoint a guardian ad litem for a specific purpose or to answer specific questions to assist the judge or magistrate in making a determination, or (B) the conserved person's attorney is unable to ascertain the preferences of the person, including preferences previously expressed by the person. Prior to appointing a guardian ad litem for a person under subparagraph (B) of this subdivision, the judge or magistrate may question the person to determine the person's preferences or inability to express such preferences.

The court shall cause notice of the hearing on the account to be given in such manner and to such parties as it directs.\n\n(h) In any action under this section, the Probate Court shall have, in addition to powers pursuant to this section, all the powers available to a judge of the Superior Court at law and in equity pertaining to matters under this section."

Superior Court on appeal from probate sits as, and has no greater power than, a Court of Probate. 148 C. 642; 153 C. 603, 614. Superior Court acts as a Court of Probate, exercising a special and limited statutory jurisdiction rather than its constitutional jurisdiction; it cannot by exercise of general equity powers relieve plaintiff from effect of late filing of appeal under Sec. 45-289. 150 C. 563. Allegations that plaintiff is nephew, former ward and prospective heir of and “responsible for” alleged incompetent's care held insufficient to establish aggrievement within meaning of statute; there is no allegation his rights were adversely affected by appointment of conservator of property of incompetent. 154 C. 247. Appeal erased for want of jurisdiction where plaintiff had not shown himself to be an aggrieved person; mere allegation that plaintiff is aggrieved without supporting factual allegations is not sufficient and allegation that he is only child of incompetent does not bestow on him a real interest in proceedings. 156 C. 625. Review of Probate Court may not include evidence of matters not in existence at date of Probate Court hearing. 157 C. 576.

(2) The term “settlor” means the creator of an inter vivos trust, whether called “settlor”, “grantor”, “donor”, or “trustor” in the instrument. (3) The terms “will” and “trust instrument” include, respectively, codicils to a will and amendments to a trust as the context may require. (4) “QTIP” means qualified terminable interest property as defined under Section 2056(b)(7)(B) of the federal Internal Revenue Code of 1986, or any subsequent corresponding internal revenue code of the United States, as from time to time amended.",
              "(b) Use of terminology. In all cases, the singular includes the plural of said terms and vice versa. Reference to any person by use of the neuter term “it” includes masculine and feminine and vice versa.",
              "(c) Incorporation of certain powers by reference in will or trust instrument. By an expressed intention of the testator or settlor so to do contained in a will or in an instrument in writing whereby a trust estate is created inter vivos, any one or more or all of the powers or any portion thereof enumerated in section 45a-234 , as they exist at the time of the signing of a will by the testator or at the time of the signing by the first settlor who signs a trust instrument, may be, by appropriate reference made thereto, incorporated in such will or other instrument, with the same effect as though such language were set forth verbatim in such will or other instrument. If a codicil or amendment to a trust instrument has been executed, the incorporated powers contained in such will or other instrument shall remain unchanged unless modified or otherwise altered by such codicil or amendment. Incorporation of one or more or all of the powers contained in said section by reference to said section shall be in addition to and not in limitation of other powers in the will or other instrument and of the common law powers or other statutory powers of the fiduciary. Any one or more or all of the additional powers or any portions thereof enumerated in section 45a-235 also may be incorporated by reference as therein provided but only to the extent they are individually referred to in such will or other instrument. In the event of a conflict between one or more of the powers contained in sections 45a-234 and 45a-235 and the express terms of the will or other instrument, the terms of such will or other instrument shall govern. In the event of a conflict between one or more of the powers contained in sections 45a-234 and 45a-235 , and any other provision of the general statutes, the power or powers contained in sections 45a-234 and 45a-235 shall govern.",
              "(d) Limitation of power. No discretionary power or authority conferred upon a fiduciary as provided in sections 45a-233 to 45a-236 , inclusive, may be exercised by such fiduciary in such a manner as, in the aggregate, to deprive the trust or the estate involved of an otherwise available tax exemption, deduction or credit, expressly including the marital and orphans deductions and the deduction for transfers for public, charitable and religious uses, except as otherwise prescribed by the testator or settlor, or operate to attract or impose a tax upon a settlor or estate of a testator or upon any other person as owner of any portion of the trust or estate involved. Notwithstanding any provisions contained in or incorporated by reference into a will or trust instrument, no person shall have a power to make any equitable adjustments affecting any qualified terminable interest property or a QTIP trust. For the purposes of this subsection, “equitable adjustments” means adjustments to trust corpus or income or both which involve a reallocation of assets from the account of one beneficiary to that of another to compensate for disproportionate sharing of a tax burden resulting from a tax election. The exercise of a power in violation of the restriction contained in this subsection shall render the action by the fiduciary or any other person with regard to that violation void. “Tax” means a federal, state, whether that of Connecticut, another state or territory of the United States, the District of Columbia or the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, local, municipal or foreign, whether national, provincial, state, local or municipal, income, gift, estate, generation-skipping, inheritance, succession, accessions or other death tax, duty or excise imposed on the transfer of property at death or by gift. “Marital deduction” and “deduction for transfers for public, charitable and religious uses” have the same meanings and applications as exist under the federal Internal Revenue Code in effect at the death of the testator or at the time a trust becomes irrevocable, as the case may be. The definition of tax in this subsection shall be deemed to be the definition as it existed in this subsection on and after January 1, 1970, and in subsection (b) of section 45-100a insofar as said section 45-100a applies to any instrument in which it was incorporated from January 1, 1967, to December 31, 1969, inclusive.",
              "(e) Construction of other types of instruments. Nothing herein shall be construed to prevent the incorporation of the powers enumerated in section 45a-234 or 45a-235 in any other kind of instrument or agreement."

As used in sections 45a-233 to 45a-236 , inclusive, (1) the term “fiduciary” means the one or more executors or administrators c.t.a. or administrators c.t.a., d.b.n. of the estate of a decedent, or the one or more trustees of a testamentary or inter vivos trust estate, or any successor or successors to the original fiduciary, or any substitute, or any ancillary fiduciary, whether corporate or individual and whether or not specifically named in the will or trust instrument, and includes the terms “cofiduciary”, “coexecutor” and “cotrustee”. (2) The term “settlor” means the creator of an inter vivos trust, whether called “settlor”, “grantor”, “donor”, or “trustor” in the instrument. (3) The terms “will” and “trust instrument” include, respectively, codicils to a will and amendments to a trust as the context may require. (4) “QTIP” means qualified terminable interest property as defined under Section 2056(b)(7)(B) of the federal Internal Revenue Code of 1986, or any subsequent corresponding internal revenue code of the United States, as from time to time amended.\n\n(b) Use of terminology. In all cases, the singular includes the plural of said terms and vice versa. Reference to any person by use of the neuter term “it” includes masculine and feminine and vice versa.\n\n(c) Incorporation of certain powers by reference in will or trust instrument. By an expressed intention of the testator or settlor so to do contained in a will or in an instrument in writing whereby a trust estate is created inter vivos, any one or more or all of the powers or any portion thereof enumerated in section 45a-234 , as they exist at the time of the signing of a will by the testator or at the time of the signing by the first settlor who signs a trust instrument, may be, by appropriate reference made thereto, incorporated in such will or other instrument, with the same effect as though such language were set forth verbatim in such will or other instrument. If a codicil or amendment to a trust instrument has been executed, the incorporated powers contained in such will or other instrument shall remain unchanged unless modified or otherwise altered by such codicil or amendment. Incorporation of one or more or all of the powers contained in said section by reference to said section shall be in addition to and not in limitation of other powers in the will or other instrument and of the common law powers or other statutory powers of the fiduciary. Any one or more or all of the additional powers or any portions thereof enumerated in section 45a-235 also may be incorporated by reference as therein provided but only to the extent they are individually referred to in such will or other instrument. In the event of a conflict between one or more of the powers contained in sections 45a-234 and 45a-235 and the express terms of the will or other instrument, the terms of such will or other instrument shall govern. In the event of a conflict between one or more of the powers contained in sections 45a-234 and 45a-235 , and any other provision of the general statutes, the power or powers contained in sections 45a-234 and 45a-235 shall govern.\n\n(d) Limitation of power. No discretionary power or authority conferred upon a fiduciary as provided in sections 45a-233 to 45a-236 , inclusive, may be exercised by such fiduciary in such a manner as, in the aggregate, to deprive the trust or the estate involved of an otherwise available tax exemption, deduction or credit, expressly including the marital and orphans deductions and the deduction for transfers for public, charitable and religious uses, except as otherwise prescribed by the testator or settlor, or operate to attract or impose a tax upon a settlor or estate of a testator or upon any other person as owner of any portion of the trust or estate involved. Notwithstanding any provisions contained in or incorporated by reference into a will or trust instrument, no person shall have a power to make any equitable adjustments affecting any qualified terminable interest property or a QTIP trust. For the purposes of this subsection, “equitable adjustments” means adjustments to trust corpus or income or both which involve a reallocation of assets from the account of one beneficiary to that of another to compensate for disproportionate sharing of a tax burden resulting from a tax election. The exercise of a power in violation of the restriction contained in this subsection shall render the action by the fiduciary or any other person with regard to that violation void. “Tax” means a federal, state, whether that of Connecticut, another state or territory of the United States, the District of Columbia or the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, local, municipal or foreign, whether national, provincial, state, local or municipal, income, gift, estate, generation-skipping, inheritance, succession, accessions or other death tax, duty or excise imposed on the transfer of property at death or by gift. “Marital deduction” and “deduction for transfers for public, charitable and religious uses” have the same meanings and applications as exist under the federal Internal Revenue Code in effect at the death of the testator or at the time a trust becomes irrevocable, as the case may be. The definition of tax in this subsection shall be deemed to be the definition as it existed in this subsection on and after January 1, 1970, and in subsection (b) of section 45-100a insofar as said section 45-100a applies to any instrument in which it was incorporated from January 1, 1967, to December 31, 1969, inclusive.\n\n(e) Construction of other types of instruments. Nothing herein shall be construed to prevent the incorporation of the powers enumerated in section 45a-234 or 45a-235 in any other kind of instrument or agreement."

              "(1) Retain Original Property. To retain for such time as the fiduciary shall deem advisable any property, real, personal or mixed, which the fiduciary may receive, even though the retention of such property by reason of its character, amount, proportion to the total estate or otherwise would not be appropriate for the fiduciary apart from this provision. The fiduciary shall not retain non-income-producing property in a trust intended to qualify for the marital deduction without the consent of the life beneficiary of such trust or the life beneficiary's legal representative, including the life beneficiary's guardian or conservator.",

No one dealing with the fiduciary, or with any real, personal or mixed property which is or was estate or trust property, shall be bound to ascertain or inquire as to the existence or occurrence of any event or purpose in or for which a sale is herein authorized or directed or otherwise as to the purpose or regularity of any acts of the fiduciary purporting to be done in pursuance of any other provisions or powers herein incorporated or granted.",

              "(6) Pay Taxes and Expenses. To pay taxes; to pay calls, assessments and any other sums chargeable or accruing against or on account of shares of stock, debentures or other corporate securities in the hands of a fiduciary, whenever such payment may be legally enforceable against the fiduciary or any property of the estate or trust, or if the fiduciary deems payment expedient and for the best interests of the estate or trust; to pay for repairs and other expenses incurred in the management, collection, care, administration and protection of the trust or estate including fiduciary compensation and attorneys' fees.",

              "(10) Register in Name of Nominee. To hold any investment in the name of a nominee or in any form in which title will pass by delivery, but the fiduciary shall be liable for any act of the nominee in connection with the investment so held.

A fiduciary or a fiduciary's employee who is a director of any corporation, more than nineteen per cent of whose stock is held by the estate or any trust, may use estate or trust assets to purchase and pay premiums on insurance to indemnify himself or herself from liability resulting from acting with conflicting interests and from other acts in his or her capacity as a director.",
              "(17) Collect. To collect, receive and give receipts for rents, issues, profits, and income of an estate or trust.",

No beneficiary serving as a cofiduciary and no settlor serving as a fiduciary or cofiduciary may participate in any decision as to claims between him and the estate or trust.

If investment counsel is selected, which at the time of selection has a reputation in its community for competence and fair dealing, its selection and retention shall be considered as having been made with due care, provided the fiduciary continues to retain such counsel only so long as such counsel maintains such reputation. Under such circumstances, the fiduciary shall have no investment responsibility whatever and may act without independent investigation upon the recommendations of any such person, without liability for any neglect, omission, misconduct, or default of such person.",

              "(22) Pay to or for Minors or Incompetent Persons. To make payments in money or in property, to or for a minor or incompetent person in any one or more of the following ways: (A) To such minor or incompetent person directly, if the fiduciary in its sole and absolute discretion deems such payment advisable; (B) to apply directly in payment for the support, maintenance, education, and medical, surgical, hospital, or other institutional care of such minor or incompetent person; (C) to the legal or natural guardian of such minor or conservator of such incompetent person; (D) to any other person, whether or not appointed guardian of the person or conservator by any court, who shall, in fact have the care and custody of the person of such minor or incompetent person.

Any will which has been denied probate or establishment by judgment or decree of a competent court in the testator's domicile may not be proved in this state except where such denial of probate or establishment is for a cause which is not grounds for rejection of a will of a testator domiciled in this state. Except as otherwise provided in this section, the laws of this state relating to proof and admission of wills to probate for domiciliary testators shall apply to proceedings under this section.\n\n(c) Whenever a testator of a will which is proved in this state pursuant to this section expressly provided in his will that he elects to have the administration and disposition of his estate governed by the laws of this state, then the validity, effect and interpretation of such will, and the administration and disposition of such estate, wherever situated, including rights of creditors and rights of inheritance, shall be determined by the laws of this state in the same manner as if such testator had been domiciled in this state at the time of his death, except as otherwise provided in this section. The rights of persons who are creditors of the testator or of his estate or who may possess or claim rights of inheritance to or elections against the testator's estate pursuant to the laws of the jurisdiction in which the testator was domiciled at the time of his death shall be governed by and subject to the laws of such jurisdiction as to any real or tangible property situated in such jurisdiction or as to any bank accounts which are maintained or other intangible property of the testator the evidences of which are situated in such jurisdiction at the time of the testator's death. Any proceeding pursuant to this subsection shall not be deemed to impair or otherwise adversely affect the claim of any other state or any possession of the United States, for inheritance, succession, estate or other death taxes which may be due and payable by reason of the testator's death.\n\n(d) All property of a testator whose will is proved under this section shall be subject to the laws of this state relating to the taxation of inheritances and successions, except that such laws shall not be applied on the basis that the testator was a domiciliary of this state unless there is a finding that such person was domiciled in this state as provided in section 45a-309 .\n\n(e) In proceedings in the settlement of estates under this section, for the purpose of computing the costs of the court of probate under section 45a-107 , the testator shall be deemed to have been domiciled in this state, unless the court of probate determines that the proceedings in this state are ancillary to proceedings in the state of the testator's domicile."

The finding by the court that such estate is not more than sufficient to pay the expenses of administration, the funeral and last sickness shall be sufficient cause to dispense with such notice.\n\n(c) To whom letters of administration granted. (1) Upon hearing as required by this section, the court of probate having jurisdiction shall grant administration of the intestate decedent's estate to any one or more persons or their designees appointed in the following order, provided such person or persons are entitled to share in the estate of the decedent: (A) The surviving spouse, (B) any child of the decedent or any guardian of such child as the court shall determine, (C) any grandchild of the decedent or any guardian of such grandchild as the court shall determine, (D) the decedent's parents, (E) any brother or sister of the decedent, (F) the next of kin entitled to share in the estate, or, on their refusal, incapacity or failure to give bond or upon the objection of any heir or creditor to such appointment found reasonable by the court, to any other person whom the court deems proper.\n\n(2) If the intestate decedent lived out of the state leaving property within the state, the court of probate having jurisdiction shall, upon notice and hearing as required by this section, grant administration to such person as the court deems proper.\n\n(d) Bond required of administrator. The court, upon granting any administration, shall take a probate bond from the administrator or any successor administrator appointed by the Court of Probate.\n\nSee Sec. 12-358 re reports to Revenue Services Commissioner by clerks of probate courts and re certified copies of wills and papers.\n\nSee Sec. 12-365 re administration on taxable transfer.\n\nSee Sec. 52-60 re appointment of judge of probate as attorney for nonresident fiduciary."

For the purposes of this subdivision, an interested person may bring an action in the Superior Court for a determination, by a preponderance of the evidence, that an heir, devisee, legatee or beneficiary of the deceased victim who has predeceased the interested person would have been adjudged guilty or found not guilty by reason of mental disease or defect, either as the principal or accessory, under section 53a-54a , 53a-54b , 53a-54c , 53a-54d , 53a-55 , 53a-55a , 53a-56 , 53a-56a , 53a-122 , 53a-123 or 53a-321 , had the heir, devisee, legatee or beneficiary survived.\n\n(2) With respect to inheritance under the will of the deceased victim, or rights to property as heir, devisee, legatee or beneficiary of the deceased victim, the person whose participation in the estate of another or whose right to property as such heir, devisee, legatee or beneficiary is so prevented under the provisions of this section shall be considered to have predeceased the deceased victim.\n\n(3) With respect to real property owned in joint tenancy with rights of survivorship with the deceased victim, such final adjudication as guilty or finding of not guilty by reason of mental disease or defect shall be a severance of the joint tenancy and shall convert the joint tenancy into a tenancy in common as to the deceased victim and the person so adjudged or found, but not as to any remaining joint tenant or tenants. Such severance shall be effective as of the time such adjudication or finding becomes final. When such jointly owned property is real property, a certified copy of the final adjudication as guilty or finding of not guilty by reason of mental disease or defect shall be recorded by the fiduciary of the deceased victim's estate, or may be recorded by any other interested party in the land records of the town where such real property is situated.\n\n(4) With respect to personal property owned in joint tenancy with rights of survivorship with the deceased victim, such final adjudication as guilty or finding of not guilty by reason of mental disease or defect shall convert the personal property to property owned solely by the deceased victim except to the extent that the adjudged guilty person or person found not guilty by reason of mental disease or defect can prove by a preponderance of the evidence such person's financial contributions to such property.\n\n(b) In all other cases where a defendant has been convicted under section 53a-54a , 53a-54b , 53a-54c , 53a-54d , 53a-55 , 53a-55a , 53a-56 , 53a-56a , 53a-122 , 53a-123 or 53a-321 , the right of such adjudged guilty person or person found not guilty by reason of mental disease or defect to inherit or take any part of the estate of the deceased victim or to inherit or take any estate as to which the death of such deceased victim terminated an intermediate estate, or hastened the time of enjoyment, or to take any property as beneficiary or survivor of the deceased victim shall be determined by the common law, including equity.\n\n(c) (1) A named beneficiary of a life insurance policy or annuity who intentionally causes the death of the person upon whose life the policy is issued or the annuitant, or who is finally adjudged guilty under section 53a-122 , 53a-123 or 53a-321 , is not entitled to any benefit under the policy or annuity, and the policy or annuity becomes payable as though such beneficiary had predeceased the deceased victim.\n\n(2) (A) A conviction or a finding of not guilty by reason of mental disease or defect under section 53a-54a , 53a-54b , 53a-54c , 53a-54d , 53a-55 , 53a-55a , 53a-56 , 53a-56a , 53a-122 , 53a-123 or 53a-321 , or a determination pursuant to subparagraph (B) of this subdivision that a named beneficiary would have been found guilty under any of said sections had the named beneficiary survived, or would have been found not guilty by reason of mental disease or defect had the named beneficiary survived, shall be conclusive for the purposes of this subsection.\n\n(B) For the purposes of this subsection, an interested person may bring an action in the Superior Court for a determination, by a preponderance of the evidence, that a named beneficiary who has predeceased the interested person would have been found guilty under section 53a-54a , 53a-54b , 53a-54c , 53a-54d , 53a-55 , 53a-55a , 53a-56 , 53a-56a , 53a-122 , 53a-123 or 53a-321 , or would have been found not guilty by reason of mental disease or defect under any of said sections, had the named beneficiary survived.\n\n(C) In the absence of such a conviction, finding or determination, the Superior Court may determine by the common law, including equity, whether the named beneficiary is entitled to any benefit under the policy or annuity.\n\n(D) In any proceeding brought under this subsection, the burden of proof shall be on the person challenging the eligibility of the named beneficiary for benefits under a life insurance policy or annuity.\n\n(3) Any insurance company that makes payment according to the terms of its policy or annuity is not liable for any additional payment by reason of this section unless the insurance company has received at its home office or principal address written notice of a claim under this section prior to such payment.\n\n(d) Notwithstanding the provisions of subsections (a) to (c), inclusive, of this section, the Superior Court may allow a defendant adjudged guilty under section 53a-122 , 53a-123 or 53a-321 , or found not guilty by reason of mental disease or defect under any of said sections, to petition a court in equity to override the prohibitions on inheritance or other benefit to the adjudged guilty person under such sections if the court shall determine that overriding such prohibitions would fulfill the intent of the deceased victim or that application of such prohibitions would be grossly inequitable under all of the circumstances, which could include, without limitation, restitution or other substantial benefit provided to the deceased victim during the deceased victim's lifetime or express forgiveness by the deceased victim. The burden of proof shall be on the petitioner."

The term does not include an item of income or expense that is due or accrued or net income that has been added or is required to be added to principal under the terms of the trust.\n\n(b) When a mandatory income interest ends, the trustee shall pay to a mandatory income beneficiary who survives that date, or the estate of a deceased mandatory income beneficiary whose death causes the interest to end, the beneficiary's share of the undistributed income that is not disposed of under the terms of the trust unless the beneficiary has an unqualified power to revoke more than five per cent of the trust immediately before the income interest ends. In the latter case, the undistributed income from the portion of the trust that may be revoked must be added to principal.\n\n(c) When a trustee's obligation to pay a fixed annuity or a fixed fraction of the value of the trust's assets ends, the trustee shall prorate the final payment if and to the extent required by applicable law to accomplish a purpose of the trust or its settlor relating to income, gift, estate or other tax requirements."

(ii) if the disclaimer is made by a fiduciary for such fiduciary alone but not on behalf of other or successor fiduciaries, then the disclaimed fiduciary power shall be treated, as to such disclaiming fiduciary, as if such fiduciary power never existed; however, such fiduciary power shall continue to be exercisable by any fiduciary who has not disclaimed such power and by all successor fiduciaries.\n\n(3) If a disclaimer is addressed to an interest disposed of by a particular provision of a will, then the interest disclaimed shall devolve pursuant to subdivisions (1) and (2) of subsection (e) of this section, but only for purposes of such provision, and such interest may devolve to or for the benefit of the disclaimant, or the person, estate, trust, corporation, partnership, limited liability company, foundation, or other entity on whose behalf the disclaimer is made, under other provisions of such will, by intestacy or otherwise.\n\n(4) Any future interest that takes effect in possession or enjoyment at or after the termination, whether by death or otherwise, of the interest disclaimed shall, unless otherwise provided in the will, take effect, (A) in the case of a disclaimer by or on behalf of a natural person, as if the disclaimant or the person on whose behalf the disclaimer is made had predeceased the deceased owner or the donee of the power, as the case may be, or (B) in the case of a disclaimer on behalf of a trust, estate, corporation, partnership, limited liability company, foundation, or other entity, as if the disposition to such entity were ineffective.\n\n(5) A disclaimer shall relate back for all purposes to the date of death of the deceased owner or of the donee of the power of appointment.\n\n(f) In a case in which the estate of a decedent receives a settlement in a wrongful death action and a beneficiary of the estate dies intestate within seven months of the prior decedent, and such beneficiary's estate receives some part of such settlement, subsection (d) of this section shall be waived, and the interest of the beneficiary may be disclaimed without being subject to a nine-month disclaimer period, provided such disclaimer is made on or before December 1, 1997."

If the disclaimed interest is deemed to have passed to more than one surviving joint tenant, such surviving joint tenants shall hold such disclaimed interest as tenants in common. If two or more joint tenants survive the deceased joint tenant, the joint tenancy interests they held prior to the death of the deceased joint tenant shall remain joint tenancy interests as to each other.

            "text": "(a) A grantee, donee, joint-tenant of personal property or real property, person succeeding to a disclaimed interest, beneficiary under a nontestamentary instrument, trustee, donee of a power of appointment granted by a nontestamentary instrument, or an appointee under a power of appointment exercised by a nontestamentary instrument or any other recipient of an interest may disclaim in whole or, except as provided in subsection (f) of this section, in part any interest under a nontestamentary instrument by delivering a written disclaimer in the manner hereinafter provided.\n\n(b) (1) A guardian or conservator of the estate of a minor or incapable person, an executor, administrator or other personal representative of the estate of a decedent, if such fiduciary is not authorized by will to disclaim, or a trustee under a will or nontestamentary trust instrument which does not authorize such trustee to disclaim, may, with approval of any probate court having jurisdiction under subdivision (3) of this subsection, disclaim on behalf of such minor, incapable person, decedent, decedent's estate, or trust, within the same time and in the same manner as could a capable person.\n\n(2) If the will under which an executor, administrator or other personal representative of the estate of a decedent or the will or trust instrument under which a trustee of a testamentary or nontestamentary trust is acting authorizes such fiduciary to disclaim and does not expressly require Probate Court approval of a disclaimer, such fiduciary may disclaim on behalf of such decedent, estate or trust within the same time and in the same manner as could a capable person and need not seek approval of the Probate Court for such disclaimer, provided such fiduciary may petition any probate court having jurisdiction under subdivision (3) of this subsection for authority to disclaim.\n\n(3) A guardian or conservator of the estate of a minor or incapable person, an executor, administrator or other personal representative of the estate of a decedent, or a trustee under a will or a nontestamentary trust instrument may file a petition requesting authority to disclaim an interest under a nontestamentary instrument in the probate court having jurisdiction over such disclaiming fiduciary, and if there is no such court in this state, in the Probate Court for any district, (A) where such disclaiming fiduciary, if not a natural person, has a place of business, (B) where the creator of the interest resided at the time of its creation, resided at the time of such creator's death or resides at the time of such petition, (C) where the settlor of the disclaiming trust resided at the time of its creation, resided at the time of such settlor's death or resides at the time of such petition, or (D) where the disclaiming fiduciary or any beneficiary of the disclaiming estate or trust resides. The Probate Court shall have jurisdiction over proceedings for authority to disclaim as provided for in this subdivision. A petition requesting authority to disclaim by a fiduciary of an estate or trust not otherwise subject to the jurisdiction of the Probate Court shall not subject such estate or trust or its fiduciary to the continuing jurisdiction of the Probate Court.\n\n(c) The disclaimer shall (1) describe the interest therein disclaimed, (2) be executed by the disclaimant in the manner provided for the execution of deeds of real property either by the laws of this state or by the laws of the place of execution, and (3) declare the disclaimer and the extent thereof.\n\n(d) A disclaimer under this section shall be effective if made in the following manner: (1) A disclaimer of a present interest shall be delivered not later than the date which is nine months after the later of (A) the effective date of the nontestamentary instrument, or (B) if the disclaimer is made by or on behalf of a natural person, the day on which such person attains the age of eighteen years or, if such person does not survive to the age of eighteen years, the day on which such person dies. (2) A disclaimer of a future interest shall be delivered not later than the date which is nine months after the later of (A) the event determining that the taker of the interest is finally ascertained and such interest is indefeasibly vested or (B) if the disclaimer is made by or on behalf of a natural person, the day on which such person attains the age of eighteen years or, if such person does not survive to the age of eighteen years, the day on which such person dies. (3) If the disclaimant, or the person on whose behalf the disclaimer is made, does not have actual knowledge of the existence of the interest, the disclaimer shall be delivered not later than the date which is nine months after the later of (A) the date on which the disclaimant, or the person on whose behalf the disclaimer is made, first has actual knowledge of the existence of the interest or (B) if the disclaimer is made by or on behalf of a natural person, the day on which such person attains the age of eighteen years or, if such person does not survive to the age of eighteen years, the day on which such person dies. (4) The disclaimer shall be delivered to the transferor of the interest, the transferor's legal representative or the holder of the legal title to the property to which such interest relates. (5) If an interest in real property is disclaimed, a copy of such disclaimer shall also be recorded in the office of the town clerk in which the real property is situated. As to such real property interest, such disclaimer shall not be effective against any person other than the disclaimant, the person on whose behalf such disclaimer is made or any person having actual knowledge of such disclaimer until the time of recording. For the purposes of this section, the effective date of a nontestamentary instrument is the date on which the maker no longer has power to revoke it or to transfer to the maker or another the entire legal and equitable ownership of the interest.\n\n(e) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (f) of this section, if a disclaimer is made pursuant to this section, the interest disclaimed shall devolve as follows:\n\n(1) If the nontestamentary instrument provides for another disposition in the event of a disclaimer, the interest disclaimed shall devolve as provided in the nontestamentary instrument in the event of a disclaimer.\n\n(2) If the nontestamentary instrument does not provide for another disposition in the event of a disclaimer, the interest disclaimed shall devolve as follows:\n\n(A) If the disclaimant is a natural person acting for himself or herself, the interest disclaimed shall devolve as if the disclaimant had died immediately before the effective date of such nontestamentary instrument.\n\n(B) If the disclaimant is acting on behalf of a natural person, as attorney-in-fact, guardian, conservator or other personal representative, the interest disclaimed shall devolve as if the person on whose behalf the disclaimer is made had died immediately before the effective date of such nontestamentary instrument.\n\n(C) If the disclaimant is an executor, administrator or other personal representative acting on behalf of a deceased person, the interest disclaimed shall devolve as if the deceased person on whose behalf the disclaimer is made had died immediately before the effective date of such nontestamentary instrument.\n\n(D) If the disclaimant is an executor, administrator or other personal representative acting on behalf of an estate, the interest disclaimed shall devolve as if the disposition to the estate were ineffective.\n\n(E) If the disclaimant is the trustee of a trust or is a corporation, partnership, limited liability company, foundation, or other entity, the disclaimed interest, other than an interest that is a fiduciary power, shall devolve as if the disposition to the trust or entity were ineffective.\n\n(F) If the disclaimant is a trustee and the interest disclaimed is a fiduciary power, the effect of such disclaimer shall be as follows: (i) If the disclaimer is made by all of the acting trustees for themselves and on behalf of all successor trustees, then the disclaimed fiduciary power shall be treated, for all current acting trustees and for all successor trustees, as if such fiduciary power never existed; (ii) if the disclaimer is made by a trustee for such trustee alone but not on behalf of other or successor trustees, then the disclaimed fiduciary power shall be treated, as to such disclaiming trustee, as if such fiduciary power never existed; however, such fiduciary power shall continue to be exercisable by any trustee who has not disclaimed such power and by all successor trustees.\n\n(3) If a disclaimer is addressed to an interest disposed of by a particular provision of a nontestamentary instrument, then the interest disclaimed shall devolve pursuant to subdivisions (1) and (2) of this subsection, but only for purposes of such provision, and such interest may devolve to or for the benefit of the disclaimant, or the person, estate, trust, corporation, partnership, limited liability company, foundation, or other entity on whose behalf the disclaimer is made, under other provisions of such nontestamentary instrument, by intestacy or otherwise.\n\n(4) Any future interest that takes effect in possession or enjoyment at or after the termination, whether by death or otherwise, of the interest disclaimed shall, unless otherwise provided in the nontestamentary instrument, take effect, (A) in the case of a disclaimer by or on behalf of a natural person, as if the disclaimant or the person on whose behalf the disclaimer is made had died immediately before the effective date of such nontestamentary instrument or, (B) in the case of a disclaimer on behalf of a trust, estate, corporation, partnership, limited liability company, foundation, or other entity, as if the disposition to such entity were ineffective.\n\n(5) A disclaimer shall relate back for all purposes to the effective date of the nontestamentary instrument.\n\n(f) The disclaimer of an interest in real property by a joint tenant following the death of another joint tenant shall have the same effect as if (1) before dying, the deceased joint tenant had severed his interest by conveyance to, and receipt of, reconveyance from, a stranger, (2) such severed interest of the deceased joint tenant, upon his death, had passed in equal shares to any nondisclaiming joint tenant or joint tenants, and (3) if there were no nondisclaiming joint tenants, as if such interest had passed as part of the estate of the deceased joint tenant. If the disclaimed interest is deemed to have passed to more than one surviving joint tenant, such surviving joint tenants shall hold such disclaimed interest as tenants in common. If two or more joint tenants survive the deceased joint tenant, the joint tenancy interests they held prior to the death of the deceased joint tenant shall remain joint tenancy interests as to each other. A partial disclaimer of an interest in real property by a joint tenant shall be void."

              "(a)(1) When application has been made for the removal of one or both parents as guardians or of any other guardian of the person of a minor child, or when an application has been made for the termination of the parental rights of any parties who may have parental rights with regard to any minor child, or when, in any proceeding the court has reasonable grounds to believe that any minor child has no guardian of his or her person, the court of probate in which the proceeding is pending may issue an order awarding temporary custody of the minor child to a person other than the parent or guardian, with or without the parent's or guardian's consent, but such order may only be issued in accordance with the provisions of this section. There shall be a rebuttable presumption that the awarding of temporary custody to a relative is in the best interests of such child or youth. This presumption may be rebutted by a preponderance of the evidence that such awarding of custody is not in the best interests of such child or youth. As used in this subsection and subsections (b) and (d) of this section, “relative” means a person related to the child by blood or marriage.",
              "(2) In any proceeding under this section, any relative of the minor child may make a motion to intervene and the court shall grant such motion except for good cause shown. Upon the granting of such motion, such relative may appear by counsel or in person.",
              "(b) In the case of a minor child in the custody of the parent or other guardian, no application for custody of such minor child may be granted ex parte, except in accordance with subdivision (2) of this subsection. In the case of a minor child in the custody of a person other than the parent or guardian, no application for custody may be granted ex parte, except in accordance with subdivisions (1) to (3), inclusive, of this subsection.",
              "(1) An application for immediate temporary custody shall be accompanied by an affidavit made by the custodian of such minor child under penalty of false statement, stating the circumstances under which such custody was obtained, the length of time the affiant has had custody and specific facts which would justify the conclusion that determination cannot await the hearing required by subsection (c) of this section. Upon such application, the court may grant immediate temporary custody to the affiant, a relative, or some other suitable person if the court finds that: (A) The minor child was not taken or kept from the parent, parents or guardian, and (B) there is a substantial likelihood that the minor child will be removed from the jurisdiction prior to a hearing under subsection (c) of this section, or (C) to return the minor child to the parent, parents or guardian would place the minor child in circumstances which would result in serious physical illness or injury, or the threat thereof, or imminent physical danger prior to a hearing under subsection (c) of this section.",
              "(2) In the case of a minor child who is hospitalized as a result of serious physical illness or serious physical injury, an application for immediate temporary custody shall contain a certificate signed by two physicians licensed to practice medicine in this state stating that (A) the minor child is in need of immediate medical or surgical treatment, the delay of which would be life threatening, (B) the parent, parents or guardian of the minor child refuses or is unable to consent to such treatment, and (C) determination of the need for temporary custody cannot await notice of hearing. Upon such application, the court may grant immediate temporary custody to a relative or some other suitable person if it finds that (i) a minor child has suffered from serious physical illness or serious physical injury and is in need of immediate medical or surgical treatment, (ii) the parent, parents or guardian refuses to consent to such treatment, and (iii) to delay such treatment would be life threatening.",
              "(3) If an order of temporary custody is issued ex parte, notice of the hearing required by subsection (c) of this section shall be given promptly, and the hearing shall be held not later than five business days after the date of such ex parte order of temporary custody, provided the respondent shall be entitled to continuance upon request. Upon the issuance of an order granting temporary custody of the minor child to the Commissioner of Children and Families, or not later than sixty days after the issuance of such order, the court shall make a determination whether the Department of Children and Families made reasonable efforts to keep the minor child with his or her parent, parents or guardian prior to the issuance of such order and, if such efforts were not made, whether such reasonable efforts were not possible, taking into consideration the minor child's best interests, including the minor child's health and safety. Upon issuance of an ex parte order of temporary custody, the court shall promptly notify the Commissioner of Children and Families, who shall cause an investigation to be made forthwith, in accordance with section 17a-101g , and shall present the commissioner's report to the court at the hearing on the application for temporary custody. The hearing on an ex parte order of temporary custody shall not be postponed, except with the consent of the respondent, or, if notice cannot be given as required by this section, a postponement may be ordered by the court for the purpose of a further order of notice.",
              "(c) Except as provided in subsection (b) of this section, upon receipt of an application for temporary custody under this section, the court shall promptly set the time and place for a hearing to be held on such application. The court shall order notice of the hearing on temporary custody to be given, at least five days prior to the date of the hearing, to the Commissioner of Children and Families by first class mail and to both parents and to the minor child, if over twelve years of age, by personal service or service at the parent's usual place of abode or the minor's usual place of abode, as the case may be, in accordance with section 52-50 , except that in lieu of personal service on, or service at the usual place of abode of, a parent or the father of a minor child born out of wedlock who is either an applicant or who signs under penalty of false statement a written waiver of such service on a form provided by the Probate Court Administrator, the court may order notice to be given by first class mail at least five days prior to the date of the hearing. If the whereabouts of the parents are unknown, or if such delivery cannot reasonably be effected, then notice shall be ordered to be given by publication. Such notice may be combined with the notice under section 45a-609 or with the notice required under section 45a-716 . If the parents are not residents of the state or are absent from the state, the court shall order notice to be given by first class mail at least five days prior to the date of the hearing. If the whereabouts of the parents are unknown, or if delivery cannot reasonably be effected, the court may order notice to be given by publication. Any notice by publication under this subsection shall be in a newspaper which has a circulation at the last-known place of residence of the parents. In either case, such notice shall be given at least five days prior to the date of the hearing, except in the case of notice of a hearing on immediate temporary custody under subsection (b) of this section. If the applicant alleges that the whereabouts of a respondent are unknown, such allegation shall be made under penalty of false statement and shall also state the last-known address of the respondent and the efforts which have been made by the applicant to obtain a current address. The applicant shall have the burden of ascertaining the names and addresses of all parties in interest and of proving to the satisfaction of the court that the applicant used all proper diligence to discover such names and addresses. Except in the case of newspaper notice, such notice shall include: (1) The time and place of the hearing, (2) a copy of the application for removal or application for termination of parental rights, (3) a copy of the motion for temporary custody, (4) any affidavit or verified petition filed with the motion for temporary custody, (5) any other documents filed by the applicant, (6) any other orders or notices made by the court of probate, and (7) any request for investigation by the Department of Children and Families or any other person or agency. Such notice shall also inform the respondent of the right to have an attorney represent the respondent and, if the respondent is unable to obtain or pay for an attorney, the respondent may request the court of probate to appoint an attorney to represent the respondent. Newspaper notice shall include such facts as the court may direct.",
              "(d) If, after hearing, the court finds by a fair preponderance of the evidence (1) that the parent or other guardian has performed acts of omission or commission as set forth in section 45a-610 , and (2) that, because of such acts, the minor child is suffering from serious physical illness or serious physical injury, or the immediate threat thereof, or is in immediate physical danger, so as to require that temporary custody be granted, the court may order the custody of the minor child to be given to one of the following, taking into consideration the standards set forth in section 45a-617 and subsection (a) of this section: (A) A relative of such minor child; (B) the Commissioner of Children and Families; (C) the board of managers of any child-caring institution or organization; (D) any children's home or similar institution licensed or approved by the Commissioner of Children and Families; or (E) any other person. The fact that an order of temporary custody may have been issued ex parte under subsection (b) of this section shall be of no weight in a hearing held under this subsection. The burden of proof shall remain upon the applicant to establish the applicant's case. The court may issue the order without taking into consideration the standards set forth in this section and section 45a-610 if the parent or other guardian consents to the temporary removal of the minor child, or the court finds that the minor child has no guardian of his or her person. Upon the issuance of an order giving custody of the minor child to the Commissioner of Children and Families, or not later than sixty days after the issuance of such order, the court shall make a determination whether the Department of Children and Families made reasonable efforts to keep the minor child with his or her parent, parents or guardian prior to the issuance of such order and, if such efforts were not made, whether such reasonable efforts were not possible, taking into consideration the minor child's best interests, including the minor child's health and safety.",
              "(e) Such order for temporary custody shall be effective until disposition of the application for removal of parents or guardians as guardian or for termination of parental rights or until a guardian is appointed for a minor child who has no guardian, unless modified or terminated by the court of probate. Any respondent, temporary custodian or attorney for the minor child may petition the court of probate issuing such order at any time for modification or revocation thereof, and such court shall set a hearing upon receipt of such petition in the same manner as subsection (c) of this section. If the court finds after such hearing that the conditions upon which it based its order for temporary custody no longer exist, and that the conditions set forth in subsection (b) of this section do not exist, then the order shall be revoked and the minor child shall be returned to the custody of the parent or guardian.",
              "(f) A copy of any order issued under this section shall be mailed immediately to the last-known address of the parent or other guardian from whose custody the minor child has been removed.",

            "text": "(a)(1) When application has been made for the removal of one or both parents as guardians or of any other guardian of the person of a minor child, or when an application has been made for the termination of the parental rights of any parties who may have parental rights with regard to any minor child, or when, in any proceeding the court has reasonable grounds to believe that any minor child has no guardian of his or her person, the court of probate in which the proceeding is pending may issue an order awarding temporary custody of the minor child to a person other than the parent or guardian, with or without the parent's or guardian's consent, but such order may only be issued in accordance with the provisions of this section. There shall be a rebuttable presumption that the awarding of temporary custody to a relative is in the best interests of such child or youth. This presumption may be rebutted by a preponderance of the evidence that such awarding of custody is not in the best interests of such child or youth. As used in this subsection and subsections (b) and (d) of this section, “relative” means a person related to the child by blood or marriage.\n\n(2) In any proceeding under this section, any relative of the minor child may make a motion to intervene and the court shall grant such motion except for good cause shown. Upon the granting of such motion, such relative may appear by counsel or in person.\n\n(b) In the case of a minor child in the custody of the parent or other guardian, no application for custody of such minor child may be granted ex parte, except in accordance with subdivision (2) of this subsection. In the case of a minor child in the custody of a person other than the parent or guardian, no application for custody may be granted ex parte, except in accordance with subdivisions (1) to (3), inclusive, of this subsection.\n\n(1) An application for immediate temporary custody shall be accompanied by an affidavit made by the custodian of such minor child under penalty of false statement, stating the circumstances under which such custody was obtained, the length of time the affiant has had custody and specific facts which would justify the conclusion that determination cannot await the hearing required by subsection (c) of this section. Upon such application, the court may grant immediate temporary custody to the affiant, a relative, or some other suitable person if the court finds that: (A) The minor child was not taken or kept from the parent, parents or guardian, and (B) there is a substantial likelihood that the minor child will be removed from the jurisdiction prior to a hearing under subsection (c) of this section, or (C) to return the minor child to the parent, parents or guardian would place the minor child in circumstances which would result in serious physical illness or injury, or the threat thereof, or imminent physical danger prior to a hearing under subsection (c) of this section.\n\n(2) In the case of a minor child who is hospitalized as a result of serious physical illness or serious physical injury, an application for immediate temporary custody shall contain a certificate signed by two physicians licensed to practice medicine in this state stating that (A) the minor child is in need of immediate medical or surgical treatment, the delay of which would be life threatening, (B) the parent, parents or guardian of the minor child refuses or is unable to consent to such treatment, and (C) determination of the need for temporary custody cannot await notice of hearing. Upon such application, the court may grant immediate temporary custody to a relative or some other suitable person if it finds that (i) a minor child has suffered from serious physical illness or serious physical injury and is in need of immediate medical or surgical treatment, (ii) the parent, parents or guardian refuses to consent to such treatment, and (iii) to delay such treatment would be life threatening.\n\n(3) If an order of temporary custody is issued ex parte, notice of the hearing required by subsection (c) of this section shall be given promptly, and the hearing shall be held not later than five business days after the date of such ex parte order of temporary custody, provided the respondent shall be entitled to continuance upon request. Upon the issuance of an order granting temporary custody of the minor child to the Commissioner of Children and Families, or not later than sixty days after the issuance of such order, the court shall make a determination whether the Department of Children and Families made reasonable efforts to keep the minor child with his or her parent, parents or guardian prior to the issuance of such order and, if such efforts were not made, whether such reasonable efforts were not possible, taking into consideration the minor child's best interests, including the minor child's health and safety. Upon issuance of an ex parte order of temporary custody, the court shall promptly notify the Commissioner of Children and Families, who shall cause an investigation to be made forthwith, in accordance with section 17a-101g , and shall present the commissioner's report to the court at the hearing on the application for temporary custody. The hearing on an ex parte order of temporary custody shall not be postponed, except with the consent of the respondent, or, if notice cannot be given as required by this section, a postponement may be ordered by the court for the purpose of a further order of notice.\n\n(c) Except as provided in subsection (b) of this section, upon receipt of an application for temporary custody under this section, the court shall promptly set the time and place for a hearing to be held on such application. The court shall order notice of the hearing on temporary custody to be given, at least five days prior to the date of the hearing, to the Commissioner of Children and Families by first class mail and to both parents and to the minor child, if over twelve years of age, by personal service or service at the parent's usual place of abode or the minor's usual place of abode, as the case may be, in accordance with section 52-50 , except that in lieu of personal service on, or service at the usual place of abode of, a parent or the father of a minor child born out of wedlock who is either an applicant or who signs under penalty of false statement a written waiver of such service on a form provided by the Probate Court Administrator, the court may order notice to be given by first class mail at least five days prior to the date of the hearing. If the whereabouts of the parents are unknown, or if such delivery cannot reasonably be effected, then notice shall be ordered to be given by publication. Such notice may be combined with the notice under section 45a-609 or with the notice required under section 45a-716 . If the parents are not residents of the state or are absent from the state, the court shall order notice to be given by first class mail at least five days prior to the date of the hearing. If the whereabouts of the parents are unknown, or if delivery cannot reasonably be effected, the court may order notice to be given by publication. Any notice by publication under this subsection shall be in a newspaper which has a circulation at the last-known place of residence of the parents. In either case, such notice shall be given at least five days prior to the date of the hearing, except in the case of notice of a hearing on immediate temporary custody under subsection (b) of this section. If the applicant alleges that the whereabouts of a respondent are unknown, such allegation shall be made under penalty of false statement and shall also state the last-known address of the respondent and the efforts which have been made by the applicant to obtain a current address. The applicant shall have the burden of ascertaining the names and addresses of all parties in interest and of proving to the satisfaction of the court that the applicant used all proper diligence to discover such names and addresses. Except in the case of newspaper notice, such notice shall include: (1) The time and place of the hearing, (2) a copy of the application for removal or application for termination of parental rights, (3) a copy of the motion for temporary custody, (4) any affidavit or verified petition filed with the motion for temporary custody, (5) any other documents filed by the applicant, (6) any other orders or notices made by the court of probate, and (7) any request for investigation by the Department of Children and Families or any other person or agency. Such notice shall also inform the respondent of the right to have an attorney represent the respondent and, if the respondent is unable to obtain or pay for an attorney, the respondent may request the court of probate to appoint an attorney to represent the respondent. Newspaper notice shall include such facts as the court may direct.\n\n(d) If, after hearing, the court finds by a fair preponderance of the evidence (1) that the parent or other guardian has performed acts of omission or commission as set forth in section 45a-610 , and (2) that, because of such acts, the minor child is suffering from serious physical illness or serious physical injury, or the immediate threat thereof, or is in immediate physical danger, so as to require that temporary custody be granted, the court may order the custody of the minor child to be given to one of the following, taking into consideration the standards set forth in section 45a-617 and subsection (a) of this section: (A) A relative of such minor child; (B) the Commissioner of Children and Families; (C) the board of managers of any child-caring institution or organization; (D) any children's home or similar institution licensed or approved by the Commissioner of Children and Families; or (E) any other person. The fact that an order of temporary custody may have been issued ex parte under subsection (b) of this section shall be of no weight in a hearing held under this subsection. The burden of proof shall remain upon the applicant to establish the applicant's case. The court may issue the order without taking into consideration the standards set forth in this section and section 45a-610 if the parent or other guardian consents to the temporary removal of the minor child, or the court finds that the minor child has no guardian of his or her person. Upon the issuance of an order giving custody of the minor child to the Commissioner of Children and Families, or not later than sixty days after the issuance of such order, the court shall make a determination whether the Department of Children and Families made reasonable efforts to keep the minor child with his or her parent, parents or guardian prior to the issuance of such order and, if such efforts were not made, whether such reasonable efforts were not possible, taking into consideration the minor child's best interests, including the minor child's health and safety.\n\n(e) Such order for temporary custody shall be effective until disposition of the application for removal of parents or guardians as guardian or for termination of parental rights or until a guardian is appointed for a minor child who has no guardian, unless modified or terminated by the court of probate. Any respondent, temporary custodian or attorney for the minor child may petition the court of probate issuing such order at any time for modification or revocation thereof, and such court shall set a hearing upon receipt of such petition in the same manner as subsection (c) of this section. If the court finds after such hearing that the conditions upon which it based its order for temporary custody no longer exist, and that the conditions set forth in subsection (b) of this section do not exist, then the order shall be revoked and the minor child shall be returned to the custody of the parent or guardian.\n\n(f) A copy of any order issued under this section shall be mailed immediately to the last-known address of the parent or other guardian from whose custody the minor child has been removed.\n\nSee Sec. 45a-242 re replacement of fiduciary."

The Probate Court shall cause notice of the hearing on the petition to be given by first class mail to each person listed in subsection (b) of section 45a-609 , and such hearing may be held at the same time as the hearing on the underlying petition for removal or appointment.

The petition shall be filed in the Probate Court in the district in which the minor resides, is domiciled or is located at the time of the filing of the petition. When appointing a guardian or coguardian, the court shall take into consideration the standards provided in section 45a-617 . The court shall take of such guardian or coguardians a written acceptance of guardianship and, if the court deems it necessary for the protection of the minor, a probate bond.\n\n(b) If any minor has a parent or guardian, who is the sole guardian of the person of the child, the Probate Court for the district in which the minor resides, is domiciled or is located at the time of the filing of the petition may, on the petition of the parent or guardian of such child or of the Commissioner of Children and Families with the consent of such parent or guardian and with regard to a child within the care of the commissioner, appoint one or more persons to serve as coguardians of the child. When appointing a guardian or guardians under this subsection, the court shall take into consideration the standards provided in section 45a-617 . The court may order that the appointment of a guardian or guardians under this subsection take effect immediately or, upon request of the parent or guardian, upon the occurrence of a specified contingency, including, but not limited to, the mental incapacity, physical debilitation or death of that parent or guardian. Upon the occurrence of such contingency and notice thereof by written affidavit to the court by the appointed guardian or guardians, such appointment shall then take effect and continue until the further order of the court, provided the court may hold a hearing to verify the occurrence of such contingency. The court shall take of such guardian or coguardians a written acceptance of guardianship, and if the court deems it necessary for the protection of the minor, a probate bond.\n\n(c) Upon receipt of a petition pursuant to this section, the court shall set a time and place for a hearing to be held within thirty days of the application, unless the court requests an investigation in accordance with the provisions of section 45a-619 , in which case the court shall set a day for hearing not more than thirty days following receipt of the results of the investigation. The court shall order notice of the hearing to be given to the minor, if age twelve or older, by first class mail not less than ten days prior to the date of the hearing. In addition, notice by first class mail shall be given to the petitioner and all other parties in interest known by the court.\n\n(d) The rights and obligations of the guardian or coguardians shall be those described in subdivisions (5) and (6) of section 45a-604 and shall be shared with the parent or previously appointed guardian of the person of the minor. The rights and obligations of guardianship may be exercised independently by those who have such rights and obligations. In the event of a dispute between guardians or between a coguardian and a parent, the matter may be submitted to the Probate Court which appointed the guardian or coguardian.\n\n(e) Upon the death of the parent or guardian, any appointed guardians of the person of a minor child shall become the sole guardians or coguardians of the person of that minor child.\n\n(f) Notwithstanding the provisions of section 45a-604 , for purposes of this section and section 45a-106a , “minor” or “minor child” means (1) a person under the age of eighteen, or (2) an unmarried person under the age of twenty-one who (A) is dependent on a competent caregiver, (B) has consented to the appointment or continuation of a guardian after attaining the age of eighteen, and (C) files or on whose behalf is filed a petition for findings pursuant to section 45a-608n ."

Such personal needs and property management shall be provided in a manner appropriate to the conserved person. The court shall make a finding of the clear and convincing evidence that supports the need for each duty and authority assigned to the conservator.",

The court may issue an order for the disclosure of such information to any other person as the court determines necessary.\n\n(e) Notwithstanding the provisions of section 45a-7 , the court may hold the hearing on the petition at a place other than its usual courtroom if it would facilitate attendance by the respondent.\n\n(f) (1) If the court finds by clear and convincing evidence that the respondent is incapable of managing the respondent's affairs, that the respondent's affairs cannot be managed adequately without the appointment of a conservator and that the appointment of a conservator is the least restrictive means of intervention available to assist the respondent in managing the respondent's affairs, the court may appoint a conservator of his or her estate after considering the factors set forth in subsection (g) of this section.\n\n(2) If the court finds by clear and convincing evidence that the respondent is incapable of caring for himself or herself, that the respondent cannot be cared for adequately without the appointment of a conservator and that the appointment of a conservator is the least restrictive means of intervention available to assist the respondent in caring for himself or herself, the court may appoint a conservator of his or her person after considering the factors set forth in subsection (g) of this section.\n\n(3) No conservator may be appointed if the respondent's personal needs and property management are being met adequately by an agency or individual appointed pursuant to the provisions of sections 1-350g and 1-352 , or section 19a-575a , 19a-577 , 19a-580e or 19a-580g .\n\n(g) When determining whether a conservator should be appointed the court shall consider the following factors: (1) The abilities of the respondent; (2) the respondent's capacity to understand and articulate an informed preference regarding the care of his or her person or the management of his or her affairs; (3) any relevant and material information obtained from the respondent; (4) evidence of the respondent's past preferences and life style choices; (5) the respondent's cultural background; (6) the desirability of maintaining continuity in the respondent's life and environment; (7) whether the respondent had previously made adequate alternative arrangements for the care of his or her person or for the management of his or her affairs, including, but not limited to, the execution of a durable power of attorney, springing power of attorney, the appointment of a health care representative or health care agent, the execution of a living will or trust or the execution of any other similar document; (8) any relevant and material evidence from the respondent's family and any other person regarding the respondent's past practices and preferences; and (9) any supportive services, technologies or other means that are available to assist the respondent in meeting his or her needs.\n\n(h) The respondent or conserved person may appoint, designate or nominate a conservator or successor conservator pursuant to section 19a-575a , 19a-580e , 19a-580g or 45a-645 , or may, orally or in writing, nominate a conservator or successor conservator who shall be appointed unless the court finds that the appointee, designee or nominee is unwilling or unable to serve or there is substantial evidence to disqualify such person. If there is no such appointment, designation or nomination or if the court does not appoint the person appointed, designated or nominated by the respondent or conserved person, the court may appoint any qualified person, authorized public official or corporation in accordance with subsections (a) and (b) of section 45a-644 . In considering whom to appoint as conservator or successor conservator, the court shall consider (1) the extent to which a proposed conservator has knowledge of the respondent's or conserved person's preferences regarding the care of his or her person or the management of his or her affairs, (2) the ability of the proposed conservator to carry out the duties, responsibilities and powers of a conservator, (3) the cost of the proposed conservatorship to the estate of the respondent or conserved person, (4) the proposed conservator's commitment to promoting the respondent's or conserved person's welfare and independence, and (5) any existing or potential conflicts of interest of the proposed conservator.\n\n(i) If the court appoints a conservator of the estate of the respondent, the court shall require a probate bond. The court may, if it considers it necessary for the protection of the respondent, require a bond of any conservator of the person appointed under this section.\n\n(j) Absent the court's order to the contrary and except as otherwise provided in subsection (b) of section 19a-580e , a conservator appointed pursuant to this section shall be bound by all health care decisions properly made by the conserved person's health care representative.\n\n(k) In assigning the duties of a conservator under this section the court may, in accordance with section 1-350g , limit, suspend or terminate the authority of an agent designated by the conserved person to act under a power of attorney; and the court shall enter a specific order as to whether the authority of the agent is limited, suspended or terminated.\n\n(l) Except as provided in subsection (k) of this section, a conserved person and his agent under a power of attorney shall retain all rights and authority not expressly assigned to the conservator.\n\n(m) The court shall assign to a conservator appointed under this section only the duties and authority that are the least restrictive means of intervention necessary to meet the needs of the conserved person. The court shall find by clear and convincing evidence that such duties and authority restrict the decision-making authority of the conserved person only to the extent necessary to provide for the personal needs or property management of the conserved person. Such personal needs and property management shall be provided in a manner appropriate to the conserved person. The court shall make a finding of the clear and convincing evidence that supports the need for each duty and authority assigned to the conservator.\n\n(n) Nothing in this chapter shall impair, limit or diminish a conserved person's right to retain an attorney to represent such person or to seek redress of grievances in any court or administrative agency, including proceedings in the nature of habeas corpus arising out of any limitations imposed on the conserved person by court action taken under this chapter, chapter 319i, chapter 319j or section 45a-242 . In any other proceeding in which the conservator has retained counsel for the conserved person, the conserved person may request the court to direct the conservator to substitute an attorney chosen by the conserved person.\n\nSee Sec. 45a-656 re duties and authority assigned by the court.\n\nSee Sec. 52-60 re appointment of probate judge as attorney for nonresident fiduciary."

              "(a) Upon written petition for appointment of a temporary conservator brought by any person considered by the Probate Court to have sufficient interest in the welfare of the respondent, including, but not limited to, the spouse or any relative of the respondent, the first selectman, chief executive officer or head of the department of welfare of the town of residence or domicile of any respondent, the Commissioner of Social Services, the board of directors of any charitable organization, as defined in section 21a-190a , or the chief administrative officer of any nonprofit hospital or such officer's designee, the court may appoint a temporary conservator if the court finds by clear and convincing evidence that: (1) The respondent is incapable of managing his or her affairs or incapable of caring for himself or herself, (2) immediate and irreparable harm to the mental or physical health or financial or legal affairs of the respondent will result if a temporary conservator is not appointed, and (3) appointment of a temporary conservator is the least restrictive means of intervention available to prevent such harm. The court shall require the temporary conservator to give a probate bond. The court shall limit the duties and authority of the temporary conservator to the circumstances that gave rise to the application and shall make specific findings, by clear and convincing evidence, of the immediate and irreparable harm that will be prevented by the appointment of a temporary conservator and that support the appointment of a temporary conservator. In making such specific findings, the court shall consider the present and previously expressed wishes of the respondent, the abilities of the respondent, any prior appointment of an attorney-in-fact, health care representative, trustee or other fiduciary acting on behalf of the respondent, any support service otherwise available to the respondent and any other relevant evidence. In appointing a temporary conservator pursuant to this section, the court shall set forth each duty or authority of the temporary conservator. The temporary conservator shall have charge of the property or of the person of the conserved person, or both, for such period or for such specific occasion as the court finds to be necessary, provided a temporary appointment shall not be valid for more than thirty days, unless at any time while the appointment of a temporary conservator is in effect, a petition is filed for appointment of a conservator of the person or estate under section 45a-650 . The court may (A) extend the appointment of the temporary conservator until the disposition of such petition under section 45a-650 , or for an additional thirty days, whichever occurs first, or (B) terminate the appointment of a temporary conservator upon a showing that the circumstances that gave rise to the petition for appointment of a temporary conservator no longer exist. No appointment of a temporary conservator under this section may be in effect for more than sixty days from the date of the initial appointment.",
              "(b) Unless the court waives the medical evidence requirement pursuant to subsection (e) of this section, an appointment of a temporary conservator shall not be made unless a report is filed with the petition for appointment of a temporary conservator, signed by a physician licensed to practice medicine or surgery in this state, stating: (1) That the physician has examined the respondent and the date of such examination, which shall not be more than three days prior to the date of presentation to the judge; (2) that it is the opinion of the physician that the respondent is incapable of managing his or her affairs or incapable of caring for himself or herself; and (3) the reasons for such opinion. Any physician's report filed with the court pursuant to this subsection shall be confidential. The court shall provide for the disclosure of the medical information required pursuant to this subsection to the respondent on the respondent's request, to the respondent's attorney and to any other party considered appropriate by the court.",
              "(c) Upon receipt of a petition for the appointment of a temporary conservator, the court shall issue notice to the respondent, appoint counsel for the respondent and conduct a hearing on the petition in the manner set forth in sections 45a-649 , 45a-649a and 45a-650 , except that (1) notice to the respondent shall be given not less than five days before the hearing, which shall be conducted not later than seven days after the petition is filed, excluding Saturdays, Sundays and holidays, or (2) where a petition has been made ex parte for the appointment of a temporary conservator, notice shall be given to the respondent not more than forty-eight hours after the ex parte appointment of a temporary conservator, with the hearing on such ex parte appointment to be conducted not later than three days after the ex parte appointment, excluding Saturdays, Sundays and holidays. Service on the respondent of the notice of the petition for the appointment of a temporary conservator shall be in hand and shall be made by a state marshal, constable or an indifferent person. Notice shall include (A) a copy of the petition for appointment of a temporary conservator and any physician's report filed with the petition pursuant to subsection (b) of this section, (B) a copy of an ex parte order, if any, appointing a temporary conservator, and (C) the date, time and place of the hearing on the petition for the appointment of a temporary conservator. The court may not appoint a temporary conservator until the court has made the findings required in this section and held a hearing on the petition, except as provided in subsection (d) of this section. If notice is provided to the next of kin with respect to a petition filed under this section, the physician's report shall not be disclosed to the next of kin except by order of the court.",
              "(d) (1) If the court determines that the delay resulting from giving notice and appointing an attorney to represent the respondent as required in subsection (c) of this section would cause immediate and irreparable harm to the mental or physical health or financial or legal affairs of the respondent, the court may, ex parte and without prior notice to the respondent, appoint a temporary conservator upon receiving evidence and making the findings required in subsection (a) of this section, provided the court makes a specific finding in any decree issued on the petition stating the immediate or irreparable harm that formed the basis for the court's determination and why such hearing and appointment was not required before making an ex parte appointment. If an ex parte order of appointment of a temporary conservator is made, a hearing on the petition for appointment of a temporary conservator shall be commenced not later than three days after the ex parte order was issued, excluding Saturdays, Sundays and holidays. An ex parte order shall expire not later than three days after the order was issued unless a hearing on the order that commenced prior to the expiration of the three-day period has been continued for good cause.",
              "(2) After a hearing held under this subsection, the court may appoint a temporary conservator or may confirm or revoke the ex parte appointment of the temporary conservator or may modify the duties and authority assigned under such appointment.",
              "(e) The court may waive the medical evidence requirement under subsection (b) of this section if the court finds that the evidence is impossible to obtain because of the refusal of the respondent to be examined by a physician. In any such case the court may, in lieu of medical evidence, accept other competent evidence. In any case in which the court waives the medical evidence requirement as provided in this subsection, the court may not appoint a temporary conservator unless the court finds, by clear and convincing evidence, that (1) the respondent is incapable of managing his or her affairs or incapable of caring for himself or herself, and (2) immediate and irreparable harm to the mental or physical health or financial or legal affairs of the respondent will result if a temporary conservator is not appointed pursuant to this section. In any case in which the court waives the requirement of medical evidence as provided in this subsection, the court shall make a specific finding in any decree issued on the petition stating why medical evidence was not required.",
              "(f) Upon the termination of the temporary conservatorship, the temporary conservator shall file, if applicable, a final accounting as directed by the court, of his or her actions as temporary conservator.",

            "text": "(a) Upon written petition for appointment of a temporary conservator brought by any person considered by the Probate Court to have sufficient interest in the welfare of the respondent, including, but not limited to, the spouse or any relative of the respondent, the first selectman, chief executive officer or head of the department of welfare of the town of residence or domicile of any respondent, the Commissioner of Social Services, the board of directors of any charitable organization, as defined in section 21a-190a , or the chief administrative officer of any nonprofit hospital or such officer's designee, the court may appoint a temporary conservator if the court finds by clear and convincing evidence that: (1) The respondent is incapable of managing his or her affairs or incapable of caring for himself or herself, (2) immediate and irreparable harm to the mental or physical health or financial or legal affairs of the respondent will result if a temporary conservator is not appointed, and (3) appointment of a temporary conservator is the least restrictive means of intervention available to prevent such harm. The court shall require the temporary conservator to give a probate bond. The court shall limit the duties and authority of the temporary conservator to the circumstances that gave rise to the application and shall make specific findings, by clear and convincing evidence, of the immediate and irreparable harm that will be prevented by the appointment of a temporary conservator and that support the appointment of a temporary conservator. In making such specific findings, the court shall consider the present and previously expressed wishes of the respondent, the abilities of the respondent, any prior appointment of an attorney-in-fact, health care representative, trustee or other fiduciary acting on behalf of the respondent, any support service otherwise available to the respondent and any other relevant evidence. In appointing a temporary conservator pursuant to this section, the court shall set forth each duty or authority of the temporary conservator. The temporary conservator shall have charge of the property or of the person of the conserved person, or both, for such period or for such specific occasion as the court finds to be necessary, provided a temporary appointment shall not be valid for more than thirty days, unless at any time while the appointment of a temporary conservator is in effect, a petition is filed for appointment of a conservator of the person or estate under section 45a-650 . The court may (A) extend the appointment of the temporary conservator until the disposition of such petition under section 45a-650 , or for an additional thirty days, whichever occurs first, or (B) terminate the appointment of a temporary conservator upon a showing that the circumstances that gave rise to the petition for appointment of a temporary conservator no longer exist. No appointment of a temporary conservator under this section may be in effect for more than sixty days from the date of the initial appointment.\n\n(b) Unless the court waives the medical evidence requirement pursuant to subsection (e) of this section, an appointment of a temporary conservator shall not be made unless a report is filed with the petition for appointment of a temporary conservator, signed by a physician licensed to practice medicine or surgery in this state, stating: (1) That the physician has examined the respondent and the date of such examination, which shall not be more than three days prior to the date of presentation to the judge; (2) that it is the opinion of the physician that the respondent is incapable of managing his or her affairs or incapable of caring for himself or herself; and (3) the reasons for such opinion. Any physician's report filed with the court pursuant to this subsection shall be confidential. The court shall provide for the disclosure of the medical information required pursuant to this subsection to the respondent on the respondent's request, to the respondent's attorney and to any other party considered appropriate by the court.\n\n(c) Upon receipt of a petition for the appointment of a temporary conservator, the court shall issue notice to the respondent, appoint counsel for the respondent and conduct a hearing on the petition in the manner set forth in sections 45a-649 , 45a-649a and 45a-650 , except that (1) notice to the respondent shall be given not less than five days before the hearing, which shall be conducted not later than seven days after the petition is filed, excluding Saturdays, Sundays and holidays, or (2) where a petition has been made ex parte for the appointment of a temporary conservator, notice shall be given to the respondent not more than forty-eight hours after the ex parte appointment of a temporary conservator, with the hearing on such ex parte appointment to be conducted not later than three days after the ex parte appointment, excluding Saturdays, Sundays and holidays. Service on the respondent of the notice of the petition for the appointment of a temporary conservator shall be in hand and shall be made by a state marshal, constable or an indifferent person. Notice shall include (A) a copy of the petition for appointment of a temporary conservator and any physician's report filed with the petition pursuant to subsection (b) of this section, (B) a copy of an ex parte order, if any, appointing a temporary conservator, and (C) the date, time and place of the hearing on the petition for the appointment of a temporary conservator. The court may not appoint a temporary conservator until the court has made the findings required in this section and held a hearing on the petition, except as provided in subsection (d) of this section. If notice is provided to the next of kin with respect to a petition filed under this section, the physician's report shall not be disclosed to the next of kin except by order of the court.\n\n(d) (1) If the court determines that the delay resulting from giving notice and appointing an attorney to represent the respondent as required in subsection (c) of this section would cause immediate and irreparable harm to the mental or physical health or financial or legal affairs of the respondent, the court may, ex parte and without prior notice to the respondent, appoint a temporary conservator upon receiving evidence and making the findings required in subsection (a) of this section, provided the court makes a specific finding in any decree issued on the petition stating the immediate or irreparable harm that formed the basis for the court's determination and why such hearing and appointment was not required before making an ex parte appointment. If an ex parte order of appointment of a temporary conservator is made, a hearing on the petition for appointment of a temporary conservator shall be commenced not later than three days after the ex parte order was issued, excluding Saturdays, Sundays and holidays. An ex parte order shall expire not later than three days after the order was issued unless a hearing on the order that commenced prior to the expiration of the three-day period has been continued for good cause.\n\n(2) After a hearing held under this subsection, the court may appoint a temporary conservator or may confirm or revoke the ex parte appointment of the temporary conservator or may modify the duties and authority assigned under such appointment.\n\n(e) The court may waive the medical evidence requirement under subsection (b) of this section if the court finds that the evidence is impossible to obtain because of the refusal of the respondent to be examined by a physician. In any such case the court may, in lieu of medical evidence, accept other competent evidence. In any case in which the court waives the medical evidence requirement as provided in this subsection, the court may not appoint a temporary conservator unless the court finds, by clear and convincing evidence, that (1) the respondent is incapable of managing his or her affairs or incapable of caring for himself or herself, and (2) immediate and irreparable harm to the mental or physical health or financial or legal affairs of the respondent will result if a temporary conservator is not appointed pursuant to this section. In any case in which the court waives the requirement of medical evidence as provided in this subsection, the court shall make a specific finding in any decree issued on the petition stating why medical evidence was not required.\n\n(f) Upon the termination of the temporary conservatorship, the temporary conservator shall file, if applicable, a final accounting as directed by the court, of his or her actions as temporary conservator.\n\nSee Sec. 45a-132a re respondent's ability to refuse to undergo examination ordered by the court under said section."

              "(a) A conservator of the estate appointed under section 45a-646 , 45a-650 or 45a-654 shall, within two months after the date of the conservator's appointment, make and file in the Probate Court, an inventory, under penalty of false statement, of the estate of the conserved person, with the properties thereof appraised or caused to be appraised, by such conservator, at fair market value as of the date of the conservator's appointment. Such inventory shall include the value of the conserved person's interest in all property in which the conserved person has a legal or equitable present interest, including, but not limited to, the conserved person's interest in any joint bank accounts or other jointly held property. The conservator shall manage all the estate and apply so much of the net income thereof, and, if necessary, any part of the principal of the property, which is required to support the conserved person and those members of the conserved person's family whom the conserved person has the legal duty to support and to pay the conserved person's debts, and may sue for and collect all debts due the conserved person. The conservator, in the exercise of his or her duties and authority, shall be guided by the standards of practice adopted under subsection (h) of section 45a-77 and shall use the least restrictive means of intervention.",
              "(b) Any conservator of the estate of a married person may apply such portion of the property of the conserved person to the support, maintenance and medical treatment of the conserved person's spouse which the Probate Court, upon hearing after notice, decides to be proper under the circumstances of the case.",
              "(c) Notwithstanding the provisions of section 45a-177 , the court may, and at the request of any interested party shall, require annual accountings from any conservator of the estate and the court shall hold a hearing on any such account with notice to all persons entitled to notice under section 45a-649 .",
              "(d) In the case of any person receiving public assistance, state-administered general assistance or Medicaid, the conservator of the estate shall apply toward the cost of care of such person any assets exceeding limits on assets set by statute or regulations adopted by the Commissioner of Social Services. Notwithstanding the provisions of subsections (a) and (b) of this section, in the case of an institutionalized person who has applied for or is receiving such medical assistance, no conservator shall apply and no court shall approve the application of (1) the net income of the conserved person to the support of the conserved person's spouse in an amount that exceeds the monthly income allowed a community spouse as determined by the Department of Social Services pursuant to 42 USC 1396r-5(d)(2)-(4), or (2) any portion of the property of the conserved person to the support, maintenance and medical treatment of the conserved person's spouse in an amount that exceeds the amount determined allowable by the department pursuant to 42 USC 1396r-5(f)(1) and (2), notwithstanding the provisions of 42 USC 1396r-5(f)(2)(A)(iv), unless such limitations on income would result in significant financial duress.",
              "(e) Upon application of a conservator of the estate, after a hearing with notice to the Commissioner of Administrative Services, the Commissioner of Social Services and to all parties who may have an interest as determined by the court, the court may authorize the conservator to make gifts or other transfers of income and principal from the estate of the conserved person in such amounts and in such form, outright or in trust, whether to an existing trust or a court-approved trust created by the conservator, as the court orders to or for the benefit of individuals, including the conserved person, and to or for the benefit of charities, trusts or other institutions described in Sections 2055(a) and 2522(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, or any corresponding internal revenue code of the United States, as from time to time amended. Such gifts or transfers shall be authorized only if the court finds that: (1) In the case of individuals not related to the conserved person by blood or marriage, the conserved person had made a previous gift to that unrelated individual prior to being declared incapable; (2) in the case of a charity, either (A) the conserved person had made a previous gift to such charity, had pledged a gift in writing to such charity, or had otherwise demonstrated support for such charity prior to being declared incapable; or (B) the court determines that the gift to the charity is in the best interests of the conserved person, is consistent with proper estate planning, and there is no reasonable objection by a party having an interest in the conserved person's estate as determined by the court; (3) the estate of the conserved person and any proposed trust of which the conserved person is a beneficiary is more than sufficient to carry out the duties of the conservator as set forth in subsections (a) and (b) of this section, both for the present and foreseeable future, including due provision for the continuing proper care, comfort and maintenance of such conserved person in accordance with such conserved person's established standard of living and for the support of persons the conserved person is legally obligated to support; (4) the purpose of the gifts is not to diminish the estate of the conserved person so as to qualify the conserved person for federal or state aid or benefits; and (5) in the case of a conserved person capable of making an informed decision, the conserved person has no objection to such gift. The court shall give consideration to the following: (A) The medical condition of the conserved person, including the prospect of restoration to capacity; (B) the size of the conserved person's estate; (C) the provisions which, in the judgment of the court, such conserved person would have made if such conserved person had been capable, for minimization of income and estate taxes consistent with proper estate planning; and (D) in the case of a trust, whether the trust should be revocable or irrevocable, existing or created by the conservator and court approved. The court should also consider the provisions of an existing estate plan, if any. In the case of a gift or transfer in trust, any transfer to a court-approved trust created by the conservator shall be subject to continuing probate court jurisdiction in the same manner as a testamentary trust including periodic rendering of accounts pursuant to section 45a-177 . Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, the court may authorize the creation and funding of a trust that complies with section 1917(d)(4) of the Social Security Act, 42 USC 1396p(d)(4), as from time to time amended. The provisions of this subsection shall not be construed to validate or invalidate any gifts made by a conservator of the estate prior to October 1, 1998.",
              "(f) When determining whether a conservator has breached a fiduciary duty, the Probate Court having jurisdiction over the conservatorship may consider evidence of a conservator's failure to adhere to a provision contained in the standards of practice adopted under subsection (h) of section 45a-77 but such failure shall not, in itself, constitute a breach of fiduciary duty.",

Such inventory shall include the value of the conserved person's interest in all property in which the conserved person has a legal or equitable present interest, including, but not limited to, the conserved person's interest in any joint bank accounts or other jointly held property. The conservator shall manage all the estate and apply so much of the net income thereof, and, if necessary, any part of the principal of the property, which is required to support the conserved person and those members of the conserved person's family whom the conserved person has the legal duty to support and to pay the conserved person's debts, and may sue for and collect all debts due the conserved person. The conservator, in the exercise of his or her duties and authority, shall be guided by the standards of practice adopted under subsection (h) of section 45a-77 and shall use the least restrictive means of intervention.\n\n(b) Any conservator of the estate of a married person may apply such portion of the property of the conserved person to the support, maintenance and medical treatment of the conserved person's spouse which the Probate Court, upon hearing after notice, decides to be proper under the circumstances of the case.\n\n(c) Notwithstanding the provisions of section 45a-177 , the court may, and at the request of any interested party shall, require annual accountings from any conservator of the estate and the court shall hold a hearing on any such account with notice to all persons entitled to notice under section 45a-649 .\n\n(d) In the case of any person receiving public assistance, state-administered general assistance or Medicaid, the conservator of the estate shall apply toward the cost of care of such person any assets exceeding limits on assets set by statute or regulations adopted by the Commissioner of Social Services. Notwithstanding the provisions of subsections (a) and (b) of this section, in the case of an institutionalized person who has applied for or is receiving such medical assistance, no conservator shall apply and no court shall approve the application of (1) the net income of the conserved person to the support of the conserved person's spouse in an amount that exceeds the monthly income allowed a community spouse as determined by the Department of Social Services pursuant to 42 USC 1396r-5(d)(2)-(4), or (2) any portion of the property of the conserved person to the support, maintenance and medical treatment of the conserved person's spouse in an amount that exceeds the amount determined allowable by the department pursuant to 42 USC 1396r-5(f)(1) and (2), notwithstanding the provisions of 42 USC 1396r-5(f)(2)(A)(iv), unless such limitations on income would result in significant financial duress.\n\n(e) Upon application of a conservator of the estate, after a hearing with notice to the Commissioner of Administrative Services, the Commissioner of Social Services and to all parties who may have an interest as determined by the court, the court may authorize the conservator to make gifts or other transfers of income and principal from the estate of the conserved person in such amounts and in such form, outright or in trust, whether to an existing trust or a court-approved trust created by the conservator, as the court orders to or for the benefit of individuals, including the conserved person, and to or for the benefit of charities, trusts or other institutions described in Sections 2055(a) and 2522(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, or any corresponding internal revenue code of the United States, as from time to time amended. Such gifts or transfers shall be authorized only if the court finds that: (1) In the case of individuals not related to the conserved person by blood or marriage, the conserved person had made a previous gift to that unrelated individual prior to being declared incapable; (2) in the case of a charity, either (A) the conserved person had made a previous gift to such charity, had pledged a gift in writing to such charity, or had otherwise demonstrated support for such charity prior to being declared incapable; or (B) the court determines that the gift to the charity is in the best interests of the conserved person, is consistent with proper estate planning, and there is no reasonable objection by a party having an interest in the conserved person's estate as determined by the court; (3) the estate of the conserved person and any proposed trust of which the conserved person is a beneficiary is more than sufficient to carry out the duties of the conservator as set forth in subsections (a) and (b) of this section, both for the present and foreseeable future, including due provision for the continuing proper care, comfort and maintenance of such conserved person in accordance with such conserved person's established standard of living and for the support of persons the conserved person is legally obligated to support; (4) the purpose of the gifts is not to diminish the estate of the conserved person so as to qualify the conserved person for federal or state aid or benefits; and (5) in the case of a conserved person capable of making an informed decision, the conserved person has no objection to such gift. The court shall give consideration to the following: (A) The medical condition of the conserved person, including the prospect of restoration to capacity; (B) the size of the conserved person's estate; (C) the provisions which, in the judgment of the court, such conserved person would have made if such conserved person had been capable, for minimization of income and estate taxes consistent with proper estate planning; and (D) in the case of a trust, whether the trust should be revocable or irrevocable, existing or created by the conservator and court approved. The court should also consider the provisions of an existing estate plan, if any. In the case of a gift or transfer in trust, any transfer to a court-approved trust created by the conservator shall be subject to continuing probate court jurisdiction in the same manner as a testamentary trust including periodic rendering of accounts pursuant to section 45a-177 . Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, the court may authorize the creation and funding of a trust that complies with section 1917(d)(4) of the Social Security Act, 42 USC 1396p(d)(4), as from time to time amended. The provisions of this subsection shall not be construed to validate or invalidate any gifts made by a conservator of the estate prior to October 1, 1998.\n\n(f) When determining whether a conservator has breached a fiduciary duty, the Probate Court having jurisdiction over the conservatorship may consider evidence of a conservator's failure to adhere to a provision contained in the standards of practice adopted under subsection (h) of section 45a-77 but such failure shall not, in itself, constitute a breach of fiduciary duty.\n\nSee Sec. 17b-261b re Probate Court's responsibility to cooperate with Department of Social Services concerning applications for spousal support.\n\nSee Secs. 45a-166, 45a-660 re distribution of proceeds from sale of real estate.\n\nSee Sec. 45a-203 re investment of funds held by the trustees, guardians or conservators.\n\nSee Sec. 45a-595 re investment of funds in insurance and annuity contracts by conservator or guardian of estate."

            "text": "(a)(1) For the purposes of this section: (A) “Institution for long-term care” means a facility that has been federally certified as a skilled nursing facility, an intermediate care facility, a residential care home, an extended care facility, a nursing home, a rest home or a rehabilitation hospital or facility; and (B) “person under conservatorship” means a conserved person or a person under voluntary representation pursuant to section 45a-646 .\n\n(2) Except as provided in subsections (b), (c), (d), (e) and (f) of this section, a conservator may not terminate a tenancy or lease of a person under conservatorship, sell or dispose of any real property or household furnishings of the person under conservatorship, or change the residence of the person under conservatorship unless a Probate Court finds, after a hearing, that such termination, sale, disposal or change is necessary or that the person under conservatorship agrees to such termination, sale, disposal or change.\n\n(b) If the conservator determines it is necessary to cause the person under conservatorship to be placed in an institution for long-term care or to change the residence of the person under conservatorship, the conservator shall file a report of the intended placement in an institution for long-term care or change of residence with the Probate Court that appointed the conservator. The court shall hold a hearing to consider the report. If, after the hearing, the conservator obtains permission of the court for the intended placement or change of residence, the conservator may make such a placement or implement such a change of residence. The hearing shall be held not less than five days after the filing of the report, excluding Saturdays, Sundays and holidays, and not less than seventy-two hours before the placement in the institution for long-term care or the change of residence, except that if the placement in an institution for long-term care results from the discharge from a hospital of a person under conservatorship, the conservator may make the placement before filing the report, provided the conservator (1) files the report not later than five days after making such placement, and (2) includes in the report a statement as to the hospital discharge and related circumstances requiring the placement of the person under conservatorship in the institution for long-term care. No such placement made before the filing of the report of the conservator shall continue unless ordered by the Probate Court after a hearing held pursuant to this section.\n\n(c) A report filed under subsection (b) of this section with respect to placement in an institution for long-term care shall set forth the basis for the conservator's determination, what community resources are available and have been considered to avoid the placement, and the reasons why the physical, mental and psychosocial needs of the person under conservatorship cannot be met in a less restrictive and more integrated setting. Such community resources include, but are not limited to, resources provided by the area agencies on aging, the Department of Social Services, the Department of Mental Health and Addiction Services, the Department of Developmental Services, any center for independent living, as defined in section 17a-792 , any residential care home or any congregate or subsidized housing. The conservator shall give notice of the placement of the person under conservatorship in an institution for long-term care and a copy of such report to the person under conservatorship, the attorney for the person under conservatorship and any interested parties as determined by the court. Service shall be by first-class mail. The conservator shall provide a certification to the court that service was made in the manner prescribed by this subsection.\n\n(d) The person under conservatorship may, at any time, request a hearing by the court on the person's placement in an institution for long-term care which hearing may determine the availability of a less restrictive alternative for the person's placement. On request of the person under conservatorship made after the initial hearing held under subsection (b) of this section, the court shall hold a hearing on the placement not later than ten days, excluding Saturdays, Sundays and holidays, after receipt by the court of such request. The court shall not be required to conduct a hearing under this subsection more than three times in any twelve-month period following the hearing held under subsection (b) of this section authorizing the initial placement, except that the court shall conduct a hearing whenever information not previously available to the court is submitted with a request for a hearing.\n\n(e) After the initial hearing held under subsection (b) of this section, the court may hold a hearing on a conservator's report and the placement of the person under conservatorship in an institution for long-term care in any case even if no request for a hearing is made.\n\n(f) If the court, after a hearing on the placement of the person under conservatorship in an institution for long-term care, determines that the physical, mental and psychosocial needs of the person under conservatorship can be met in a less restrictive and more integrated setting within the resources available to the person under conservatorship, either through the estate of the person under conservatorship or through private or public assistance, the court shall order that the person under conservatorship be placed and maintained in a less restrictive and more integrated setting.\n\n(g) A person under conservatorship may waive the right to a hearing required under this section if the attorney for the person under conservatorship has consulted with the person under conservatorship and the attorney has filed with the court a record of the waiver. Such a waiver shall be invalid if the waiver does not represent the wishes of the person under conservatorship. If a person under voluntary representation pursuant to section 45a-646 is not represented by an attorney, the court shall conduct a hearing to determine whether the waiver represents the person's wishes."

              "(a)(1) A conserved person may, at any time, petition the Probate Court having jurisdiction for the termination of a conservatorship. A petition for termination of a conservatorship shall be determined by a preponderance of the evidence. The conserved person shall not be required to present medical evidence at such a hearing. A hearing on the petition shall be held not later than thirty days after the date the petition was filed in the Probate Court, unless the hearing is continued for good cause. If such hearing is not held within such thirty-day period or continuance period, if applicable, the conservatorship shall terminate. If the Probate Court having jurisdiction finds a conserved person to be capable of caring for himself or herself, the court shall, upon hearing and after notice, order that the conservatorship of the person be terminated. If the court finds upon hearing and after notice which the court prescribes, that a conserved person is capable of managing his or her own affairs, the court shall order that the conservatorship of the estate be terminated and that the remaining portion of the conserved person's property be restored to the conserved person. Unless the court determines that reinstatement is not in the best interests of the conserved person, the court shall order the reinstatement of any authority of any agent under a power of attorney that was previously limited or suspended by the court because of the conservatorship. (2) If the court finds upon hearing and after notice which the court prescribes that a conserved person has no assets of any kind remaining except for that amount allowed by subsection (c) of section 17b-80 , the court may order that the conservatorship of the estate be terminated. The court shall thereupon order distribution of the remaining assets to the conservator of the person or, if there is no conservator or the conservator declines or is unable to accept or the conservator is the Commissioner of Social Services, to some suitable person, to be determined by the court, to hold for the benefit of the conserved person, upon such conservator or person giving such probate bond, if any, as the court orders. (3) If any conserved person having a conservator dies, the conserved person's property other than property which has accrued from the sale of the conserved person's real property shall be delivered to the conserved person's executor or administrator. The unexpended proceeds of the conserved person's real property sold as aforesaid shall go into the hands of the executor or administrator, to be distributed as such real property would have been.",
              "(b) (1) In any case under subsection (a) of this section the conservator shall file in the court the conservator's final account, and the court shall audit the account and allow the account if it is found to be correct. If the conserved person is living, the conserved person and the conserved person's attorney, if any, shall be entitled to notice by first class mail of any hearing held on the final account. (2) The court of probate having jurisdiction shall send written notice annually to the conserved person and the conserved person's attorney that the conserved person has a right to a hearing under this section. Upon receipt of request for such hearing the court shall set a time and date for the hearing, which date shall not be more than thirty days from the receipt of the request unless continued for cause shown.",
              "(c) The court shall review each conservatorship not later than one year after the conservatorship was ordered, and not less than every three years after such initial one-year review. After each such review, the court shall continue, modify or terminate the order for conservatorship. The court shall receive and review written evidence as to the condition of the conserved person. The conservator and a physician licensed to practice medicine in this state shall each submit a written report to the court not more than forty-five days after the court's request for such report, except that for a person with intellectual disability, as defined in section 1-1g , a psychologist licensed pursuant to chapter 383 may submit such written report in lieu of a physician. On receipt of a written report from the conservator or a physician or psychologist, as the case may be, the court shall provide a copy of the report to the conserved person and the attorney for the conserved person. If the conserved person is unable to request or obtain an attorney, the court shall appoint an attorney. If the conserved person is unable to pay for the services of the attorney, the reasonable rates of compensation of such attorney shall be established by, and the attorney shall be paid from funds appropriated to, the Judicial Department. If funds have not been included in the budget of the Judicial Department for such purposes, such rates of compensation shall be established by the Probate Court Administrator and the attorney shall be paid from the Probate Court Administration Fund. The physician or psychologist, as the case may be, shall examine the conserved person not more than forty-five days prior to the date of submission of the physician's or psychologist's report. Any physician's or psychologist's report filed with the court pursuant to this subsection shall be confidential. The court may issue an order for the disclosure of medical information or psychological information received pursuant to this subsection, except that the court shall issue an order for the disclosure of such information to the conserved person's attorney. Not later than thirty days after receipt of the conservator's report and the physician's or psychologist's report, as the case may be, the attorney for the conserved person shall notify the court that the attorney has met with the conserved person and shall inform the court as to whether a hearing is being requested. Nothing in this section shall prevent the conserved person or the conserved person's attorney from requesting a hearing at any other time as permitted by law.",
              "(d) If the court finds, after receipt of the reports from the attorney for the conserved person, the physician or psychologist, as the case may be, and the conservator, by clear and convincing evidence, that the conserved person continues to be incapable of managing his or her affairs or continues to be incapable of caring for himself or herself, as the case may be, and that there are no less restrictive means available to assist the conserved person in managing his or her affairs or caring for himself or herself, as the case may be, the court shall continue or modify the conservatorship under the terms and conditions of the appointment of the conservator under section 45a-650 . If the court does not make such a finding of continued incapacity by clear and convincing evidence, the court shall terminate the conservatorship. A hearing on the condition of the conserved person shall not be required under this subsection, except that the court may hold a hearing in its discretion and shall hold a hearing if the conserved person, conserved person's attorney or conservator requests a hearing, in which case the court shall hold a hearing within thirty days of such request."

            "text": "(a)(1) A conserved person may, at any time, petition the Probate Court having jurisdiction for the termination of a conservatorship. A petition for termination of a conservatorship shall be determined by a preponderance of the evidence. The conserved person shall not be required to present medical evidence at such a hearing. A hearing on the petition shall be held not later than thirty days after the date the petition was filed in the Probate Court, unless the hearing is continued for good cause. If such hearing is not held within such thirty-day period or continuance period, if applicable, the conservatorship shall terminate. If the Probate Court having jurisdiction finds a conserved person to be capable of caring for himself or herself, the court shall, upon hearing and after notice, order that the conservatorship of the person be terminated. If the court finds upon hearing and after notice which the court prescribes, that a conserved person is capable of managing his or her own affairs, the court shall order that the conservatorship of the estate be terminated and that the remaining portion of the conserved person's property be restored to the conserved person. Unless the court determines that reinstatement is not in the best interests of the conserved person, the court shall order the reinstatement of any authority of any agent under a power of attorney that was previously limited or suspended by the court because of the conservatorship. (2) If the court finds upon hearing and after notice which the court prescribes that a conserved person has no assets of any kind remaining except for that amount allowed by subsection (c) of section 17b-80 , the court may order that the conservatorship of the estate be terminated. The court shall thereupon order distribution of the remaining assets to the conservator of the person or, if there is no conservator or the conservator declines or is unable to accept or the conservator is the Commissioner of Social Services, to some suitable person, to be determined by the court, to hold for the benefit of the conserved person, upon such conservator or person giving such probate bond, if any, as the court orders. (3) If any conserved person having a conservator dies, the conserved person's property other than property which has accrued from the sale of the conserved person's real property shall be delivered to the conserved person's executor or administrator. The unexpended proceeds of the conserved person's real property sold as aforesaid shall go into the hands of the executor or administrator, to be distributed as such real property would have been.\n\n(b) (1) In any case under subsection (a) of this section the conservator shall file in the court the conservator's final account, and the court shall audit the account and allow the account if it is found to be correct. If the conserved person is living, the conserved person and the conserved person's attorney, if any, shall be entitled to notice by first class mail of any hearing held on the final account. (2) The court of probate having jurisdiction shall send written notice annually to the conserved person and the conserved person's attorney that the conserved person has a right to a hearing under this section. Upon receipt of request for such hearing the court shall set a time and date for the hearing, which date shall not be more than thirty days from the receipt of the request unless continued for cause shown.\n\n(c) The court shall review each conservatorship not later than one year after the conservatorship was ordered, and not less than every three years after such initial one-year review. After each such review, the court shall continue, modify or terminate the order for conservatorship. The court shall receive and review written evidence as to the condition of the conserved person. The conservator and a physician licensed to practice medicine in this state shall each submit a written report to the court not more than forty-five days after the court's request for such report, except that for a person with intellectual disability, as defined in section 1-1g , a psychologist licensed pursuant to chapter 383 may submit such written report in lieu of a physician. On receipt of a written report from the conservator or a physician or psychologist, as the case may be, the court shall provide a copy of the report to the conserved person and the attorney for the conserved person. If the conserved person is unable to request or obtain an attorney, the court shall appoint an attorney. If the conserved person is unable to pay for the services of the attorney, the reasonable rates of compensation of such attorney shall be established by, and the attorney shall be paid from funds appropriated to, the Judicial Department. If funds have not been included in the budget of the Judicial Department for such purposes, such rates of compensation shall be established by the Probate Court Administrator and the attorney shall be paid from the Probate Court Administration Fund. The physician or psychologist, as the case may be, shall examine the conserved person not more than forty-five days prior to the date of submission of the physician's or psychologist's report. Any physician's or psychologist's report filed with the court pursuant to this subsection shall be confidential. The court may issue an order for the disclosure of medical information or psychological information received pursuant to this subsection, except that the court shall issue an order for the disclosure of such information to the conserved person's attorney. Not later than thirty days after receipt of the conservator's report and the physician's or psychologist's report, as the case may be, the attorney for the conserved person shall notify the court that the attorney has met with the conserved person and shall inform the court as to whether a hearing is being requested. Nothing in this section shall prevent the conserved person or the conserved person's attorney from requesting a hearing at any other time as permitted by law.\n\n(d) If the court finds, after receipt of the reports from the attorney for the conserved person, the physician or psychologist, as the case may be, and the conservator, by clear and convincing evidence, that the conserved person continues to be incapable of managing his or her affairs or continues to be incapable of caring for himself or herself, as the case may be, and that there are no less restrictive means available to assist the conserved person in managing his or her affairs or caring for himself or herself, as the case may be, the court shall continue or modify the conservatorship under the terms and conditions of the appointment of the conservator under section 45a-650 . If the court does not make such a finding of continued incapacity by clear and convincing evidence, the court shall terminate the conservatorship. A hearing on the condition of the conserved person shall not be required under this subsection, except that the court may hold a hearing in its discretion and shall hold a hearing if the conserved person, conserved person's attorney or conservator requests a hearing, in which case the court shall hold a hearing within thirty days of such request."

If the Probate Court determines that there is such reasonable cause, the Probate Court may order that the financial hold be modified or continued for a period not to exceed thirty days from the date of the order or until the appointment of a conservator for the eligible adult, whichever occurs first.\n\n(e) Upon disposition of a petition under this section, the Probate Court may order that the petitioner be reimbursed for the fee to file the petition set forth in subsection (b) of section 45a-106a , as the Probate Court deems equitable, except that no financial agent shall be responsible for such reimbursement and a financial institution shall be liable for such reimbursement only if the Probate Court finds that the financial institution did not have reasonable cause to believe that a transaction or disbursement involving an account of an eligible adult may have involved, facilitated, resulted in or contributed to the financial exploitation of such eligible adult.\n\n(f) Nothing in this section shall be construed to limit any immunities, causes of action or remedies provided under the Connecticut Uniform Power of Attorney Act, sections 1-350 to 1-353b , inclusive."

No consent to termination by a mother shall be executed within forty-eight hours immediately after the birth of her child. A parent who is a minor shall have the right to consent to termination of parental rights and such consent shall not be voidable by reason of such minority.

              "(g) Before a hearing on the merits in any case in which a petition for termination of parental rights is contested in a Probate Court, the Probate Court shall, on the motion of any legal party except the petitioner, or may on its own motion or that of the petitioner, transfer the case to the Superior Court in accordance with rules adopted by the judges of the Supreme Court. In addition to the provisions of this section, the Probate Court may, on the court's own motion or that of any interested party, transfer any termination of parental rights case to a Regional Children's Probate Court established pursuant to section 45a-8a . If the case is transferred, the clerk of the Probate Court shall transmit to the clerk of the Superior Court or the Regional Children's Probate Court to which the case was transferred, the original files and papers in the case.

Such an agreement may be entered into if: (1) An order terminating parental rights has not yet been entered; and (2) either or both birth parents agree to a voluntary termination of parental rights, including an agreement in a case which began as an involuntary termination of parental rights. The postadoption agreement shall be applicable only to a birth parent who is a party to the agreement. Such agreement shall be in addition to those under common law. Counsel for the child and any guardian ad litem for the child may be heard on the proposed cooperative postadoption agreement. There shall be no presumption of communication or contact between the birth parents and an intended adoptive parent in the absence of a cooperative postadoption agreement.",

A court may grant postadoption communication or contact privileges if: (1) Each intended adoptive parent consents to the granting of communication or contact privileges; (2) the intended adoptive parent and either or both birth parents execute a cooperative agreement and file the agreement with the court; (3) consent to postadoption communication or contact is obtained from the child, if the child is at least twelve years of age; and (4) the cooperative postadoption agreement is approved by the court.",
              "(j) A cooperative postadoption agreement shall contain the following: (1) An acknowledgment by either or both birth parents that the termination of parental rights and the adoption is irrevocable, even if the adoptive parents do not abide by the cooperative postadoption agreement; and (2) an acknowledgment by the adoptive parents that the agreement grants either or both birth parents the right to seek to enforce the cooperative postadoption agreement.",
              "(k) The terms of a cooperative postadoption agreement may include the following: (1) Provision for communication between the child and either or both birth parents; (2) provision for future contact between either or both birth parents and the child or an adoptive parent; and (3) maintenance of medical history of either or both birth parents who are a party to the agreement.",
              "(l) The order approving a cooperative postadoption agreement shall be made part of the final order terminating parental rights. The finality of the termination of parental rights and of the adoption shall not be affected by implementation of the provisions of the postadoption agreement, nor is the cooperative postadoption contingent upon the finalization of an adoption. Such an agreement shall not affect the ability of the adoptive parents and the child to change their residence within or outside this state.",

(Name of child), a person under the age of eighteen years”, and shall set forth with specificity: (1) The name, sex, date and place of birth, and present address of the child; (2) the name and address of the petitioner, and the nature of the relationship between the petitioner and the child; (3) the names, dates of birth and addresses of the parents of the child, if known, including the name of any putative father named by the mother, and the tribe and reservation of an American Indian parent; (4) if the parent of the child is a minor, the names and addresses of the parents or guardian of the person of such minor; (5) the names and addresses of: (A) The guardian of the person of the child; (B) any guardians ad litem appointed in a prior proceeding; (C) the tribe and reservation of an American Indian child; and (D) the child-placing agency which placed the child in his current placement; (6) the facts upon which termination is sought, the legal grounds authorizing termination, the effects of a termination decree and the basis for the jurisdiction of the court; (7) the name of the persons or agencies which have agreed to accept custody or guardianship of the child's person upon disposition.\n\n(c) If the information required under subdivisions (2) and (6) of subsection (b) of this section is not stated, the petition shall be dismissed. If any other facts required under subdivision (1), (3), (4), (5) or (7) of subsection (b) of this section are not known or cannot be ascertained by the petitioner, he shall so state in the petition. If the whereabouts of either parent or the putative father named under subdivision (3) of subsection (b) of this section are unknown, the petitioner shall diligently search for any such parent or putative father. The petitioner shall file an affidavit with the petition indicating the efforts used to locate the parent or putative father.\n\n(d) If a petition indicates that either or both parents consent to the termination of their parental rights, or if at any time following the filing of a petition and before the entry of a decree a parent consents to the termination of his parental rights, each consenting parent shall acknowledge such consent on a form promulgated by the Office of the Chief Court Administrator evidencing to the satisfaction of the court that the parent has voluntarily and knowingly consented to the termination of his parental rights. No consent to termination by a mother shall be executed within forty-eight hours immediately after the birth of her child. A parent who is a minor shall have the right to consent to termination of parental rights and such consent shall not be voidable by reason of such minority. A guardian ad litem shall be appointed by the court to assure that such minor parent is giving an informed and voluntary consent.\n\n(e) A petition under this section shall be filed in the Probate Court for the district in which (1) the petitioner resides, (2) the child resides, is domiciled or is located at the time of the filing of the petition, or (3) in the case of a minor who is under the guardianship of any child care facility or child-placing agency, in the Probate Court for the district in which any office of the agency is located.

In addition to the provisions of this section, the Probate Court may, on the court's own motion or that of any interested party, transfer any termination of parental rights case to a Regional Children's Probate Court established pursuant to section 45a-8a . If the case is transferred, the clerk of the Probate Court shall transmit to the clerk of the Superior Court or the Regional Children's Probate Court to which the case was transferred, the original files and papers in the case.

Such an agreement may be entered into if: (1) An order terminating parental rights has not yet been entered; and (2) either or both birth parents agree to a voluntary termination of parental rights, including an agreement in a case which began as an involuntary termination of parental rights. The postadoption agreement shall be applicable only to a birth parent who is a party to the agreement. Such agreement shall be in addition to those under common law.

The finality of the termination of parental rights and of the adoption shall not be affected by implementation of the provisions of the postadoption agreement, nor is the cooperative postadoption contingent upon the finalization of an adoption. Such an agreement shall not affect the ability of the adoptive parents and the child to change their residence within or outside this state.\n\n(m) A disagreement between the parties or litigation brought to enforce or modify the agreement shall not affect the validity of the termination of parental rights or the adoption and shall not serve as a basis for orders affecting the custody of the child. The court shall not act on a petition to change or enforce the agreement unless the petitioner had participated, or attempted to participate, in good faith in mediation or other appropriate dispute resolution proceedings to resolve the dispute and allocate any cost for such mediation or dispute resolution proceedings.\n\n(n) An adoptive parent, guardian ad litem for the child or the court on its own motion may, at any time, petition for review of communication or contact ordered pursuant to subsection (i) of this section, if the adoptive parent believes that the best interests of the child are being compromised. The court may order the communication or contact be terminated, or order such conditions in regard to communication or contact as the court deems to be in the best interest of the adopted child.\n\n(o) For any child who is the subject of a petition for adoption under this chapter, the court shall consider the appropriateness of postadoption communication or contact with a sibling of such child, including, but not limited to, visitation, written correspondence or telephone calls. If the court determines such postadoption communication or contact is in the best interest of the child, the court shall order that such child have access to and visitation rights with such sibling until the child reaches eighteen years of age.\n\n(p) The court shall consider the following factors in determining whether postadoption communication or contact with a sibling is in the best interest of the child: (1) The age of the child and his or her sibling; (2) the extent of the existing relationship between the child and his or her sibling; (3) the physical, emotional and psychological needs, including any special needs, and stability of the child and his or her sibling; (4) the child's opinion and the opinion of his or her sibling regarding such postadoption communication or contact; (5) the opinion of the adoptive parent regarding such postadoption communication or contact; (6) opinions of experts, including any individuals who may have provided services to the child or his or her sibling; (7) the long-term plans for the child and his or her sibling; and (8) any relevant logistical concerns.\n\n(q) Any determination of the court pursuant to subsection (o) of this section shall be included in the final adoption order, but such determination shall not affect the validity of the adoption. Nothing in this subsection shall limit the authority of the court to enforce its orders in any manner permitted by law.\n\n(r) An adoptive parent may, at any time, petition the court to review its determination regarding postadoption communication or contact between a child and his or her sibling. Upon receiving such petition, the court shall conduct a review of its determination using the factors listed in subsection (p) of this section and may order the communication or contact to be terminated or modified if the court determines that such termination or modification is in the best interest of the child. If any dispute arises pursuant to such review, the court may order the parties to engage in mediation.\n\n(s) The court shall not, pursuant to the review required under subsection (r) of this section, increase communication or contact between the adopted child and his or her sibling unless the court (1) receives consent from the adoptive parent; and (2) inquires about and considers the opinion of the child regarding such increase.\n\nSee Sec. 17a-112 re termination of parental rights of child committed to Commissioner of Children and Families."

              "(a) At the hearing held on any petition for the termination of parental rights filed in the Probate Court under section 45a-715 , or filed in the Superior Court under section 17a-112 , or transferred to the Superior Court from the Probate Court under section 45a-715 , any party to whom notice was given shall have the right to appear and be heard with respect to the petition. If a parent who is consenting to the termination of such parent's parental rights appears at the hearing on the petition for termination of parental rights, the court shall explain to the parent the meaning and consequences of termination of parental rights. Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to require the appearance of a consenting parent at the hearing regarding the termination of such parent's parental rights except as otherwise provided by court order.",
              "(b) If a respondent parent appears without counsel, the court shall inform such respondent parent of his or her right to counsel and upon request, if he or she is unable to pay for counsel, shall appoint counsel to represent such respondent parent. No respondent parent may waive counsel unless the court has first explained the nature and meaning of a petition for the termination of parental rights. Unless the appointment of counsel is required under section 46b-136 , the court may appoint counsel to represent or appear on behalf of any child in a hearing held under this section to speak on behalf of the best interests of the child. If the respondent parent is unable to pay for his or her own counsel or if the child is unable to pay for the child's counsel, in the case of a Superior Court matter, the reasonable compensation of counsel appointed for the respondent parent or the child shall be established by, and paid from funds appropriated to, the Judicial Department and, in the case of a Probate Court matter, the reasonable compensation of counsel appointed for the respondent parent or the child shall be established by, and paid from funds appropriated to, the Judicial Department, however, in the case of a Probate Court matter, if funds have not been included in the budget of the Judicial Department for such purposes, such compensation shall be established by the Probate Court Administrator and paid from the Probate Court Administration Fund.",
              "(c) The court shall, if a claim for parentage has been filed by an alleged genetic parent in accordance with section 46b-571 , continue the hearing under the provisions of this section until the claim for parentage is adjudicated, provided the court may combine the hearing on the claim for parentage with the hearing on the termination of parental rights petition.",
              "(d) Upon finding at the hearing or at any time during the pendency of the petition that reasonable cause exists to warrant an examination, the court, on its own motion or on motion by any party, may order the child to be examined at a suitable place by a physician, psychiatrist or licensed clinical psychologist appointed by the court. The court may also order examination of a parent or custodian whose competency or ability to care for a child before the court is at issue. The expense of any examination shall be paid for by the petitioner, respondent or the party who requested the examination in such proportion as the court determines. If a party responsible for payment is indigent, such party's share of the expense shall be paid for by funds appropriated to the Judicial Department, however, in the case of a Probate Court matter, if funds have not been included in the budget of the Judicial Department for such purposes, the compensation of the physician, psychiatrist or psychologist shall be established by the Probate Court Administrator and paid from the Probate Court Administration Fund. The court may consider the results of the examinations in ruling on the merits of the petition.",
              "(e) (1) The court may, and in any contested case shall, request the Commissioner of Children and Families or any child-placing agency licensed by the commissioner to make an investigation and written report to it, within ninety days from the receipt of such request. The report shall indicate the physical, mental and emotional status of the child and shall contain such facts as may be relevant to the court's determination of whether the proposed termination of parental rights will be in the best interests of the child, including the physical, mental, social and financial condition of the biological parents, and any other factors which the commissioner or such child-placing agency finds relevant to the court's determination of whether the proposed termination will be in the best interests of the child. (2) If such a report has been requested, upon the expiration of such ninety-day period or upon receipt of the report, whichever is earlier, the court shall set a day for a hearing not more than thirty days thereafter. The court shall give reasonable notice of such adjourned hearing to all parties to the first hearing, and to such other persons as the court shall deem appropriate. (3) The report shall be admissible in evidence, subject to the right of a party to require that the person making it appear as a witness and be subject to examination.",
              "(f) At the adjourned hearing or at the initial hearing where no investigation and report has been requested, the court may approve a petition for termination of parental rights based on consent filed pursuant to this section terminating the parental rights and may appoint a guardian of the person of the child, or if the petitioner requests, the court may appoint a statutory parent, if it finds, upon clear and convincing evidence that (1) the termination is in the best interest of the child, and (2) such parent has voluntarily and knowingly consented to termination of the parent's parental rights with respect to such child. If the court denies a petition for termination of parental rights based on consent, it may refer the matter to an agency to assess the needs of the child, the care the child is receiving and the plan of the parent for the child. Consent for the termination of the parental right of one parent does not diminish the parental rights of the other parent of the child nor does it relieve the other parent of the duty to support the child.",

Nonaccidental or inadequately explained serious physical injury to a child shall constitute prima facie evidence of acts of parental commission or omission sufficient for the termination of parental rights; (C) there is no ongoing parent-child relationship which is defined as the relationship that ordinarily develops as a result of a parent having met on a continuing, day-to-day basis the physical, emotional, moral and educational needs of the child and to allow further time for the establishment or reestablishment of the parent-child relationship would be detrimental to the best interests of the child; (D) a child of the parent (i) was found by the Superior Court or the Probate Court to have been neglected, abused or uncared for, as those terms are defined in section 46b-120 , in a prior proceeding, or (ii) is found to be neglected, abused or uncared for and has been in the custody of the commissioner for at least fifteen months and such parent has been provided specific steps to take to facilitate the return of the child to the parent pursuant to section 46b-129 and has failed to achieve such degree of personal rehabilitation as would encourage the belief that within a reasonable time, considering the age and needs of the child, such parent could assume a responsible position in the life of the child; (E) a child of the parent, who is under the age of seven years is found to be neglected, abused or uncared for, and the parent has failed, is unable or is unwilling to achieve such degree of personal rehabilitation as would encourage the belief that within a reasonable amount of time, considering the age and needs of the child, such parent could assume a responsible position in the life of the child and such parent's parental rights of another child were previously terminated pursuant to a petition filed by the Commissioner of Children and Families; (F) the parent has killed through deliberate, nonaccidental act another child of the parent or has requested, commanded, importuned, attempted, conspired or solicited such killing or has committed an assault, through deliberate, nonaccidental act that resulted in serious bodily injury of another child of the parent; (G) except as provided in subsection (h) of this section, the parent committed an act that constitutes sexual assault as described in section 53a-70 , 53a-70a , 53a-70c , 53a-71 , 53a-72a , 53a-72b or 53a-73a or compelling a spouse or cohabitor to engage in sexual intercourse by the use of force or by the threat of the use of force as described in section 53a-70b of the general statutes, revision of 1958, revised to January 1, 2019, if such act resulted in the conception of the child; or (H) the parent was finally adjudged guilty of sexual assault under section 53a-70 , 53a-70a , 53a-70c , 53a-71 , 53a-72a , 53a-72b or 53a-73a or of compelling a spouse or cohabitor to engage in sexual intercourse by the use of force or by the threat of the use of force under section 53a-70b of the general statutes, revision of 1958, revised to January 1, 2019, if such act resulted in the conception of the child.",
              "(h) If the petition alleges an act described in subparagraph (G) of subdivision (2) of subsection (g) of this section that resulted in the conception of the child as a basis for termination of parental rights and the court determines that the respondent parent was finally adjudged not guilty of such act of sexual assault under section 53a-70 , 53a-70a , 53a-70c , 53a-71 , 53a-72a , 53a-72b or 53a-73 or of compelling a spouse or cohabitor to engage in sexual intercourse by the use of force or by the threat of the use of force under section 53a-70b of the general statutes, revision of 1958, revised to January 1, 2019, the court shall transfer the case to the Superior Court and the clerk of the Probate Court shall transmit to the clerk of the Superior Court to which the case was transferred, the original files and papers in the case. The Superior Court, upon hearing after notice as provided in this section and section 45a-716 , may grant the petition as provided in this section.",
              "(i) Except in the case where termination is based on consent, in determining whether to terminate parental rights under this section, the court shall consider and shall make written findings regarding: (1) The timeliness, nature and extent of services offered, provided and made available to the parent and the child by a child-placing agency to facilitate the reunion of the child with the parent; (2) the terms of any applicable court order entered into and agreed upon by any individual or child-placing agency and the parent, and the extent to which all parties have fulfilled their obligations under such order; (3) the feelings and emotional ties of the child with respect to the child's parents, any guardian of the child's person and any person who has exercised physical care, custody or control of the child for at least one year and with whom the child has developed significant emotional ties; (4) the age of the child; (5) the efforts the parent has made to adjust such parent's circumstances, conduct or conditions to make it in the best interest of the child to return the child to the parent's home in the foreseeable future, including, but not limited to, (A) the extent to which the parent has maintained contact with the child as part of an effort to reunite the child with the parent, provided the court may give weight to incidental visitations, communications or contributions and (B) the maintenance of regular contact or communication with the guardian or other custodian of the child; and (6) the extent to which a parent has been prevented from maintaining a meaningful relationship with the child by the unreasonable act or conduct of the other parent of the child, or the unreasonable act of any other person or by the economic circumstances of the parent.",
              "(j) If the parental rights of only one parent are terminated, the remaining parent shall be sole parent and, unless otherwise provided by law, guardian of the person.",
              "(k) In the case where termination of parental rights is granted, the guardian of the person or statutory parent shall report to the court within thirty days of the date judgment is entered on a case plan, as defined by the federal Adoption and Safe Families Act of 1997, as amended from time to time, for the child. At least every three months thereafter, such guardian or statutory parent shall make a report to the court on the implementation of the plan. The court may convene a hearing upon the filing of a report and shall convene a hearing for the purpose of reviewing the plan no more than twelve months from the date judgment is entered or from the date of the last permanency hearing held pursuant to subsection (k) of section 46b-129 if the child or youth is in the care and custody of the Commissioner of Children and Families, whichever is earlier, and at least once a year thereafter until such time as any proposed adoption plan has become finalized. If the Commissioner of Children and Families is the statutory parent for the child, at such a hearing the court shall determine whether the department has made reasonable efforts to achieve the permanency plan. In the case where termination of parental rights is granted, the guardian of the person or statutory parent shall obtain the approval of the court prior to placing the child or youth for adoption outside the state. Before ordering or approving such placement, the court shall make findings concerning compliance with the provisions of section 17a-175 . Such findings shall include, but not be limited to: (1) A finding that the state has received notice in writing from the receiving state, in accordance with subsection (d) of Article III of section 17a-175 , indicating that the proposed placement does not appear contrary to the interests of the child, (2) the court has reviewed such notice, (3) whether or not an interstate compact study or other home study has been completed by the receiving state, and (4) if such a study has been completed, whether the conclusions reached by the receiving state as a result of such study support the placement.",

(C) because child had no emotional bond with respondent whom he had never seen and about whom he was not aware and it would be detrimental to child's best interests to allow time for such a relationship to develop since child perceives his mother, stepfather and half-sisters as his family and respondent is likely to be incarcerated for several additional years. 120 CA 465. Subdiv. (2)(A) does not contemplate a sporadic showing of the indicia of interest, concern or responsibility for the welfare of a child, and a parent must maintain a reasonable degree of interest in the welfare of his or her child; the term “maintain” implies a continuing, reasonable degree of concern. Id., 712. Because the language in Subdiv. (2)(D) is virtually identical to that in Sec. 17a-112(j)(3)(B), the meaning and analytical framework applicable to that section applies to Subdiv. (2)(D). 134 CA 1. A parent who fails to provide the care, guidance or control necessary for child's well-being as contemplated under Subdiv. (2)(B) is not exempt from the provisions of Subsec. simply because some other person provides such care, guidance or control during parent's absence. 158 CA 154. Subdiv. (2): State's interest in preserving family integrity is the same regardless of whether party seeking termination of an individual's parental rights is the commissioner or the custodial parent; parent petitioning for termination of respondent parent's parental rights cannot establish lack of ongoing parent-child relationship on basis of petitioning parent's own interference with respondent parent's efforts to maintain contact with child. 167 CA 248. Subdiv. (2): A court cannot find both than an ongoing parent-child relationship exists and that a custodial parent prevented one from existing. 178 CA 215. Subdiv. (2): The initial test for determining whether an ongoing parent-child relationship exists is whether the child has any present positive feelings for the parent; a trial court may consider the question of interference only if the child does not have such feelings. Id. Subdiv. (2)(B): Circumstances of the termination of respondent's parental rights to other children in other actions are separate and distinct from those as to the child in current action and collateral estoppel cannot apply to preclude respondent from litigating whether his abuse of other children resulted in the denial of care, guidance, or control necessary for the physical, educational, moral, or emotional well-being of child in current action. 180 CA 132."

If a parent who is consenting to the termination of such parent's parental rights appears at the hearing on the petition for termination of parental rights, the court shall explain to the parent the meaning and consequences of termination of parental rights. Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to require the appearance of a consenting parent at the hearing regarding the termination of such parent's parental rights except as otherwise provided by court order.\n\n(b) If a respondent parent appears without counsel, the court shall inform such respondent parent of his or her right to counsel and upon request, if he or she is unable to pay for counsel, shall appoint counsel to represent such respondent parent. No respondent parent may waive counsel unless the court has first explained the nature and meaning of a petition for the termination of parental rights. Unless the appointment of counsel is required under section 46b-136 , the court may appoint counsel to represent or appear on behalf of any child in a hearing held under this section to speak on behalf of the best interests of the child.

The court may also order examination of a parent or custodian whose competency or ability to care for a child before the court is at issue. The expense of any examination shall be paid for by the petitioner, respondent or the party who requested the examination in such proportion as the court determines. If a party responsible for payment is indigent, such party's share of the expense shall be paid for by funds appropriated to the Judicial Department, however, in the case of a Probate Court matter, if funds have not been included in the budget of the Judicial Department for such purposes, the compensation of the physician, psychiatrist or psychologist shall be established by the Probate Court Administrator and paid from the Probate Court Administration Fund. The court may consider the results of the examinations in ruling on the merits of the petition.\n\n(e) (1) The court may, and in any contested case shall, request the Commissioner of Children and Families or any child-placing agency licensed by the commissioner to make an investigation and written report to it, within ninety days from the receipt of such request. The report shall indicate the physical, mental and emotional status of the child and shall contain such facts as may be relevant to the court's determination of whether the proposed termination of parental rights will be in the best interests of the child, including the physical, mental, social and financial condition of the biological parents, and any other factors which the commissioner or such child-placing agency finds relevant to the court's determination of whether the proposed termination will be in the best interests of the child. (2) If such a report has been requested, upon the expiration of such ninety-day period or upon receipt of the report, whichever is earlier, the court shall set a day for a hearing not more than thirty days thereafter. The court shall give reasonable notice of such adjourned hearing to all parties to the first hearing, and to such other persons as the court shall deem appropriate. (3) The report shall be admissible in evidence, subject to the right of a party to require that the person making it appear as a witness and be subject to examination.\n\n(f) At the adjourned hearing or at the initial hearing where no investigation and report has been requested, the court may approve a petition for termination of parental rights based on consent filed pursuant to this section terminating the parental rights and may appoint a guardian of the person of the child, or if the petitioner requests, the court may appoint a statutory parent, if it finds, upon clear and convincing evidence that (1) the termination is in the best interest of the child, and (2) such parent has voluntarily and knowingly consented to termination of the parent's parental rights with respect to such child. If the court denies a petition for termination of parental rights based on consent, it may refer the matter to an agency to assess the needs of the child, the care the child is receiving and the plan of the parent for the child. Consent for the termination of the parental right of one parent does not diminish the parental rights of the other parent of the child nor does it relieve the other parent of the duty to support the child.\n\n(g) At the adjourned hearing or at the initial hearing where no investigation and report has been requested, the court may approve a petition terminating the parental rights and may appoint a guardian of the person of the child, or, if the petitioner requests, the court may appoint a statutory parent, if it finds, upon clear and convincing evidence, that (1) the termination is in the best interest of the child, and (2) (A) the child has been abandoned by the parent in the sense that the parent has failed to maintain a reasonable degree of interest, concern or responsibility as to the welfare of the child; (B) the child has been denied, by reason of an act or acts of parental commission or omission, including, but not limited to, sexual molestation and exploitation, severe physical abuse or a pattern of abuse, the care, guidance or control necessary for the child's physical, educational, moral or emotional well-being. Nonaccidental or inadequately explained serious physical injury to a child shall constitute prima facie evidence of acts of parental commission or omission sufficient for the termination of parental rights; (C) there is no ongoing parent-child relationship which is defined as the relationship that ordinarily develops as a result of a parent having met on a continuing, day-to-day basis the physical, emotional, moral and educational needs of the child and to allow further time for the establishment or reestablishment of the parent-child relationship would be detrimental to the best interests of the child; (D) a child of the parent (i) was found by the Superior Court or the Probate Court to have been neglected, abused or uncared for, as those terms are defined in section 46b-120 , in a prior proceeding, or (ii) is found to be neglected, abused or uncared for and has been in the custody of the commissioner for at least fifteen months and such parent has been provided specific steps to take to facilitate the return of the child to the parent pursuant to section 46b-129 and has failed to achieve such degree of personal rehabilitation as would encourage the belief that within a reasonable time, considering the age and needs of the child, such parent could assume a responsible position in the life of the child; (E) a child of the parent, who is under the age of seven years is found to be neglected, abused or uncared for, and the parent has failed, is unable or is unwilling to achieve such degree of personal rehabilitation as would encourage the belief that within a reasonable amount of time, considering the age and needs of the child, such parent could assume a responsible position in the life of the child and such parent's parental rights of another child were previously terminated pursuant to a petition filed by the Commissioner of Children and Families; (F) the parent has killed through deliberate, nonaccidental act another child of the parent or has requested, commanded, importuned, attempted, conspired or solicited such killing or has committed an assault, through deliberate, nonaccidental act that resulted in serious bodily injury of another child of the parent; (G) except as provided in subsection (h) of this section, the parent committed an act that constitutes sexual assault as described in section 53a-70 , 53a-70a , 53a-70c , 53a-71 , 53a-72a , 53a-72b or 53a-73a or compelling a spouse or cohabitor to engage in sexual intercourse by the use of force or by the threat of the use of force as described in section 53a-70b of the general statutes, revision of 1958, revised to January 1, 2019, if such act resulted in the conception of the child; or (H) the parent was finally adjudged guilty of sexual assault under section 53a-70 , 53a-70a , 53a-70c , 53a-71 , 53a-72a , 53a-72b or 53a-73a or of compelling a spouse or cohabitor to engage in sexual intercourse by the use of force or by the threat of the use of force under section 53a-70b of the general statutes, revision of 1958, revised to January 1, 2019, if such act resulted in the conception of the child.\n\n(h) If the petition alleges an act described in subparagraph (G) of subdivision (2) of subsection (g) of this section that resulted in the conception of the child as a basis for termination of parental rights and the court determines that the respondent parent was finally adjudged not guilty of such act of sexual assault under section 53a-70 , 53a-70a , 53a-70c , 53a-71 , 53a-72a , 53a-72b or 53a-73 or of compelling a spouse or cohabitor to engage in sexual intercourse by the use of force or by the threat of the use of force under section 53a-70b of the general statutes, revision of 1958, revised to January 1, 2019, the court shall transfer the case to the Superior Court and the clerk of the Probate Court shall transmit to the clerk of the Superior Court to which the case was transferred, the original files and papers in the case. The Superior Court, upon hearing after notice as provided in this section and section 45a-716 , may grant the petition as provided in this section.\n\n(i) Except in the case where termination is based on consent, in determining whether to terminate parental rights under this section, the court shall consider and shall make written findings regarding: (1) The timeliness, nature and extent of services offered, provided and made available to the parent and the child by a child-placing agency to facilitate the reunion of the child with the parent; (2) the terms of any applicable court order entered into and agreed upon by any individual or child-placing agency and the parent, and the extent to which all parties have fulfilled their obligations under such order; (3) the feelings and emotional ties of the child with respect to the child's parents, any guardian of the child's person and any person who has exercised physical care, custody or control of the child for at least one year and with whom the child has developed significant emotional ties; (4) the age of the child; (5) the efforts the parent has made to adjust such parent's circumstances, conduct or conditions to make it in the best interest of the child to return the child to the parent's home in the foreseeable future, including, but not limited to, (A) the extent to which the parent has maintained contact with the child as part of an effort to reunite the child with the parent, provided the court may give weight to incidental visitations, communications or contributions and (B) the maintenance of regular contact or communication with the guardian or other custodian of the child; and (6) the extent to which a parent has been prevented from maintaining a meaningful relationship with the child by the unreasonable act or conduct of the other parent of the child, or the unreasonable act of any other person or by the economic circumstances of the parent.\n\n(j) If the parental rights of only one parent are terminated, the remaining parent shall be sole parent and, unless otherwise provided by law, guardian of the person.\n\n(k) In the case where termination of parental rights is granted, the guardian of the person or statutory parent shall report to the court within thirty days of the date judgment is entered on a case plan, as defined by the federal Adoption and Safe Families Act of 1997, as amended from time to time, for the child. At least every three months thereafter, such guardian or statutory parent shall make a report to the court on the implementation of the plan. The court may convene a hearing upon the filing of a report and shall convene a hearing for the purpose of reviewing the plan no more than twelve months from the date judgment is entered or from the date of the last permanency hearing held pursuant to subsection (k) of section 46b-129 if the child or youth is in the care and custody of the Commissioner of Children and Families, whichever is earlier, and at least once a year thereafter until such time as any proposed adoption plan has become finalized. If the Commissioner of Children and Families is the statutory parent for the child, at such a hearing the court shall determine whether the department has made reasonable efforts to achieve the permanency plan. In the case where termination of parental rights is granted, the guardian of the person or statutory parent shall obtain the approval of the court prior to placing the child or youth for adoption outside the state. Before ordering or approving such placement, the court shall make findings concerning compliance with the provisions of section 17a-175 . Such findings shall include, but not be limited to: (1) A finding that the state has received notice in writing from the receiving state, in accordance with subsection (d) of Article III of section 17a-175 , indicating that the proposed placement does not appear contrary to the interests of the child, (2) the court has reviewed such notice, (3) whether or not an interstate compact study or other home study has been completed by the receiving state, and (4) if such a study has been completed, whether the conclusions reached by the receiving state as a result of such study support the placement.\n\nSee Sec. 17a-112 re termination of parental rights of child committed to Commissioner of Children and Families."
