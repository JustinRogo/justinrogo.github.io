              "(a) If, in the exercise of the Commissioner of Energy and Environmental Protection's powers pursuant to this title, the commissioner finds that the use of a certain technology, product or process would promote energy conservation, energy efficiency or renewable energy technology, the commissioner may direct a state agency to test such technology, product or process by using it in the operations of such agency on a trial basis. The purpose of such test program shall be to validate the effectiveness of such technology, product or process in reducing energy usage and costs or reducing dependence on fossil fuels or green house gas emissions.",
              "(b) (1) The Commissioner of Energy and Environmental Protection shall administer pilot test programs at state agencies for the use of technologies, products or processes that promote energy conservation, energy efficiency or renewable energy. The purpose of such test programs shall be to validate the effectiveness of such technologies, products or processes in reducing energy usage and costs or reducing dependence on fossil fuels or greenhouse gas emissions.",

              "(c) (1) The Commissioner of Energy and Environmental Protection may direct a state agency to test any such technology, product or process identified by the commissioner. Alternatively, the commissioner of a state agency may file a request with the Commissioner of Energy and Environmental Protection for approval to test any such technology, product or process identified by such state agency commissioner. Not later than thirty days after receipt of any such request, the Commissioner of Energy and Environmental Protection shall evaluate the technology, product or process and approve or disapprove the state agency commissioner's request. A state agency that is directed to test, or receives approval to test, any such technology, product or process shall use it in the operations of such agency on a trial basis as prescribed by the commissioner.",
              "(2) No agency shall undertake such testing of any technology, product or process unless the business manufacturing or marketing the technology, product or process demonstrates that (A) the use of such technology, product or process by the state agency will not adversely affect safety, (B) a certified independent third party or accredited laboratory has found that the technology, product or process reduces energy consumption and cost, and (C) the technology, product or process is presently available for commercial sale and distribution or has potential for commercialization not later than two years following the completion of any test program by a state agency pursuant to this section.",
              "(3) If the commissioner of the state agency testing such technology, product or process determines that the test program sufficiently demonstrates that the technology, product or process reduces energy usage and costs or reduces dependence on fossil fuels or greenhouse gas emissions, such testing agency may request that the Commissioner of Administrative Services (A) procure such technology for use by any or all state agencies, and (B) make such procurement pursuant to subsection (b) of section 4a-58 .",

Any costs associated with the acquisition and use of such technology, product or process by the testing agency for the test period shall be borne by the manufacturer, the marketer or any investor or participant in such business. The acquisition of any technology, product or process for purposes of the test program established pursuant to this section shall not be deemed to be a purchase under the provisions of state procurement law. The manufacturer, the marketer or any investor or participant in such business shall maintain records related to such test program, as required by the commissioner. All proprietary information derived from such test program shall be exempt from the provisions of subsection (a) of section 1-210 .",

The person filing the petition shall be subject to the penalty for making a false statement under section 53a-157b .\n\n(2) The commissioner may grant an exemption to any person who due to certain circumstances is unable to comply with such order without suffering inordinate hardship beyond that hardship suffered by persons generally, including, but not limited to, circumstances where in the absence of such exemption the petitioner would: (A) Be prevented from performing activities essential to the pursuit of his regular occupation or profession, (B) suffer adverse medical effects or be unable to obtain necessary medical treatment, or (C) incur permanent and substantial injury to person or property. The commissioner may also grant an exemption to any person who performs an essential public service and who would be prevented from performing such service or would be impaired in his performance in the absence of such exemption.\n\n(3) In making a determination pursuant to this subsection, the commissioner may compare the relevant circumstances of the petitioner with (A) other users of the same fuel, users of other fuels, or both, or (B) other persons in the same economic sector or subsector, persons in other economic sectors or subsectors, or both, as determined by the commissioner to be most appropriate in terms of the specific energy resource availability situation existing or forecast at the time such comparison is made.\n\n(b) The commissioner may investigate any such petition and consider in his decision any relevant factual finding resulting from such investigation. The commissioner may accept submissions from third parties relevant to such petition, provided the petitioner is afforded the opportunity to respond to such third party submissions. The commissioner may also consider any other sources of relevant information in deciding the petition before him. The commissioner may hold an informal hearing, if, in his opinion, such hearing is advisable.\n\n(c) If the commissioner determines that there is insufficient information upon which to base a decision and if upon request the required additional information is not furnished, the petition may be dismissed without prejudice. The commissioner shall grant, deny or dismiss without prejudice such petition not more than thirty days after receipt of such petition. The commissioner may make his decision granting an exemption conditional upon the petitioner's taking actions specified in such decision. Upon the granting, denying or dismissal of such petition, the commissioner shall notify the petitioner, in writing, the reasons for his decision.\n\n(d) The commissioner may reconsider and alter any decision under this section as he deems necessary to implement such plan, or any provision of such plan or any order adopted pursuant to section 16a-11 or 16a-12 . The commissioner may suspend or revoke any exemption for any reason including but not limited to: (1) Changed circumstances where the grounds for granting an exemption to the petitioner have ceased to exist, (2) failure on the part of the petitioner to comply with conditions specified in the commissioner's decision granting the exemption, or (3) where the exemption was issued by mistake or on the basis of misrepresentation or false pretenses on the part of the petitioner.\n\n(e) The provisions of sections 4-176e to 4-181a , inclusive, shall not apply to any proceeding held pursuant to subsections (a) to (d), inclusive, of this section.

              "The General Assembly finds that the state of Connecticut is severely disadvantaged by its lack of primary energy resources; that primarily as a result of past policies and tendencies, the state has become dependent upon petroleum as an energy source; that national energy policies do not preclude the recurrence of serious problems arising from this dependence during petroleum shortages; that the increase in oil prices since the 1973 oil embargo has had a major impact on the state; that the economy has suffered directly because of our dependence on petroleum and constraints upon the rate of conversion to alternatives; that other conventional sources of energy are subject to constraints involving supply, transportation, cost and environmental, health and safety considerations; and that the state must address these problems by conserving energy, increasing the efficiency of energy utilization and developing renewable energy sources. The General Assembly further finds that energy use has a profound impact on the society, economy and environment of the state, particularly in its impact on low and moderate-income households and interrelationship with population growth, high density urbanization, industrial well-being, resource utilization, technological development and social advancement, and that energy is critically important to the overall welfare and development of our society. Therefore, the General Assembly declares that it is the policy of the state of Connecticut to (1) conserve energy resources by avoiding unnecessary and wasteful consumption; (2) consume energy resources in the most efficient manner feasible; (3) develop and utilize renewable energy resources, such as solar and wind energy, to the maximum practicable extent; (4) diversify the state's energy supply mix; (5) where practicable, replace energy resources vulnerable to interruption due to circumstances beyond the state's control with those less vulnerable; (6) assist citizens and businesses in implementing measures to reduce energy consumption and costs; (7) ensure that low-income households can meet essential energy needs; (8) maintain planning and preparedness capabilities necessary to deal effectively with future energy supply interruptions; and (9) when available energy alternatives are equivalent, give preference for capacity additions first to conservation and load management. The state shall seek all possible ways to implement this policy through public education and cooperative efforts involving the federal government, regional organizations, municipal governments, other public and private organizations and concerned individuals, using all practical means and measures, including financial and technical assistance, in a manner calculated to promote the general welfare by creating and maintaining conditions under which energy can be utilized effectively and efficiently. The General Assembly further declares that it is the continuing responsibility of the state to use all means consistent with other essential considerations of state policy to improve and coordinate the plans, functions, programs and resources of the state to attain the objectives stated herein without harm to the environment, risk to health or safety or other undesirable or unintended consequences, to preserve wherever possible a society which supports a diversity and variety of individual choice, to achieve a balance between population and resource use which will permit the maintenance of adequate living standards and a sharing of life's amenities among all citizens, and to enhance the utilization of renewable resources so that the availability of nonrenewable resources can be extended to future generations.

              "(f) Not later than August first, annually, the commissioner shall calculate the difference between (1) the weighted average of the percentage rates of interest payable on all subsidized loans made (A) after July 1, 1982, from the Energy Conservation Loan Fund, and (B) from the Housing Repayment and Revolving Loan Fund pursuant to this section, and (2) the average of the percentage rates of interest on any bonds and notes issued pursuant to section 3-20 , which have been dedicated to the energy conservation loan program and used to fund such loans, and multiply such difference by the outstanding amount of all such loans, or such lesser amount as may be required under Section 103(c) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, or any subsequent corresponding internal revenue code of the United States, as from time to time amended. The product of such difference and such applicable amount shall not exceed six per cent of the sum of the outstanding principal amount at the end of each fiscal year of all loans or deferred loans made (A) on or after July 1, 1982, from the Energy Conservation Loan Fund, and (B) from the Housing Repayment and Revolving Loan Fund pursuant to this section, and the balance remaining in the Energy Conservation Loan Fund and the balance of energy conservation loan repayments in the Housing Repayment and Revolving Loan Fund.

Not later than October first, annually, each such company shall pay its assessed amount to the commissioner. The commissioner shall pay to the State Treasurer for deposit in the General Fund all such payments from electric distribution and gas companies, and shall adopt procedures to assure that such payments are not used for purposes other than those specifically provided in this section. The authority shall include each company's payment as an operating expense of the company for the purposes of rate-making under section 16-19 ."

In the purchase and installation of insulation in new residential structures, only that insulation which exceeds the requirements of the State Building Code shall be eligible for such loans or deferred loans. The commissioner may also make low-cost loans or deferred loans to persons in the state residing in dwellings constructed not later than December 31, 1995, and for which the primary source of heating since such date has been electric resistance, for (1) the purchase and installation of a high-efficiency secondary heating system using a source of heat other than electric resistance, (2) the conversion of a primary electric heating system to a high-efficiency system using a source of heat other than electric resistance, or (3) the purchase and installation of a high-efficiency combination heating and cooling system. As used in this subsection, “high-efficiency” means having a seasonal energy efficiency ratio of 11.0 or higher, or a heating season performance factor of 7.2 or higher, as designated by the American Refrigeration Institute in the Directory of Certified Unitary Air Conditioners, Air Source Heat Pumps and Outdoor Unitary Equipment, as from time to time amended, or an equivalent ratio for a fossil fuel system.\n\n(b) Any such loan or deferred loan shall be available only for a residential structure containing not more than four dwelling units, shall be not less than four hundred dollars and not more than twenty-five thousand dollars per structure and, with respect to any application received on or after November 29, 1979, shall be made only to an applicant who submits evidence, satisfactory to the commissioner, that the adjusted gross income of the household member or members who contribute to the support of his household was not in excess of one hundred ten per cent of the median area income by household size. In the case of a deferred loan, the contract shall require that payments on interest are due immediately but that payments on principal may be made at a later time. Repayment of loans made under this subsection shall be subject to (1) a rate of interest (A) of zero per cent for loans for natural gas furnaces or boilers that meet or exceed federal Energy Star standards and propane and oil furnaces and boilers that are not less than eighty-four per cent efficient or as may otherwise be provided in subsection (a) of section 16a-46e , or (B) to be determined in accordance with subsection (t) of section 3-20 and this subsection for loans for other purposes, and (2) such terms and conditions as the commissioner may establish. The State Bond Commission shall establish a range of rates of interest payable on loans pursuant to subparagraph (B) of subdivision (1) of this subsection and shall apply the range to applicants in accordance with a formula which reflects their income. Such range shall be not less than zero per cent for any applicant in the lowest income class and not more than one per cent above the rate of interest borne by the general obligation bonds of the state last issued prior to the most recent date such range was established for any applicant for whom the adjusted gross income of the household member or members who contribute to the support of his household does not exceed one hundred ten per cent of the median area income by household size.\n\n(c) The commissioner shall establish a program under which he shall make funds deposited in the Energy Conservation Loan Fund available for low-cost loans or deferred loans under subsection (a) of this section for residential structures containing more than four dwelling units, or for contracts guaranteeing payment of loans or deferred loans provided by private institutions for such structures for the purposes specified under subsection (a) of this section. Any such loan or deferred loan shall be an amount equaling not more than three thousand five hundred dollars multiplied by the number of dwelling units in such structure, provided no such loan or deferred loan shall exceed one hundred thousand dollars. If the applicant seeks a loan or deferred loan for a structure containing more than thirty dwelling units, he shall include in his application a commitment to make comparable energy improvements of benefit to all dwelling units in the structure in addition to the thirty units which are eligible for the loan or deferred loan. Applications for contracts of guarantee shall be limited to structures containing not more than thirty dwelling units and the amount of the guarantee shall be not more than three thousand dollars for each dwelling unit benefiting from the loan or deferred loan. There shall not be an income eligibility limitation for applicants for such loans, deferred loans or guarantees, but the commissioner shall give preference to applications for loans, deferred loans or guarantees for such structures which are occupied by persons of low or moderate income. Repayment of such loans or deferred loans shall be subject to (1) a rate of interest (A) of zero per cent for loans for natural gas furnaces or boilers that meet or exceed federal Energy Star standards and propane and oil furnaces and boilers that are not less than eighty-four per cent efficient or as may otherwise be provided in subsection (a) of section 16a-46e , or (B) to be determined in accordance with subsection (t) of section 3-20 for loans for other purposes, and (2) such terms and conditions as the commissioner shall establish. The state shall have a lien on each property for which a loan, deferred loan or guarantee has been made under this section to ensure compliance with such terms and conditions.\n\n(d) With respect to such loans made on or after July 1, 1981, all repayments of principal shall be deposited into the Energy Conservation Loan Fund established pursuant to section 16a-40a . The interest applicable to any such loans made shall be paid to the State Treasurer for deposit in the General Fund.\n\n(e) The commissioner shall adopt regulations in accordance with chapter 54, (1) concerning qualifications for such loans or deferred loans, requirements and limitations as to adjustments of terms and conditions of repayment and any additional requirements deemed necessary to carry out the provisions of this section and to assure that those tax-exempt bonds and notes used to fund such loans or deferred loans qualify for exemption from federal income taxation, (2) providing for the maximum feasible availability of such loans or deferred loans for dwelling units owned or occupied by persons of low and moderate income, (3) establishing procedures to inform such persons of the availability of such loans or deferred loans and to encourage and assist them to apply for such loans or deferred loans, and (4) providing that (A) the interest payments received from the recipients of loans or deferred loans made on and after July 1, 1982, less the expenses incurred by the commissioner in the implementation of the program of loans, deferred loans and loan guarantees under this section, and (B) the payments received from electric distribution and gas companies under subsection (f) of this section shall be applied to reimburse the General Fund for interest on the outstanding bonds and notes used to fund such loans or deferred loans made on or after July 1, 1982.\n\n(f) Not later than August first, annually, the commissioner shall calculate the difference between (1) the weighted average of the percentage rates of interest payable on all subsidized loans made (A) after July 1, 1982, from the Energy Conservation Loan Fund, and (B) from the Housing Repayment and Revolving Loan Fund pursuant to this section, and (2) the average of the percentage rates of interest on any bonds and notes issued pursuant to section 3-20 , which have been dedicated to the energy conservation loan program and used to fund such loans, and multiply such difference by the outstanding amount of all such loans, or such lesser amount as may be required under Section 103(c) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, or any subsequent corresponding internal revenue code of the United States, as from time to time amended. The product of such difference and such applicable amount shall not exceed six per cent of the sum of the outstanding principal amount at the end of each fiscal year of all loans or deferred loans made (A) on or after July 1, 1982, from the Energy Conservation Loan Fund, and (B) from the Housing Repayment and Revolving Loan Fund pursuant to this section, and the balance remaining in the Energy Conservation Loan Fund and the balance of energy conservation loan repayments in the Housing Repayment and Revolving Loan Fund. Not later than September first, annually, the Public Utilities Regulatory Authority shall allocate such product among each electric distribution and gas company having at least seventy-five thousand customers, in accordance with a formula taking into account, without limitation, the average number of residential customers of each company. Not later than October first, annually, each such company shall pay its assessed amount to the commissioner. The commissioner shall pay to the State Treasurer for deposit in the General Fund all such payments from electric distribution and gas companies, and shall adopt procedures to assure that such payments are not used for purposes other than those specifically provided in this section. The authority shall include each company's payment as an operating expense of the company for the purposes of rate-making under section 16-19 ."

Qualifying projects selected pursuant to this subsection shall be eligible to continue the terms of the pilot program for a period of ten years from the time the project is placed into service.\n\n(d) A qualifying project selected to participate in the pilot program shall not be required to pay the demand charges pursuant to the distribution demand-ratchet provision of firm service due to an outage of service of such project. If a qualifying project that participates in the pilot program has an outage of service, the only demand charge that shall be assessed by an electric distribution company shall be based on daily demand pricing prorated from standard monthly rates, provided, however, that if the outage of service lasts for less than three hours, no demand charge shall be assessed by an electric distribution company.\n\n(e) Any qualifying project that participates in the pilot program shall provide to the Public Utilities Regulatory Authority and the Commissioner of Energy and Environmental Protection all system performance and supplemental utility data that the authority shall, in its reasonable discretion, deem to be appropriate for measuring the performance of the pilot program. Such data shall consist of (1) net electrical production from the qualifying project, measured in kilowatt-hours per fifteen minute interval, (2) net thermal production from the qualifying project, measured in million BTU per fifteen minute interval, (3) fuel consumed by the qualifying facility, measured in million BTU per fifteen minute interval, (4) supplemental electricity received from the electric distribution company, measured in kilowatt-hours and average kilovolt-ampere per fifteen minute interval, (5) each downtime of the qualifying project, including the time of day of the downtime, the duration of the downtime and the reasons therefor, and (6) other such data as the authority deems appropriate. Such data shall be provided on a form approved by the authority.\n\n(f) The authority shall, with the system performance and supplemental utility data received pursuant to subsection (e) of this section, analyze (1) the system performance of the qualifying projects, (2) the as-used daily demand charge versus standard distributed generation rider demand charges, and (3) the viability of conforming all distributed generation combined heat and power systems to an as-used daily time of use demand tariff.\n\n(g) After the authority and commissioner have received the system performance and supplemental utility data pursuant to subsection (e) of this section for a period of three years, the commissioner shall, within ninety days, submit a report, in accordance with section 11-4a , to the joint standing committee of the General Assembly having cognizance of matters relating to energy, recommending whether to continue, expand, modify or eliminate the pilot program.\n\n(h) Any electric customer of an electric distribution company, as defined in section 16-1 , with a qualifying project that participates in the pilot program shall be allowed to aggregate all electric meters that are (1) on the same premises as such qualifying project, and (2) billable to such customer."
