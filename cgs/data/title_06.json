No member of the commission shall be a state marshal, except that two state marshals appointed by the State Marshals Advisory Board in accordance with section 6-38c shall serve as ex-officio, nonvoting members of the commission.\n\n(b) The chairperson shall serve for a three-year term and all appointments of members to replace those whose terms expire shall be for terms of three years.\n\n(c) If any vacancy occurs on the commission, the appointing authority having the power to make the initial appointment under the provisions of this section shall appoint a person for the unexpired term in accordance with the provisions of this section.\n\n(d) Members shall serve without compensation but shall be reimbursed for actual expenses incurred while engaged in the duties of the commission.\n\n(e) The commission, in consultation with the State Marshals Advisory Board, shall (1) adopt regulations in accordance with the provisions of chapter 54 to establish professional standards, including training requirements and minimum fees for execution and service of process, and (2) implement policies and procedures to increase state marshal participation in the serving of capias mittimus orders. Such policies and procedures may require that at all times a certain minimum percentage of the overall number of state marshals be actively engaged in the service of capias mittimus orders.\n\n(f) The commission shall be responsible for the equitable assignment of service of restraining orders to the state marshals in each county and ensure that such restraining orders are served expeditiously. Failure of any state marshal to accept for service any restraining order assigned by the commission or to serve such restraining order expeditiously without good cause shall be sufficient for the convening of a hearing for removal under subsection (i) of this section.\n\n(g) Any vacancy in the position of state marshal in any county as provided in section 6-38 shall be filled by the commission with an applicant who shall be an elector in the county where such vacancy occurs.
