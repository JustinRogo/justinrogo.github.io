If an employer takes immediate corrective action in response to an employee's claim of sexual harassment, such corrective action shall not modify the conditions of employment of the employee making the claim of sexual harassment unless such employee agrees, in writing, to any modification in the conditions of employment. “Corrective action” taken by an employer, includes, but is not limited to, employee relocation, assigning an employee to a different work schedule or other substantive changes to an employee's terms and conditions of employment.

Nothing in this subdivision is intended to prohibit an employer from taking reasonable measures to protect an employee from exposure to such substances. For the purpose of this subdivision, “reasonable measures” are those measures which are consistent with business necessity and are least disruptive of the terms and conditions of the employee's employment;\n\n(11) For an employer, by the employer or the employer's agent, for an employment agency, by itself or its agent, or for any labor organization, by itself or its agent: (A) To request or require genetic information from an employee, person seeking employment or member, or (B) to discharge, expel or otherwise discriminate against any person on the basis of genetic information.

No such plan which covers less than twenty employees may reduce the group hospital, surgical or medical insurance coverage provided under the plan to any employee who has reached the age of sixty-five and is eligible for Medicare benefits or any employee's spouse who has reached age sixty-five and is eligible for Medicare benefits except to the extent such coverage is provided by Medicare. The terms of any such plan which covers twenty or more employees shall entitle any employee who has attained the age of sixty-five and any employee's spouse who has attained the age of sixty-five to group hospital, surgical or medical insurance coverage under the same conditions as any covered employee or spouse who is under the age of sixty-five.\n\n(2) No employee retirement or pension plan may exclude any employee from membership in such plan or cease or reduce the employee's benefit accruals or allocations under such plan on the basis of age.

The Labor Commissioner may adopt regulations, in accordance with chapter 54, to establish additional requirements concerning the means by which employers shall provide such notice.\n\n(2) The Commission on Human Rights and Opportunities shall develop courses of instruction and conduct ongoing public education efforts as necessary to inform employers, employees, employment agencies and persons seeking employment about their rights and responsibilities under this section.\n\nSee Sec. 1-1f for definitions of “blind” and “physically disabled”.\n\nSee Sec. 28-17 re prohibition against discharging employee for civil preparedness activity or eligibility for induction into armed services."

The respondent shall either (1) file a written answer to the complaint as provided in subsection (b) of this section, or (2) not later than ten days after the date of receipt of the complaint, provide written notice to the complainant and the commission that the respondent has elected to participate in pre-answer conciliation, except that a discriminatory practice complaint alleging a violation of section 46a-64c or 46a-81e shall not be subject to pre-answer conciliation. A complaint sent by first class mail shall be considered to be received not later than two days after the date of mailing, unless the respondent proves otherwise. The commission shall conduct a pre-answer conciliation conference not later than thirty days after the date of receiving the respondent's request for pre-answer conciliation.",
              "(b) Except as provided in this subsection, not later than thirty days after the date (1) of receipt of the complaint, or (2) on which the commission determines that the pre-answer conciliation conference was unsuccessful, the respondent shall file a written answer to the complaint, under oath, with the commission. The respondent may request, and the commission may grant, one extension of time of not more than fifteen days within which to file a written answer to the complaint. An answer to any amendment to a complaint shall be filed within twenty days of the date of receipt to such amendment. The answer to any complaint alleging a violation of section 46a-64c or 46a-81e shall be filed not later than ten days after the date of receipt of the complaint.",
              "(c) Not later than sixty days after the date of the filing of the respondent's answer, the executive director or the executive director's designee shall conduct a case assessment review to determine whether the complaint should be retained for further processing or dismissed because (1) it fails to state a claim for relief or is frivolous on its face, (2) the respondent is exempt from the provisions of this chapter, or (3) there is no reasonable possibility that investigating the complaint will result in a finding of reasonable cause. The case assessment review shall include the complaint, the respondent's answer and the responses to the commission's requests for information, and the complainant's comments, if any, to the respondent's answer and information responses. The executive director or the executive director's designee shall send notice of any action taken pursuant to the case assessment review in accordance with section 46a-86a . For any complaint dismissed pursuant to this subsection, the executive director or the executive director's designee shall issue a release of jurisdiction allowing the complainant to bring a civil action under section 46a-100 .

A mediation conference may but need not be held if the commission has held a pre-answer conciliation conference. The investigator or commission legal counsel assigned to conduct the mediation shall not be assigned to investigate the complaint. The mandatory mediation conference may not be scheduled for the same time as a fact-finding conference held pursuant to subsection (f) of this section. The mediator may hold additional mediation conferences to accommodate settlement discussions.",
              "(e) If the complaint is not resolved after the mandatory mediation conference, the complainant, the respondent or the commission may at any time after such conference request early legal intervention. If a request for early legal intervention is made, a commission legal counsel shall determine not later than ninety days after the date of the request whether the complaint should be (1) heard pursuant to section 46a-84 , (2) processed pursuant to subsection (f) of this section, or (3) released from the jurisdiction of the commission. In making such determination, commission legal counsel may hold additional proceedings and may utilize and direct commission staff. If a commission legal counsel determines that the complaint should be processed pursuant to subsection (f) of this section, the commission legal counsel may recommend that the investigator make a finding of no reasonable cause. The investigator shall make such a finding unless the investigator believes the commission legal counsel made a mistake of fact. If the investigator intends to make a finding of reasonable cause after the commission legal counsel recommends otherwise, the investigator shall consult with the commission legal counsel.",
              "(f) Not later than fifteen days after the date of (1) a mandatory mediation conference that fails to resolve a complaint, or (2) an early legal intervention decision to investigate a complaint, the executive director or the executive director's designee shall assign an investigator to process the complaint. The investigator may process the complaint by any lawful means of finding facts, including, but not limited to, a fact-finding conference, individual witness interviews, requests for voluntary disclosure of information, subpoenas of witnesses or documents, requests for admission of facts, interrogatories, site visits or any combination of these means for the purpose of determining whether there is reasonable cause for believing that a discriminatory practice has been or is being committed as alleged in the complaint. As used in this section and section 46a-84 , “reasonable cause” means a bona fide belief that the material issues of fact are such that a person of ordinary caution, prudence and judgment could believe the facts alleged in the complaint.",
              "(g) (1) Before issuing a finding of reasonable cause or no reasonable cause, the investigator shall afford each party and each party's representative an opportunity to provide written or oral comments on all evidence in the commission's file, except as otherwise provided by federal law or the general statutes. The investigator shall consider such comments before making a finding. The investigator shall make a finding of reasonable cause or no reasonable cause in writing and shall list the factual findings on which it is based not later than one hundred ninety days from the date of the case assessment review, except that for good cause shown, the executive director or the executive director's designee may grant no more than two extensions of the investigation of three months each.",
              "(2) If the investigator makes a finding that there is reasonable cause to believe that a violation of section 46a-64c has occurred, the complainant and the respondent shall have twenty days from sending of the reasonable cause finding to elect a civil action in lieu of an administrative hearing pursuant to section 46a-84 . If either the complainant or the respondent requests a civil action, the commission, through the Attorney General or a commission legal counsel, shall commence an action pursuant to subsection (b) of section 46a-89 , not later than ninety days after the date of receipt of the notice of election. If the Attorney General or a commission legal counsel believes that injunctive relief, punitive damages or a civil penalty would be appropriate, such relief, damages or penalty may also be sought. The jurisdiction of the Superior Court in an action brought under this subdivision shall be limited to such claims, counterclaims, defenses or the like that could be presented at an administrative hearing before the commission, had the complaint remained with the commission for disposition. A complainant may intervene as a matter of right in a civil action without permission of the court or the parties. If the Attorney General or commission legal counsel, as the case may be, determines that the interests of the state will not be adversely affected, the complainant or attorney for the complainant shall present all or part of the case in support of the complaint. If the Attorney General or a commission legal counsel determines that a material mistake of law or fact has been made in the finding of reasonable cause, the Attorney General or a commission legal counsel may decline to bring a civil action and shall remand the file to the investigator for further action. The investigator shall complete any such action not later than ninety days after receipt of such file.",
              "(h) If the investigator issues a finding of no reasonable cause or if the complaint is dismissed pursuant to subsection (m) of this section, the complainant may file a written request for reconsideration with the executive director or the executive director's designee, not later than fifteen days from the sending of such finding or dismissal. A request for reconsideration shall state specifically the reasons why reconsideration should be granted. A commission legal counsel shall grant or reject reconsideration not later than ninety days after the date of the sending of such finding or dismissal. A commission legal counsel shall conduct such additional proceedings as may be necessary to render a decision on the request.",
              "(i) After finding that there is reasonable cause to believe that a discriminatory practice has been or is being committed as alleged in the complaint, an investigator shall attempt to eliminate the practice complained of by conference, conciliation and persuasion not later than fifty days after the date of the finding. The refusal to accept a settlement shall not be grounds for dismissal of any complaint.",
              "(j) No commissioner or employee of the commission may disclose, except to the parties or their representatives, what has occurred in the course of the commission's processing of a complaint, provided the commission may publish the facts in the case and any complaint that has been dismissed and the terms of conciliation when a complaint has been adjusted. Each party and his or her representative shall have the right to inspect and copy documents, statements of witnesses and other evidence pertaining to the complaint, except as otherwise provided by federal law or the general statutes.",
              "(k) In the investigation of any complaint filed pursuant to this chapter, commission legal counsel may issue subpoenas requiring the production of records and other documents or compelling the attendance of witnesses.",
              "(l) The executive director or the executive director's designee may enter an order of default against a respondent who (1) after notice, fails to answer a complaint in accordance with subsection (a) of this section or within such extension of time as may have been granted; (2) fails to answer interrogatories issued pursuant to subdivision (11) of section 46a-54 or fails to respond to a subpoena issued pursuant to subsection (k) of this section or subdivision (9) of section 46a-54 , provided the executive director or the executive director's designee shall consider any timely filed objection; (3) after notice and without good cause, fails to attend a fact-finding conference; or (4) after notice and without good cause, fails to attend a mandatory mediation conference. The respondent may make application to the executive director to vacate the default. Upon entry of an order of default or upon the decision of the executive director not to vacate the default, the executive director or the executive director's designee shall appoint a presiding officer to enter, after notice and hearing, an order eliminating the discriminatory practice complained of and making the complainant whole. The commission or the complainant may petition the Superior Court for enforcement of any order for relief pursuant to section 46a-95 .",
              "(m) The executive director or the executive director's designee may enter an order of dismissal against a complainant who (1) after notice and without good cause, fails to attend a fact-finding conference; (2) after notice and without good cause, fails to attend a mandatory mediation conference; or (3) refuses to accept an offer of settlement where the respondent has eliminated the discriminatory practice complained of, taken steps to prevent a like occurrence in the future and offered full relief to the complainant."

The respondent shall either (1) file a written answer to the complaint as provided in subsection (b) of this section, or (2) not later than ten days after the date of receipt of the complaint, provide written notice to the complainant and the commission that the respondent has elected to participate in pre-answer conciliation, except that a discriminatory practice complaint alleging a violation of section 46a-64c or 46a-81e shall not be subject to pre-answer conciliation. A complaint sent by first class mail shall be considered to be received not later than two days after the date of mailing, unless the respondent proves otherwise. The commission shall conduct a pre-answer conciliation conference not later than thirty days after the date of receiving the respondent's request for pre-answer conciliation.\n\n(b) Except as provided in this subsection, not later than thirty days after the date (1) of receipt of the complaint, or (2) on which the commission determines that the pre-answer conciliation conference was unsuccessful, the respondent shall file a written answer to the complaint, under oath, with the commission. The respondent may request, and the commission may grant, one extension of time of not more than fifteen days within which to file a written answer to the complaint. An answer to any amendment to a complaint shall be filed within twenty days of the date of receipt to such amendment. The answer to any complaint alleging a violation of section 46a-64c or 46a-81e shall be filed not later than ten days after the date of receipt of the complaint.\n\n(c) Not later than sixty days after the date of the filing of the respondent's answer, the executive director or the executive director's designee shall conduct a case assessment review to determine whether the complaint should be retained for further processing or dismissed because (1) it fails to state a claim for relief or is frivolous on its face, (2) the respondent is exempt from the provisions of this chapter, or (3) there is no reasonable possibility that investigating the complaint will result in a finding of reasonable cause. The case assessment review shall include the complaint, the respondent's answer and the responses to the commission's requests for information, and the complainant's comments, if any, to the respondent's answer and information responses. The executive director or the executive director's designee shall send notice of any action taken pursuant to the case assessment review in accordance with section 46a-86a . For any complaint dismissed pursuant to this subsection, the executive director or the executive director's designee shall issue a release of jurisdiction allowing the complainant to bring a civil action under section 46a-100 . This subsection and subsection (e) of this section shall not apply to any complaint alleging a violation of section 46a-64c or 46a-81e . The executive director shall report the results of the case assessment reviews made pursuant to this subsection to the commission quarterly during each year.\n\n(d) Not later than sixty days after the date of sending notice that a complaint has been retained after a case assessment review, the executive director or the executive director's designee shall assign an investigator or commission legal counsel to hold a mandatory mediation conference. A mediation conference may but need not be held if the commission has held a pre-answer conciliation conference. The investigator or commission legal counsel assigned to conduct the mediation shall not be assigned to investigate the complaint. The mandatory mediation conference may not be scheduled for the same time as a fact-finding conference held pursuant to subsection (f) of this section. The mediator may hold additional mediation conferences to accommodate settlement discussions.\n\n(e) If the complaint is not resolved after the mandatory mediation conference, the complainant, the respondent or the commission may at any time after such conference request early legal intervention. If a request for early legal intervention is made, a commission legal counsel shall determine not later than ninety days after the date of the request whether the complaint should be (1) heard pursuant to section 46a-84 , (2) processed pursuant to subsection (f) of this section, or (3) released from the jurisdiction of the commission. In making such determination, commission legal counsel may hold additional proceedings and may utilize and direct commission staff. If a commission legal counsel determines that the complaint should be processed pursuant to subsection (f) of this section, the commission legal counsel may recommend that the investigator make a finding of no reasonable cause. The investigator shall make such a finding unless the investigator believes the commission legal counsel made a mistake of fact. If the investigator intends to make a finding of reasonable cause after the commission legal counsel recommends otherwise, the investigator shall consult with the commission legal counsel.\n\n(f) Not later than fifteen days after the date of (1) a mandatory mediation conference that fails to resolve a complaint, or (2) an early legal intervention decision to investigate a complaint, the executive director or the executive director's designee shall assign an investigator to process the complaint. The investigator may process the complaint by any lawful means of finding facts, including, but not limited to, a fact-finding conference, individual witness interviews, requests for voluntary disclosure of information, subpoenas of witnesses or documents, requests for admission of facts, interrogatories, site visits or any combination of these means for the purpose of determining whether there is reasonable cause for believing that a discriminatory practice has been or is being committed as alleged in the complaint. As used in this section and section 46a-84 , “reasonable cause” means a bona fide belief that the material issues of fact are such that a person of ordinary caution, prudence and judgment could believe the facts alleged in the complaint.\n\n(g) (1) Before issuing a finding of reasonable cause or no reasonable cause, the investigator shall afford each party and each party's representative an opportunity to provide written or oral comments on all evidence in the commission's file, except as otherwise provided by federal law or the general statutes. The investigator shall consider such comments before making a finding. The investigator shall make a finding of reasonable cause or no reasonable cause in writing and shall list the factual findings on which it is based not later than one hundred ninety days from the date of the case assessment review, except that for good cause shown, the executive director or the executive director's designee may grant no more than two extensions of the investigation of three months each.\n\n(2) If the investigator makes a finding that there is reasonable cause to believe that a violation of section 46a-64c has occurred, the complainant and the respondent shall have twenty days from sending of the reasonable cause finding to elect a civil action in lieu of an administrative hearing pursuant to section 46a-84 . If either the complainant or the respondent requests a civil action, the commission, through the Attorney General or a commission legal counsel, shall commence an action pursuant to subsection (b) of section 46a-89 , not later than ninety days after the date of receipt of the notice of election. If the Attorney General or a commission legal counsel believes that injunctive relief, punitive damages or a civil penalty would be appropriate, such relief, damages or penalty may also be sought. The jurisdiction of the Superior Court in an action brought under this subdivision shall be limited to such claims, counterclaims, defenses or the like that could be presented at an administrative hearing before the commission, had the complaint remained with the commission for disposition. A complainant may intervene as a matter of right in a civil action without permission of the court or the parties. If the Attorney General or commission legal counsel, as the case may be, determines that the interests of the state will not be adversely affected, the complainant or attorney for the complainant shall present all or part of the case in support of the complaint. If the Attorney General or a commission legal counsel determines that a material mistake of law or fact has been made in the finding of reasonable cause, the Attorney General or a commission legal counsel may decline to bring a civil action and shall remand the file to the investigator for further action. The investigator shall complete any such action not later than ninety days after receipt of such file.\n\n(h) If the investigator issues a finding of no reasonable cause or if the complaint is dismissed pursuant to subsection (m) of this section, the complainant may file a written request for reconsideration with the executive director or the executive director's designee, not later than fifteen days from the sending of such finding or dismissal. A request for reconsideration shall state specifically the reasons why reconsideration should be granted. A commission legal counsel shall grant or reject reconsideration not later than ninety days after the date of the sending of such finding or dismissal. A commission legal counsel shall conduct such additional proceedings as may be necessary to render a decision on the request.\n\n(i) After finding that there is reasonable cause to believe that a discriminatory practice has been or is being committed as alleged in the complaint, an investigator shall attempt to eliminate the practice complained of by conference, conciliation and persuasion not later than fifty days after the date of the finding. The refusal to accept a settlement shall not be grounds for dismissal of any complaint.\n\n(j) No commissioner or employee of the commission may disclose, except to the parties or their representatives, what has occurred in the course of the commission's processing of a complaint, provided the commission may publish the facts in the case and any complaint that has been dismissed and the terms of conciliation when a complaint has been adjusted. Each party and his or her representative shall have the right to inspect and copy documents, statements of witnesses and other evidence pertaining to the complaint, except as otherwise provided by federal law or the general statutes.\n\n(k) In the investigation of any complaint filed pursuant to this chapter, commission legal counsel may issue subpoenas requiring the production of records and other documents or compelling the attendance of witnesses.\n\n(l) The executive director or the executive director's designee may enter an order of default against a respondent who (1) after notice, fails to answer a complaint in accordance with subsection (a) of this section or within such extension of time as may have been granted; (2) fails to answer interrogatories issued pursuant to subdivision (11) of section 46a-54 or fails to respond to a subpoena issued pursuant to subsection (k) of this section or subdivision (9) of section 46a-54 , provided the executive director or the executive director's designee shall consider any timely filed objection; (3) after notice and without good cause, fails to attend a fact-finding conference; or (4) after notice and without good cause, fails to attend a mandatory mediation conference. The respondent may make application to the executive director to vacate the default. Upon entry of an order of default or upon the decision of the executive director not to vacate the default, the executive director or the executive director's designee shall appoint a presiding officer to enter, after notice and hearing, an order eliminating the discriminatory practice complained of and making the complainant whole. The commission or the complainant may petition the Superior Court for enforcement of any order for relief pursuant to section 46a-95 .\n\n(m) The executive director or the executive director's designee may enter an order of dismissal against a complainant who (1) after notice and without good cause, fails to attend a fact-finding conference; (2) after notice and without good cause, fails to attend a mandatory mediation conference; or (3) refuses to accept an offer of settlement where the respondent has eliminated the discriminatory practice complained of, taken steps to prevent a like occurrence in the future and offered full relief to the complainant."

The investigator's conclusion that conciliation has failed shall be conclusive on the issue.\n\n(b) Upon (1) certification of a complaint filed pursuant to subsection (a) or (b) of section 46a-82 , (2) the filing of a complaint pursuant to subsection (c) of said section, or (3) a decision to hear a complaint, which is made pursuant to subsection (e) of section 46a-83 , the Chief Human Rights Referee shall appoint a human rights referee to act as a presiding officer to hear the complaint. The chief referee shall also appoint an individual authorized by subsection (e) of this section or a referee, other than the referee appointed to hear the complaint, to conduct settlement negotiations. The chief referee shall serve in the name of the commission, and in accordance with section 46a-86a , a copy of the complaint, as the same may have been amended, requiring the respondent to answer the charges of the complaint, together with a written notice requiring the respondent to appear at a hearing or settlement conference at a date and time specified in the notice.

The investigator shall complete any required action not later than ninety days after receipt of such file. The complainant may be represented by an attorney of the complainant's own choice.

The commission or the complainant may petition the Superior Court for enforcement of any such order for relief pursuant to section 46a-95 .\n\n(g) The presiding officer conducting any hearing shall permit reasonable amendment to any complaint or answer and the testimony taken at the hearing shall be under oath and be transcribed at the request of any party.\n\n(h) The complainant, the respondent and the commission shall be afforded the opportunity to inspect and copy relevant and material records, papers and documents not in the possession of such party, except as otherwise provided by applicable state law. The presiding officer may order a party to produce such records, papers and documents, and if a party fails to comply with such order within thirty days of the date of such order, the presiding officer may issue a nonmonetary order that the presiding officer deems just and appropriate, including, but not limited to, an order (1) finding that the matters that are the subject of the order are established in accordance with the claim of the party requesting such order, (2) prohibiting the party who has failed to comply with such order from introducing designated matters into evidence, (3) limiting the participation of the noncomplying party with regard to issues or facts relating to the order, and (4) drawing an adverse inference against the noncomplying party.\n\n(i) When the executive director of the commission has determined that there are available appropriations and otherwise approves a request, the Chief Human Rights Referee may appoint any magistrate, who is on the list of available magistrates maintained by the Chief Court Administrator, to act as a presiding officer at any proceeding conducted pursuant to this section, subsection (l) of section 46a-83 , subsection (c) or (d) of section 46a-56 or subsection (e) of section 4-61dd .
