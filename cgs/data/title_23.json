In addition, the court may award damages of up to five times the cost of restoration or statutory damages of up to five thousand dollars. In determining the amount of the award, the court shall consider the willfulness of the violation, the extent of damage done to natural resources, if any, the appraised value of the shrub or ornamental or shade tree, any economic gain realized by the violator and any other relevant factors. The appraised value shall be determined by the town tree warden, the borough tree warden, the city forester, the Commissioner of Transportation, the Public Utilities Regulatory Authority or other authority having jurisdiction and shall be determined in accordance with regulations adopted by the Commissioner of Energy and Environmental Protection. The commissioner shall adopt regulations, in accordance with the provisions of chapter 54, to develop guidelines for such plant appraisal. The regulations may incorporate by reference the latest revision of The Guide for Plant Appraisal, as published by the International Society of Arboriculture, Urbana, Illinois. Until such time as regulations are adopted, appraisals may be made in accordance with said Guide for Plant Appraisal.\n\n(c) Any person, firm or corporation which deposits or throws any advertisement within the limits of any municipal property or public way or grounds, or upon private premises or property, unless the same is left at the door of the residence or place of business of the occupant of such premises or property, or deposits or throws any refuse paper, camp or picnic refuse, junk or other material within the limits of any parcel of municipal property or public way or grounds, except at a place designated for that purpose by the authority having supervision and control of such municipal property or public way or grounds, or upon private premises or property without permission of the owner thereof, or affixes to or maintains upon any tree, rock or other natural object within the limits of a parcel of municipal property or public way or grounds any paper or advertisement other than notices posted in accordance with the provisions of the statutes, or affixes to or maintains, upon the property of another without his consent, any word, letter, character or device intended to advertise the sale of any article, shall (1) for a first offense, be fined not more than two hundred fifty dollars, and (2) for any subsequent offense, be guilty of a class C misdemeanor.\n\n(d) The removal, pruning or wilful injury of any shrub or ornamental or shade tree, or the use of climbing spurs upon any ornamental or shade tree without the consent of the tree warden or of the officer with similar duties or the affixing of any playbill, picture, notice, advertisement or other similar thing concerning the business or affairs of any person, firm or corporation, to a pole, shrub, tree, rock or other natural object, within the limits of any parcel of municipal property, public way or grounds in violation of the provisions of this section by an agent or employee of such person, firm or corporation, shall be deemed to be the act of such person, firm or corporation, and such person, or any member of such firm or any officer of such corporation, as the case may be, shall be subject to the penalty herein provided, unless such act is shown to have been done without his knowledge or consent.\n\n(e) The affixing of each individual playbill, picture, notice, advertisement or other similar thing to a pole, shrub, tree, rock or other natural object, or the wilful removing, pruning, injuring or defacing of each shrub or tree, or the throwing of each individual advertisement or lot of refuse paper or other material within the limits of any parcel of municipal property or public way or grounds or on private premises, shall constitute a separate violation of the provisions of this section. Nothing in this section shall affect the authority of a tree warden, either by himself or by a person receiving a written permit from him, to remove, prune or otherwise deal with a shrub or tree under his jurisdiction.\n\n(f) Any person, firm or corporation, other than a tree warden or his deputy, who desires the cutting or removal, in whole or in part, of any tree or shrub or part thereof within the limits of any parcel of municipal property or public road or grounds, may apply in writing to the town tree warden, the borough tree warden or the Commissioner of Transportation or other authority having jurisdiction thereof for a permit so to do. Upon receipt of such permit, but not before, the applicant may proceed with such cutting or removal, provided doing so is also consistent with section 16-234 , if applicable. Before granting or denying such permit, such authority may hold a public hearing as provided in section 23-59 . Such application shall be acknowledged by the authorizing authority upon the commencement of any public comment period or public hearing or upon such authority's decision to forego such a hearing. When the applicant is a public utility corporation, the party aggrieved by such decision may, within ten days, appeal therefrom to the Public Utilities Regulatory Authority, which shall have the power to review, confirm, change or set aside the decision appealed from and its decision shall be final provided a tree warden's reasonable delay to act on such an application for the purpose of public comment or review of the affected vegetation shall not be considered a denial or constitute grounds for an appeal to the Public Utilities Regulatory Authority. The burden of proving that public convenience and necessity requires the proposed cutting or removal shall be on the utility. This appeals process shall be in addition to the powers granted to the Public Utilities Regulatory Authority under section 16-234 , provided, if an application for such permit has been made to either a tree warden or the Commissioner of Transportation or other authority and denied by him, an application for a permit for the same relief shall not be made to any other such authority. Upon any approval of such a permit by the Commissioner of Transportation, he shall notify the tree warden for the town in which the tree is located. Upon any approval of such a permit by the Commissioner of Transportation, the permittee shall notify the tree warden for the town in which the tree is located prior to cutting any such tree.\n\nSee Sec. 52-560a re encroachment on open space land."

              "(2) The commissioner shall require the applicant for supervising forest products harvester certification to demonstrate, upon examination, that the applicant possesses adequate knowledge concerning techniques and procedures normally employed in the conduct and supervision of a harvest operation, the safe and environmentally responsible operation of harvesting equipment, and mitigating measures to be employed to minimize possible adverse impacts of harvesting activity on environmental conditions within the harvest area.",

The certification shall be valid for a period not to exceed five years and may be renewed by the commissioner with or without further examination. The commissioner may establish regulations for forest practitioner certification so that one-fifth of the certificates expire each year. The commissioner may certify a forest practitioner for less than five years and prorate the registration fee accordingly to implement the regulations established pursuant to this subsection. The commissioner may grant a sixty-day extension for any forest practitioner who failed to submit a complete application for renewal prior to the expiration date of such forest practitioner's certification. Such forest practitioner shall submit a complete application for renewal not later than the end date of such sixty-day extension period. Any such renewed certification issued by the commissioner following such a sixty-day extension period shall not require reexamination by such forest practitioner prior to such issuance but shall require the submission of an additional fee, as determined by the commissioner.",

The commissioner shall inform the applicant of the refusal in writing, giving the reasons for such refusal. Any person aggrieved by such refusal may, within thirty days from date of issuance of such denial, request a hearing before the commissioner, which hearing shall be conducted in accordance with chapter 54.",
              "(6) The commissioner may certify without examination any person who is certified in another state under a law which provides substantially similar qualifications for certification or through examination by the Society of American Foresters, or a similar organization, that provides substantially similar qualifications for certification provided such person can demonstrate knowledge of the forestry laws of this state to the commissioner's satisfaction.",

Forester certification shall be required for commercial forest practitioners who supervise or engage in the planning and design of forest practices, including but not limited to, commercial forest product harvest operations, or act as a property owner's agent in the sale of commercial forest products. A certified forester may also execute contracts or agreements, written or verbal, for the purchase of commercial forest products, act in the buyers behalf in the supervision of commercial forest product harvest operations and engage in the execution of commercial forest product harvest operations. Supervising forest products harvester certification shall be required for commercial forest practitioners who execute contracts or agreements, written or verbal, for the purchase of commercial forest products or who act in the buyer's behalf in the supervision of commercial forest product harvest operations. A certified supervising forest products harvester may also engage in the execution of commercial forest product harvest operations. Forest products harvester certification shall be required for commercial forest practitioners who engage in the execution of commercial forest product harvest operations, provided no such certification shall be required for persons engaging in the execution of commercial forest practices under the direct, on-site supervision of a certified forest product harvester. No forest product harvester certified under this section shall engage in the on-site supervision of more than two noncertified persons executing commercial forest practices.\n\n(c) An application for the certification as a forest practitioner shall be made to the Commissioner of Energy and Environmental Protection and shall contain such information regarding the applicant's qualifications and proposed operations and other relevant matters as the commissioner deems necessary.\n\n(1) The commissioner shall require the applicant for forester certification to demonstrate, upon examination, that the applicant possesses adequate knowledge concerning the proper application of forest management techniques, the ecological and environmental consequences of harvesting activity and mitigating measures to be employed to minimize possible adverse impacts on environmental conditions within the harvest area.\n\n(2) The commissioner shall require the applicant for supervising forest products harvester certification to demonstrate, upon examination, that the applicant possesses adequate knowledge concerning techniques and procedures normally employed in the conduct and supervision of a harvest operation, the safe and environmentally responsible operation of harvesting equipment, and mitigating measures to be employed to minimize possible adverse impacts of harvesting activity on environmental conditions within the harvest area.\n\n(3) The commissioner shall require the applicant for forest products harvester certification to demonstrate, upon examination, that the applicant possesses adequate knowledge concerning techniques and procedures normally employed in the conduct of a harvest operation and the safe and environmentally responsible operation of harvesting equipment, except that an applicant who demonstrates to the satisfaction of the commissioner that the applicant has engaged in commercial forest practices at least once per year for the ten years immediately preceding October 1, 1991, shall be exempt from such examination requirement.\n\n(4) If the commissioner finds that the applicant is competent with respect to the required qualifications, including those provided in section 23-65o , the commissioner shall certify the applicant to perform such forest practices as appropriate to the requested certification. The certification shall be valid for a period not to exceed five years and may be renewed by the commissioner with or without further examination. The commissioner may establish regulations for forest practitioner certification so that one-fifth of the certificates expire each year. The commissioner may certify a forest practitioner for less than five years and prorate the registration fee accordingly to implement the regulations established pursuant to this subsection. The commissioner may grant a sixty-day extension for any forest practitioner who failed to submit a complete application for renewal prior to the expiration date of such forest practitioner's certification. Such forest practitioner shall submit a complete application for renewal not later than the end date of such sixty-day extension period. Any such renewed certification issued by the commissioner following such a sixty-day extension period shall not require reexamination by such forest practitioner prior to such issuance but shall require the submission of an additional fee, as determined by the commissioner.\n\n(5) If the commissioner finds that the applicant is not competent with respect to the requirements for the requested certification, the commissioner shall refuse to issue the applicant a certificate. The commissioner shall inform the applicant of the refusal in writing, giving the reasons for such refusal. Any person aggrieved by such refusal may, within thirty days from date of issuance of such denial, request a hearing before the commissioner, which hearing shall be conducted in accordance with chapter 54.\n\n(6) The commissioner may certify without examination any person who is certified in another state under a law which provides substantially similar qualifications for certification or through examination by the Society of American Foresters, or a similar organization, that provides substantially similar qualifications for certification provided such person can demonstrate knowledge of the forestry laws of this state to the commissioner's satisfaction.\n\n(7) The commissioner may, by regulation, adopted in accordance with the provisions of chapter 54, prescribe fees for applicants to defray the cost of administering examinations and carrying out the provisions of this chapter. A state or municipal employee who engages in activities for which certification is required by this section solely as part of his employment shall be exempt from payment of a fee. Any certificate issued to a state or municipal employee for which a fee has not been paid shall be void upon termination of such government employment.\n\n(8) The commissioner may require the display of a decal or other evidence, indicating that a commercial forest practitioner has met the requirements of sections 23-65f to 23-65o , inclusive, in a prominent place on any licensed motor vehicle used in the practitioner's operations. A fee may be charged to the certified practitioner to cover the cost of the decal or other evidence.\n\n(9) The commissioner shall require all forest practitioners certified under sections 23-65f to 23-65o , inclusive, to participate in a relevant program of professional education to improve or maintain professional forestry skills that is sponsored by the Department of Energy and Environmental Protection, the New England Society of American Foresters, The University of Connecticut, Yale University or the Connecticut cooperative extension system, or participation in another program approved by the department.

For purposes of this section, the inland wetlands agency shall serve as the sole municipal agent for regulation of forest practices. Any municipality named in this subsection shall have one year from the effective date of regulations adopted by the commissioner for the regulation of forest practices to comply with the terms of this section. No municipality which regulates forest practices pursuant to the authority of this section shall reject any application without having such rejection reviewed by a forester certified by the Department of Energy and Environmental Protection retained by the agency for that purpose. Upon written request of the applicant, a forester certified by the department shall review and make recommendations to the inland wetlands agency on any application to conduct forest practices. The costs associated with any review provided for in this section shall be borne by the applicant provided in no event shall the total of fees and costs paid by the applicant in connection with an application to conduct forest practices exceed the standard fee which would be charged by the department for a similar application.\n\n(b) Any municipality not named in subsection (a) of this section which has, as of January 1, 1998, a program of regulation for forest practices may apply to the commissioner for approval to administer a municipal program of regulation in accordance with the provisions of this section. The commissioner may approve such program if he finds that such program was in existence on January 1, 1998, and was at that time in compliance with the standards provided by the Connecticut Resource Conservation and Development Forestry Committee.\n\n(c) At least one member or staff member of the inland wetlands agency shall complete a training program on forest practices which shall be developed by the commissioner. The commissioner shall annually make such program available to one person from each town without cost to that person or the town. Each inland wetlands agency authorized to regulate forest practices shall present a summary of the training program to the members of the agency at least once annually. Failure to have the training required under this subsection shall not affect the validity of any action of the agency.\n\n(d) Any municipal ordinance or regulation concerning forest practices, adopted in accordance with subsection (a) of this section, shall not be effective unless such ordinance or regulation has been submitted to the commissioner for approval, and the commissioner has approved said ordinance or regulation as consistent with the purposes of sections 23-65f to 23-65o , inclusive, and regulations adopted thereunder and further finds that the municipality submitting such regulations had in effect on January 1, 1998, a program of regulation for forest practices which was in compliance with the standards provided by the Connecticut Resource Conservation and Development Forestry Committee. No municipal ordinance or regulation governing commercial forest practices which is in effect on the effective date of regulations adopted pursuant to section 23-65j shall be valid after the expiration of one year following the effective date of such department regulations unless such ordinance or regulation has been submitted to the commissioner for approval, and the commissioner has approved such ordinance or regulation as consistent with the purposes of sections 23-65f to 23-65o , inclusive, and regulations adopted thereunder. The commissioner shall provide written notification to the municipality of the approval of a municipal ordinance or regulation or the reasons such ordinance or regulation is not approved. Such written notification shall be issued within sixty days of receipt by the commissioner of the ordinance or regulation adopted by the municipality. The commissioner may require modifications to such municipal ordinances or regulations within one hundred eighty days of any modifications to regulations adopted by the commissioner under section 23-65j .\n\n(e) Any form used by a municipality for the registration and approval of a forest practice shall be consistent with forms approved by the commissioner.\n\n(f) An inland wetlands agency authorized under subsection (a) or (b) of this section may require a reasonable filing fee to be deposited with the agency for any application to conduct forest practices. The amount of such fee shall be sufficient to cover the reasonable cost of reviewing and acting on applications, including, but not limited to, the cost of certified mailings, publications of notices and decisions and monitoring compliance with registration conditions or agency orders provided such fee is no greater than the comparable fee charged by the commissioner.\n\n(g) Each inland wetlands agency authorized to regulate forest practices shall annually report to the commissioner information on registrations, orders and other actions of such agency on a form furnished by the commissioner. Such information shall include, but not be limited to, the following: (1) Registrations issued; (2) registrations denied; and (3) enforcement notices and orders.\n\n(h) The commissioner shall regulate forest practices in accordance with the provisions of section 23-65j within a municipality which does not regulate forest practices in accordance with this section.\n\n(i) On or after the effective date of the municipal regulations adopted under subsection (a) of this section, no forest practice shall be conducted upon any forest land within the municipality except in accordance with such regulations.\n\n(j) If a forest practice is being conducted on a parcel of real property which extends into two or more contiguous towns, the commissioner shall have sole jurisdiction over such practice unless each such town has a program of regulation approved under this section. If the commissioner determines that there is any conflict between such programs, the state regulations shall govern such practice."
