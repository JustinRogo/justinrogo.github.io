The Correction Ombuds shall exhaust all other means to reach a resolution before initiating litigation; and\n\n(H) Publishing on an Internet web site operated by the Office of the Correction Ombuds a semiannual summary of all ombuds services and activities during the six-month period before such publication.\n\n(b) Notwithstanding any provision of the general statutes, the Correction Ombuds shall act independently of any department in the performance of the office's duties.\n\n(c) The Correction Ombuds may, within available funds, appoint such staff as may be deemed necessary. The duties of the staff may include the duties and powers of the Correction Ombuds if performed under the direction of the Correction Ombuds.\n\n(d) The General Assembly shall annually appropriate such sums as necessary for the payment of the salaries of the staff and for the payment of office expenses and other actual expenses incurred by the Correction Ombuds in the performance of the Correction Ombuds' duties. Any legal or court fees obtained by the state in actions brought by the Correction Ombuds shall be deposited in the General Fund.\n\n(e) In the course of investigations, the Correction Ombuds shall rely on a variety of sources to corroborate matters raised by incarcerated persons or others. Where such matters turn on validation of particular incidents, the Correction Ombuds shall endeavor to rely on communications from incarcerated persons who have reasonably pursued a resolution of the complaint through any existing internal grievance procedures of the Department of Correction. In all events, the Correction Ombuds shall make good faith efforts to provide an opportunity to the Commissioner of Correction to investigate and to respond to such concerns prior to making such matters public.\n\n(f) All oral and written communications, and records relating to such communications between a person in the custody of the Commissioner of Correction and the Correction Ombuds or a member of the Office of the Correction Ombuds staff, including, but not limited to, the identity of a complainant, the details of the communications and the Correction Ombuds' findings shall be confidential and shall not be disclosed without the consent of such person, except that the Correction Ombuds may disclose without the consent of such person general findings or policy recommendations based on such communications, provided no individually identifiable information is disclosed.

There is established within the General Fund a Correction Ombuds account which shall be a separate, nonlapsing account. Any funds received under this subsection shall, upon deposit in the General Fund, be credited to said account and may be used by the Correction Ombuds in the performance of the Correction Ombuds' duties.\n\n(k) The name, address and other personally identifiable information of a person who makes a complaint to the Correction Ombuds, information obtained or generated by the Office of the Correction Ombuds in the course of an investigation and all confidential records obtained by the Correction Ombuds or the office shall be confidential and shall not be subject to disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act, as defined in section 1-200 , or otherwise except as provided in subsections (f) and (g) of this section.\n\n(l) No state or municipal agency shall discharge, or in any manner discriminate or retaliate against, any employee who in good faith makes a complaint to the Correction Ombuds or cooperates with the Office of the Correction Ombuds in an investigation.\n\n(m) Not later than December 1, 2023, and annually thereafter, the Correction Ombuds shall submit a report, in accordance with section 11-4a , to the joint standing committee of the General Assembly having cognizance of matters relating to the Department of Correction regarding the conditions of confinement in the state's correctional facilities and halfway houses.

The proceeds from all sales resulting from such activities shall be paid to the Treasurer and credited to said fund.\n\n(b) The commissioner shall approve the establishment and maintenance of any and all such industrial activities, which may include, but need not be limited to, an optical shop to produce prescription eyeglasses for inmates of correctional institutions, for persons under state care in other institutions and for other persons receiving or eligible to receive benefits under Title XIX of the federal Social Security Act, as amended, provided such optical shop is under the direct supervision of an optician licensed under chapter 381, and provided further such eyeglasses are prescribed by an optometrist licensed under chapter 380, and are fitted by such licensed optometrist or by an optician licensed under chapter 381, after considering and determining the extent, if any, to which each industry may compete with private industry and, as far as possible, shall encourage a diversified program. If the optical shop is unable to fill the prescription for such eyeglasses for any reason, within the two-week period from its receipt of such prescription, the shop shall notify the person who prescribed such eyeglasses within ten days after receipt of such prescription.\n\n(c) The commissioner may, by regulation, provide, for any injury suffered by any inmate arising out of and in the course of his employment in such industries, a compensation award not covered under section 4-165b . Such payments shall not exceed the sum of one dollar and fifty cents per week and shall be payable solely from profits from such industries.\n\n(d) The commissioner may appoint, in accordance with chapter 67, a superintendent of institution industries and such assistants and employees as he deems necessary to (1) manage the industries, (2) market and deliver the products and (3) investigate complaints.

The commissioner may promulgate and circulate at sufficiently frequent intervals for distribution to the Commissioner of Administrative Services, the Comptroller and such political subdivisions a catalog showing styles, designs, sizes and varieties of all articles, materials and products manufactured and produced at the institutions and periodical price lists for all such articles.\n\n(g) Each state department, agency, commission or board shall purchase its necessary products and services from the institution industries if such products and services are produced or manufactured and made available by such industries, provided such products and services are of comparable price and quality and in sufficient quantity as may be available for sale or offered for sale outside the institutions.\n\n(h) The commissioner shall file an annual report of the industrial operations with the Governor and a balance sheet and statement of operations with the Comptroller at such times as he requests. The commissioner shall determine at the end of each fiscal year the amount of cash working capital necessary to be retained in the industrial fund and the excess of the amount so determined shall be transferred to the General Fund.\n\n(i) The Commissioner of Correction may establish retail hobby stores for the purpose of the sale to the public, but not for resale, of articles made by inmates of any of the institutions of the department. The proceeds of such sales, less a charge to defray the cost of the sales as determined by the commissioner, shall be deposited in the inmate's institutional account.
