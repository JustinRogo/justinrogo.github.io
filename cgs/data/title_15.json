              "(a) The Connecticut Port Authority may authorize the issuance of bonds in one or more series and in principal amounts necessary to carry out the purposes of sections 15-31a to 15-31i , inclusive. Such bonds shall be payable from all or a portion of the revenues of the ports and harbors of the state as may be specified in the proceedings authorizing such bonds, and may include, among other types of bonds, special purpose revenue bonds payable solely from revenues derived from special purpose facilities and bonds payable from particular sources of revenues. The authority may request such assistance from the Treasurer as may be necessary or desirable for the issuance by the authority of bonds to finance such projects and other improvements. The expense of such assistance shall be payable from the proceeds of such bonds and the State Treasurer may provide such assistance. The authority may appoint a finance or other committee of the board or one or more officers or employees to serve as the board's authorized delegate in connection with the issuance of bonds pursuant to this section.",
              "(b) Bonds issued pursuant to this section shall be obligations of the authority and shall neither be payable from nor charged upon any funds other than the revenues of the authority pledged to the payment thereof, nor shall the state or any political subdivision thereof be subject to any liability thereon except to the extent of such pledged revenues. The issuance of bonds under the provisions of this section and sections 15-31d to 15-31f , inclusive, shall not directly or indirectly or contingently obligate the state or any political subdivision thereof to levy or to pledge any form of taxation whatever therefor or to make any appropriation for their payment. The bonds shall not constitute a charge, lien or encumbrance, legal or equitable, upon any property of the state or of any political subdivision thereof, except the property of the authority or the state mortgaged or otherwise encumbered under the provisions and for the purposes of sections 15-31a to 15-31i , inclusive. The substance of such limitation shall be plainly stated on the face of each bond. Bonds issued pursuant to this section and sections 15-31d to 15-31f , inclusive, shall not be subject to any statutory limitation on the indebtedness of the state and such bonds, when issued, shall not be included in computing the aggregate indebtedness of the state in respect to and to the extent of any such limitation.",
              "(c) The bonds referred to in this section may be executed and delivered at such time or times, shall be dated, shall bear interest at such rate or rates, including variable rates to be determined in such manner as set forth in the proceedings authorizing the issuance of the bonds, provide for payment of interest on such dates, whether before or at maturity, shall mature at such time or times not exceeding thirty years from their date, have such rank or priority, be payable in such medium of payment, be issued in coupon, registered or book entry form, carry such registration and transfer privileges and be subject to purchase or redemption before maturity at such price or prices and under such terms and conditions, including the condition that such bonds be subject to purchase or redemption on the demand of the owner thereof, all as may be determined by the authority. The authority shall determine the form of the bonds, including any interest coupons to be attached thereto, the manner of execution of the bonds, the denomination or denominations of the bonds and the place or places of payment of principal and interest, which may be at any bank or trust company within or without the state. Prior to the preparation of definitive bonds, the authority may, under like restrictions, provide for the issuance of interim receipts or temporary bonds, with or without coupons, exchangeable for definitive bonds when such bonds have been executed and are available for delivery. If any of the officers whose signatures appear on the bonds or coupons cease to be officers before the delivery of any such bonds, such signatures shall, nevertheless, be valid and sufficient for all purposes, the same as if they had remained in office until delivery.",
              "(d) Any bonds issued under the authority of this section and sections 15-31d to 15-31f , inclusive, may be sold at public sale on sealed proposals or by negotiation in such manner, at such price and at such time or times as may be determined by the authority. The authority may pay from the proceeds of the bonds all costs and expenses which the authority may deem necessary or advantageous in connection with the authorization, sale and issuance thereof, including the cost of interest on any short-term financing authorized under subsection (b) of section 15-31d .",
              "(e) The principal of and interest on any bonds issued pursuant to this section shall be secured by a pledge of the revenues out of which such bonds shall be made payable. They may be secured by a mortgage covering all or any part of the project from which the revenues so pledged may be derived or by a pledge of one or more leases, sale contracts or loan agreements with respect to such project or by a pledge of one or more notes, debentures, bonds or other secured or unsecured debt obligations of any lessee or contracting party under a loan agreement or sale contract or by a pledge of reserve and sinking funds established pursuant to the resolution authorizing the issuance of the bonds and any other funds and accounts, including proceeds from investment of any of the foregoing, established pursuant to this chapter or the proceedings authorizing the issuance of such bonds, and by moneys paid under a credit facility, including, but not limited to, a letter of credit or policy of bond insurance, issued by a financial institution pursuant to an agreement authorized by such proceedings.",
              "(f) The proceedings under which the bonds are authorized to be issued pursuant to this section, and any mortgage given to secure the same, may, subject to the provisions of the general statutes, contain any agreements and provisions customarily contained in instruments securing bonds, including, but not limited to: (1) Provisions respecting custody of the proceeds from the sale of the bonds, including their investment and reinvestment until used for the cost of the project; (2) provisions respecting the fixing and collection of rents or payments with respect to the facilities of the ports and harbors of the state and any facility charges; (3) the terms to be incorporated in the lease, sale contract or loan agreement with respect to the project; (4) the maintenance and insurance of the project; (5) the creation, maintenance, custody, investment and reinvestment, and use of the revenues derived from the operation of the ports and harbors of the state; (6) establishment of reserves or sinking funds, and such accounts thereunder as may be established by the authority, and the regulation and disposition thereof; (7) the rights and remedies available in case of a default to the bondholders or to any trustee under any lease, sale contract, loan agreement, mortgage or trust indenture; (8) reimbursement agreements, remarketing agreements, standby bond purchase agreements or similar agreements in connection with obtaining any credit or liquidity facilities including, but not limited to, letters of credit or policies of bond insurance and such other agreements entered into pursuant to section 3-20a ; (9) provisions for the issuance of additional bonds on a parity with bonds theretofore issued, including establishment of coverage requirements with respect thereto; (10) covenants to do or to refrain from doing such acts and things as may be necessary or convenient or desirable in order to better secure any bonds or to maintain any federal or state exemption from tax of the interest on such bonds; and (11) provisions or covenants of like or different character from the foregoing which are consistent with the provisions of sections 15-31a to 15-31i , inclusive, and which the authority determines in such proceedings are necessary, convenient or desirable in order to better secure the bonds or bond anticipation notes, or will tend to make the bonds or bond anticipation notes more marketable, and which are in the best interests of the state. The proceedings under which the bonds are authorized, and any mortgage given to secure the same, may further provide that any cash balances not necessary (A) to pay the cost of maintaining, repairing and operating the facilities of the ports and harbors of the state, (B) to pay the principal of and interest on the bonds as the same shall become due and payable, and (C) to create and maintain reserve and sinking funds as provided in any authorizing resolution or other proceedings shall be deposited into one or more specifically designated working funds to be held in trust by the authority and applied to future debt service requirements or other port authority purposes.",
              "(g) In the discretion of the authority, bonds issued pursuant to this section may be secured by a trust indenture by and between the authority and a corporate trustee, which may be any trust company or bank having the powers of a trust company within or without the state. Such trust indenture may contain such provisions for protecting and enforcing the rights and remedies of the bondholders as may be reasonable and proper and not in violation of law, including covenants setting forth the duties of the authority in relation to the exercise of its powers pursuant to sections 15-31a to 15-31i , inclusive, and the custody, safeguarding and application of all moneys. The authority may provide by such trust indenture for the payment of the proceeds of the bonds and the revenues from the operation of the ports and harbors of the state to the trustee under such trust indenture or other depository, and for the method of disbursement thereof, with such safeguards and restrictions as it may determine. All expenses incurred in carrying out such trust indenture may be treated as a part of the operating expenses of the applicable project. If the bonds shall be secured by a trust indenture, the bondholders shall have no authority to appoint a separate trustee to represent them.",
              "(h) In connection with the issuance of bonds to finance a project or to refund bonds previously issued by the authority or the state to finance a project, the authority may create and establish one or more reserve funds to be known as special capital reserve funds and may pay into such special capital reserve funds (1) any moneys appropriated and made available by the state for the purposes of such funds, (2) any proceeds of sale of notes or bonds for a project, to the extent provided in the resolution of the authority authorizing the issuance thereof, and (3) any other moneys which may be made available to the authority for the purpose of such funds from any other source or sources. The moneys held in or credited to any special capital reserve fund established under this section, except as hereinafter provided, shall be used solely for the payment of the principal of and interest on, when due, whether at maturity or by mandatory sinking fund installments, on bonds of the authority secured by such capital reserve fund as the same become due, the purchase of such bonds of the authority, the payment of any redemption premium required to be paid when such bonds are redeemed prior to maturity; provided the authority shall have power to provide that moneys in any such fund shall not be withdrawn therefrom at any time in such amount as would reduce the amount of such funds to less than the maximum amount of principal and interest becoming due by reasons of maturity or a required sinking fund installment in the then current or any succeeding calendar year on the bonds of the authority then outstanding or the maximum amount permitted to be deposited in such fund by the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, or any subsequent corresponding internal revenue code of the United States, as from time to time amended, to permit the interest on said bonds to be excluded from gross income for federal tax purposes and secured by such special capital reserve fund, such amount being herein referred to as the “required minimum capital reserve”, except for the purpose of paying such principal of, redemption premium and interest on such bonds of the authority secured by such special capital reserve becoming due and for the payment of which other moneys of the authority are not available. The authority may provide that it shall not issue bonds secured by a special capital reserve fund at any time if the required minimum capital reserve on the bonds outstanding and the bonds then to be issued and secured by the same special capital reserve fund at the time of issuance, unless the authority, at the time of the issuance of such bonds, shall deposit in such special capital reserve fund from the proceeds of the bonds so to be issued, or otherwise, an amount which, together with the amount then in such special capital reserve fund, will be not less than the required minimum capital reserve. On or before December first, annually, there is deemed to be appropriated from the state General Fund such sums, if any, as shall be certified by the chairperson or vice-chairperson of the authority to the Secretary of the Office of Policy and Management and the Treasurer, as necessary to restore each such special capital reserve fund to the amount equal to the required minimum capital reserve of such fund, and such amounts shall be allotted and paid to the authority. For the purpose of evaluation of any such special capital reserve fund, obligations acquired as an investment for any such fund shall be valued at market. Nothing contained in this section shall preclude the authority from establishing and creating other debt service reserve funds in connection with the issuance of bonds or notes of the authority which are not special capital reserve funds. Subject to any agreement or agreements with holders of outstanding notes and bonds of the authority, any amount or amounts allotted and paid to the authority pursuant to this section shall be repaid to the state from moneys of the authority at such time as such moneys are not required for any other of its corporate purposes and in any event shall be repaid to the state on the date one year after all bonds and notes of the authority theretofore issued on the date or dates such amount or amounts are allotted and paid to the authority or thereafter issued, together with interest on such bonds and notes, with interest on any unpaid installments of interest and all costs and expenses in connection with any action or proceeding by or on behalf of the holders thereof, are fully met and discharged. No bonds secured by a special capital reserve fund shall be issued to pay project costs unless the authority is of the opinion and determines that revenues pledged to secure such bonds shall be sufficient to (A) pay the principal of and interest on the bonds issued to finance the project, (B) establish, increase and maintain any reserves deemed by the authority to be advisable to secure the payment of the principal of and interest on such bonds, (C) pay the cost of maintaining the project in good repair and keeping it properly insured, and (D) pay such other costs of the project as may be required. No bonds secured by a special capital reserve fund shall be issued unless the issuance of such bonds is approved by the Treasurer. Notwithstanding any other provision contained in this section, the aggregate amount of bonds secured by the special capital reserve funds authorized to be created and established by this subsection shall not exceed fifty million dollars.",
              "(i) Any pledge made by the authority shall be valid and binding from the time when the pledge is made, and the revenues or property so pledged and thereafter received by the authority shall immediately be subject to the lien of such pledge without any physical delivery thereof or further act. The lien of any such pledge shall be valid and binding as against all parties having claims of any kind in tort, contract, or otherwise against the authority, irrespective of whether such parties have notice thereof. Neither the resolution nor any other instrument by which a pledge is created need be recorded.",
              "(j) The authority shall have power out of any funds available therefor to purchase bonds or notes of the authority or the state issued pursuant to this section. The authority may hold, pledge, cancel or resell such bonds, subject to and in accordance with agreements with bondholders.",
              "(k) Whether or not the notes and bonds are of such form and character as to be negotiable instruments under the terms of the Uniform Commercial Code, the notes and bonds are hereby made negotiable instruments within the meaning of and for all purposes of the Uniform Commercial Code, subject only to the provisions of the notes and bonds for registration.",
              "(l) Any moneys held by the authority with respect to the ports and harbors of the state or by a trustee pursuant to a trust indenture, subject to the provisions of such indenture, including proceeds from the sale of any bonds and notes, and revenues, receipts and income from the operation of the ports and harbors of the state may be invested and reinvested in such obligations, securities and other investments, including, without limitation, participation certificates in the Short Term Investment Fund created in section 3-27a , or deposited or redeposited in such bank or banks, all as shall be authorized by the authority in the proceedings authorizing the issuance of the bonds and notes.",
              "(m) For the purposes of sections 15-31a to 15-31i , inclusive, the costs of the project payable out of the proceeds of bonds issued pursuant to this section shall include: (1) Expenses and obligations incurred for labor and materials in connection with the construction of the project; (2) the cost of acquiring by purchase, if such purchase shall be deemed expedient, and the amount of any award or final judgment in any proceedings to acquire by condemnation, such land, property rights, rights-of-way, franchises, easements and other interests in land as may be deemed necessary or convenient in connection with such construction or with the operation of the project, and the amount of any damages incident thereto; (3) the costs of all machinery and equipment acquired in connection with the project; (4) reserves for the payment of the principal of and interest on any notes and bonds issued pursuant to this section and interest accruing on any such notes, during construction of the project and for six months after completion of such construction; (5) initial working capital, expenses of administration properly chargeable to the construction or acquisition of the project, legal, architectural and engineering expenses and fees, costs of audits, costs of preparing and issuing any notes and bonds pursuant to this section; and (6) all other items of expense not elsewhere specified incident to the planning, acquisition and construction of the project or of the placing of the same in operation.",
              "(n) For purposes of sections 15-31a to 15-31i , inclusive, the term “project” shall refer to the renovations and improvements to be acquired and constructed at the ports and harbors of the state as may be specified from time to time by the board in a resolution as contemplated by subsection (a) of this section."

All charges necessarily incurred by such person in the performance of such duty shall be a lien upon such aircraft. The owner or keeper of any hangar or other place where such aircraft is stored shall have a lien upon the same for storage charges. If such aircraft has been so stored for a period of ninety days, such owner or keeper may sell the same at public auction for cash, at such owner's or keeper's place of business, and apply the avails of such sale toward the payment of such owner's or keeper's charges and the payment of any debt or obligation incurred by the person who placed the same in storage, provided such sale shall be advertised three times in a newspaper published or having a circulation in the town where such hangar or other place is located, such advertisement to commence at least five days before such sale; and, if the last place of abode of the owner of such aircraft is known to or may be ascertained by such hangar owner or keeper by the exercise of reasonable diligence, notice of the time and place of sale shall be given such owner by mailing such notice to the owner in a registered or certified letter, postage paid, at such last usual place of abode, at least five days before the time of sale. The proceeds of such sale, after deducting the amount due such hangar owner or keeper and all expenses connected with such sale, including the expenses of the officer who placed such aircraft in storage, shall be paid to the owner of such aircraft or the owner's legal representatives, if claimed by such owner or representatives, at any time within one year from the date of such sale. If such balance is not claimed within such period, it shall escheat to the authority.\n\n(b) If the owner of such aircraft placed in storage in accordance with the provisions of this section fails to claim such aircraft within sixty days, the owner of such hangar or other place of storage shall, within thirty days thereafter, send a written notice to the executive director, stating the make, type, engine number and identification number of such aircraft and the date such aircraft was left with such owner for storage and by whom, which notice shall be placed on file by the executive director and shall be subject to public inspection. Any sale under the provisions of this section shall be void, unless the notice required by this section has been given to the executive director."

              "(b) Special obligations of state. Bonds issued pursuant to this section shall be special obligations of the state and shall not be payable from nor charged upon any funds other than the revenues pledged to the payment thereof, nor shall the state or any political subdivision thereof be subject to any liability thereon except to the extent of such pledged revenues. The issuance of bonds under the provisions of sections 15-101k to 15-101p , inclusive, shall not directly or indirectly or contingently obligate the state or any political subdivision thereof to levy or to pledge any form of taxation whatever therefor or to make any appropriation for their payment. The bonds shall not constitute a charge, lien or encumbrance, legal or equitable, upon any property of the state or of any political subdivision thereof, except the property mortgaged or otherwise encumbered under the provisions and for the purposes of sections 15-101k to 15-101p , inclusive. The substance of such limitation shall be plainly stated on the face of each bond.

The State Bond Commission shall determine the form of the bonds, including any interest coupons to be attached thereto, the manner of execution of the bonds, the denomination or denominations of the bonds and the place or places of payment of principal and interest, which may be at any bank or trust company within or without the state. Prior to the preparation of definitive bonds, the State Bond Commission may, under like restrictions, provide for the issuance of interim receipts or temporary bonds, with or without coupons, exchangeable for definitive bonds when such bonds have been executed and are available for delivery. If any of the officers whose signatures appear on the bonds or coupons cease to be officers before the delivery of any such bonds, such signatures shall, nevertheless, be valid and sufficient for all purposes, the same as if they had remained in office until delivery.",

Any bonds issued under the authority of sections 15-101k to 15-101p , inclusive, may be sold at public sale on sealed proposals or by negotiation in such manner, at such price and at such time or times as may be determined by the Treasurer to be most advantageous, subject to the approval of the State Bond Commission.

              "(f) Agreements and provisions in instruments securing bonds. The proceedings under which the bonds are authorized to be issued pursuant to this section, and any mortgage given to secure the same, may, subject to the provisions of the general statutes, contain any agreements and provisions customarily contained in instruments securing bonds, including, but not limited to: (1) Provisions respecting custody of the proceeds from the sale of the bonds, including their investment and reinvestment until used for the cost of the project; (2) provisions respecting the fixing and collection of rents or payments with respect to the facilities of Bradley International Airport and the application and use of passenger facility charges; (3) the terms to be incorporated in the lease, sale contract or loan agreement with respect to the project; (4) the maintenance and insurance of the project; (5) the creation, maintenance, custody, investment and reinvestment and use of the revenues derived from the operation of Bradley International Airport; (6) establishment of reserves or sinking funds, and such accounts thereunder as may be established by the State Bond Commission, and the regulation and disposition thereof; (7) the rights and remedies available in case of a default to the bondholders or to any trustee under any lease, sale contract, loan agreement, mortgage or trust indenture; (8) reimbursement agreements remarketing agreements, standby bond purchase agreements or similar agreements in connection with obtaining any credit or liquidity facilities including, but not limited to, letters of credit or policies of bond insurance and such other agreements entered into pursuant to section 3-20a ; (9) provisions for the issuance of additional bonds on a parity with bonds theretofore issued, including establishment of coverage requirements with respect thereto; (10) covenants to do or to refrain from doing such acts and things as may be necessary or convenient or desirable in order to better secure any bonds or to maintain any federal or state exemption from tax of the interest on such bonds; and (11) provisions or covenants of like or different character from the foregoing which are consistent with the provisions of this chapter and which the State Bond Commission determines in such proceedings are necessary, convenient or desirable in order to better secure the bonds or bond anticipation notes, or will tend to make the bonds or bond anticipation notes more marketable, and which are in the best interests of the state. The proceedings under which the bonds are authorized, and any mortgage given to secure the same, may further provide that any cash balances not necessary (A) to pay the cost of maintaining, repairing and operating the facilities of Bradley International Airport, (B) to pay the principal of and interest on the bonds as the same shall become due and payable, and (C) to create and maintain reserve and sinking funds as provided in any authorizing resolution, or other proceedings shall be deposited into a Bradley International Airport working fund to be held in trust by the treasurer and applied to future debt service requirements or other general airport purposes.",
              "(g) Trust indenture. In the discretion of the State Bond Commission, bonds issued pursuant to this section may be secured by a trust indenture by and between the state and a corporate trustee, which may be any trust company or bank having the powers of a trust company within or without the state. Such trust indenture may contain such provisions for protecting and enforcing the rights and remedies of the bondholders as may be reasonable and proper and not in violation of law, including covenants setting forth the duties of the state in relation to the exercise of its powers pursuant to sections 15-101k to 15-101p , inclusive, and the custody, safeguarding and application of all moneys. The state may provide by such trust indenture for the payment of the proceeds of the bonds and the revenues from the operation of Bradley International Airport to the trustee under such trust indenture or other depository, and for the method of disbursement thereof, with such safeguards and restrictions as it may determine. All expenses incurred in carrying out such trust indenture may be treated as a part of the operating expenses of the project. If the bonds shall be secured by a trust indenture, the bondholders shall have no authority to appoint a separate trustee to represent them.",
              "(h) Validity of pledge. Any pledge made by the state shall be valid and binding from the time when the pledge is made, and the revenues or property so pledged and thereafter received by the state shall immediately be subject to the lien of such pledge without any physical delivery thereof or further act. The lien of any such pledge shall be valid and binding as against all parties having claims of any kind in tort, contract, or otherwise against the state, irrespective of whether such parties have notice thereof. Neither the resolution nor any other instrument by which a pledge is created need be recorded.",
              "(i) Treasurer may purchase bonds or notes. The Treasurer shall have power out of any funds available therefor to purchase bonds or notes of the state issued pursuant to this section and section 15-101n . The Treasurer may hold, pledge, cancel or resell such bonds, subject to and in accordance with agreements with bondholders.",
              "(j) Negotiable instruments. Whether or not the notes and bonds are of such form and character as to be negotiable instruments under the terms of the Uniform Commercial Code, the notes and bonds are hereby made negotiable instruments within the meaning of and for all purposes of the Uniform Commercial Code, subject only to the provisions of the notes and bonds for registration.",
              "(k) Investment of moneys.

The proceedings under which the bonds are authorized to be issued pursuant to this section, and any mortgage given to secure the same, may, subject to the provisions of the general statutes, contain any agreements and provisions customarily contained in instruments securing bonds, including, but not limited to: (1) Provisions respecting custody of the proceeds from the sale of the bonds, including their investment and reinvestment until used for the cost of the project; (2) provisions respecting the fixing and collection of rents or payments with respect to the facilities of Bradley International Airport and the application and use of passenger facility charges; (3) the terms to be incorporated in the lease, sale contract or loan agreement with respect to the project; (4) the maintenance and insurance of the project; (5) the creation, maintenance, custody, investment and reinvestment and use of the revenues derived from the operation of Bradley International Airport; (6) establishment of reserves or sinking funds, and such accounts thereunder as may be established by the State Bond Commission, and the regulation and disposition thereof; (7) the rights and remedies available in case of a default to the bondholders or to any trustee under any lease, sale contract, loan agreement, mortgage or trust indenture; (8) reimbursement agreements remarketing agreements, standby bond purchase agreements or similar agreements in connection with obtaining any credit or liquidity facilities including, but not limited to, letters of credit or policies of bond insurance and such other agreements entered into pursuant to section 3-20a ; (9) provisions for the issuance of additional bonds on a parity with bonds theretofore issued, including establishment of coverage requirements with respect thereto; (10) covenants to do or to refrain from doing such acts and things as may be necessary or convenient or desirable in order to better secure any bonds or to maintain any federal or state exemption from tax of the interest on such bonds; and (11) provisions or covenants of like or different character from the foregoing which are consistent with the provisions of this chapter and which the State Bond Commission determines in such proceedings are necessary, convenient or desirable in order to better secure the bonds or bond anticipation notes, or will tend to make the bonds or bond anticipation notes more marketable, and which are in the best interests of the state. The proceedings under which the bonds are authorized, and any mortgage given to secure the same, may further provide that any cash balances not necessary (A) to pay the cost of maintaining, repairing and operating the facilities of Bradley International Airport, (B) to pay the principal of and interest on the bonds as the same shall become due and payable, and (C) to create and maintain reserve and sinking funds as provided in any authorizing resolution, or other proceedings shall be deposited into a Bradley International Airport working fund to be held in trust by the treasurer and applied to future debt service requirements or other general airport purposes.\n\n(g) Trust indenture. In the discretion of the State Bond Commission, bonds issued pursuant to this section may be secured by a trust indenture by and between the state and a corporate trustee, which may be any trust company or bank having the powers of a trust company within or without the state. Such trust indenture may contain such provisions for protecting and enforcing the rights and remedies of the bondholders as may be reasonable and proper and not in violation of law, including covenants setting forth the duties of the state in relation to the exercise of its powers pursuant to sections 15-101k to 15-101p , inclusive, and the custody, safeguarding and application of all moneys. The state may provide by such trust indenture for the payment of the proceeds of the bonds and the revenues from the operation of Bradley International Airport to the trustee under such trust indenture or other depository, and for the method of disbursement thereof, with such safeguards and restrictions as it may determine. All expenses incurred in carrying out such trust indenture may be treated as a part of the operating expenses of the project. If the bonds shall be secured by a trust indenture, the bondholders shall have no authority to appoint a separate trustee to represent them.\n\n(h) Validity of pledge. Any pledge made by the state shall be valid and binding from the time when the pledge is made, and the revenues or property so pledged and thereafter received by the state shall immediately be subject to the lien of such pledge without any physical delivery thereof or further act. The lien of any such pledge shall be valid and binding as against all parties having claims of any kind in tort, contract, or otherwise against the state, irrespective of whether such parties have notice thereof. Neither the resolution nor any other instrument by which a pledge is created need be recorded.\n\n(i) Treasurer may purchase bonds or notes. The Treasurer shall have power out of any funds available therefor to purchase bonds or notes of the state issued pursuant to this section and section 15-101n . The Treasurer may hold, pledge, cancel or resell such bonds, subject to and in accordance with agreements with bondholders.\n\n(j) Negotiable instruments. Whether or not the notes and bonds are of such form and character as to be negotiable instruments under the terms of the Uniform Commercial Code, the notes and bonds are hereby made negotiable instruments within the meaning of and for all purposes of the Uniform Commercial Code, subject only to the provisions of the notes and bonds for registration.\n\n(k) Investment of moneys. Any moneys held by the Treasurer with respect to Bradley International Airport, or by a trustee pursuant to a trust indenture, subject to the provisions of such indenture, including proceeds from the sale of any bonds and notes, and revenues, receipts and income from the operation of Bradley International Airport may be invested and reinvested in such obligations, securities, and other investments, including without limitation participation certificates in the Short Term Investment Fund created in section 3-27a , or deposited or redeposited in such bank or banks, all as shall be authorized by the State Bond Commission in the proceedings authorizing the issuance of the bonds and notes.\n\n(l) Costs payable out of proceeds. For the purposes of sections 15-101k to 15-101p , inclusive, the costs of the project payable out of the proceeds of bonds issued pursuant to this section shall include: (i) Expenses and obligations incurred for labor and materials in connection with the construction of the project; (ii) the cost of acquiring by purchase, if such purchase shall be deemed expedient, and the amount of any award or final judgment in any proceedings to acquire by condemnation, such land, property rights, rights-of-way, franchises, easements and other interests in land as may be deemed necessary or convenient in connection with such construction or with the operation of the project, and the amount of any damages incident thereto; (iii) the costs of all machinery and equipment acquired in connection with the project; (iv) reserves for the payment of the principal of and interest on any notes and bonds issued pursuant to this section and section 15-101n , and interest accruing on any such notes, during construction of the project and for six months after completion of such construction; (v) initial working capital, expenses of administration properly chargeable to the construction or acquisition of the project, legal, architectural and engineering expenses and fees, costs of audits, costs of preparing and issuing any notes and bonds pursuant to this section and section 15-101n ; and (vi) all other items of expense not elsewhere specified incident to the planning, acquisition and construction of the project or of the placing of the same in operation.\n\n(m) Request for authorization by secretary. None of the bonds authorized pursuant to this section shall be issued and sold except upon a finding by the State Bond Commission that there has been filed with it a request for such authorization, which is signed by the Secretary of the Office of Policy and Management or on said secretary's behalf and stating such terms and conditions as said commission, in its discretion, may require.\n\n(n) Definition of “project”. For purposes of sections 15-101k to 15-101p , inclusive, the term “project” shall refer to the renovations and improvements to be acquired and constructed at Bradley International Airport as may be specified from time to time by the board in a resolution as contemplated by subsection (a) of this section."

The proceedings under which the bonds are authorized, and any mortgage given to secure the same, may further provide that any cash balances not necessary (A) to pay the cost of maintaining, repairing and operating the facilities of Bradley, the general aviation airports and any other airports, (B) to pay the principal of and interest on the bonds as the same shall become due and payable, and (C) to create and maintain reserve and sinking funds as provided in any authorizing resolution or other proceedings shall be deposited into one or more specifically designated working funds to be held in trust by the authority and applied to future debt service requirements or other airport purposes.",

Such trust indenture may contain such provisions for protecting and enforcing the rights and remedies of the bondholders as may be reasonable and proper and not in violation of law, including covenants setting forth the duties of the authority in relation to the exercise of its powers pursuant to sections 15-120aa to 15-120oo , inclusive, and the custody, safeguarding and application of all moneys. The authority may provide by such trust indenture for the payment of the proceeds of the bonds and the revenues from the operation of Bradley or general aviation airports or any other airports to the trustee under such trust indenture or other depository, and for the method of disbursement thereof, with such safeguards and restrictions as it may determine. All expenses incurred in carrying out such trust indenture may be treated as a part of the operating expenses of the applicable project. If the bonds shall be secured by a trust indenture, the bondholders shall have no authority to appoint a separate trustee to represent them.",
              "(h) In connection with the issuance of bonds to finance a project or to refund bonds previously issued by the authority or the state to finance a project, the authority may create and establish one or more reserve funds to be known as special capital reserve funds and may pay into such special capital reserve funds (1) any moneys appropriated and made available by the state for the purposes of such funds, (2) any proceeds of sale of notes or bonds for a project, to the extent provided in the resolution of the authority authorizing the issuance thereof, and (3) any other moneys which may be made available to the authority for the purpose of such funds from any other source or sources. The moneys held in or credited to any special capital reserve fund established under this section, except as hereinafter provided, shall be used solely for the payment of the principal of and interest on, when due, whether at maturity or by mandatory sinking fund installments, on bonds of the authority secured by such capital reserve fund as the same become due, the purchase of such bonds of the authority, the payment of any redemption premium required to be paid when such bonds are redeemed prior to maturity; provided the authority shall have power to provide that moneys in any such fund shall not be withdrawn therefrom at any time in such amount as would reduce the amount of such funds to less than the maximum amount of principal and interest becoming due by reasons of maturity or a required sinking fund installment in the then current or any succeeding calendar year on the bonds of the authority then outstanding or the maximum amount permitted to be deposited in such fund by the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, or any subsequent corresponding internal revenue code of the United States, as from time to time amended, to permit the interest on said bonds to be excluded from gross income for federal tax purposes and secured by such special capital reserve fund, such amount being herein referred to as the “required minimum capital reserve”, except for the purpose of paying such principal of, redemption premium and interest on such bonds of the authority secured by such special capital reserve becoming due and for the payment of which other moneys of the authority are not available. The authority may provide that it shall not issue bonds secured by a special capital reserve fund at any time if the required minimum capital reserve on the bonds outstanding and the bonds then to be issued and secured by the same special capital reserve fund at the time of issuance, unless the authority, at the time of the issuance of such bonds, shall deposit in such special capital reserve fund from the proceeds of the bonds so to be issued, or otherwise, an amount which, together with the amount then in such special capital reserve fund, will be not less than the required minimum capital reserve. On or before December first, annually, there is deemed to be appropriated from the state General Fund such sums, if any, as shall be certified by the chairperson or vice chairperson of the authority to the Secretary of the Office of Policy and Management and the Treasurer, as necessary to restore each such special capital reserve fund to the amount equal to the required minimum capital reserve of such fund, and such amounts shall be allotted and paid to the authority. For the purpose of evaluation of any such special capital reserve fund, obligations acquired as an investment for any such fund shall be valued at market. Nothing contained in this section shall preclude the authority from establishing and creating other debt service reserve funds in connection with the issuance of bonds or notes of the authority which are not special capital reserve funds. Subject to any agreement or agreements with holders of outstanding notes and bonds of the authority, any amount or amounts allotted and paid to the authority pursuant to this section shall be repaid to the state from moneys of the authority at such time as such moneys are not required for any other of its corporate purposes and in any event shall be repaid to the state on the date one year after all bonds and notes of the authority theretofore issued on the date or dates such amount or amounts are allotted and paid to the authority or thereafter issued, together with interest on such bonds and notes, with interest on any unpaid installments of interest and all costs and expenses in connection with any action or proceeding by or on behalf of the holders thereof, are fully met and discharged. No bonds secured by a special capital reserve fund shall be issued to pay project costs unless the authority is of the opinion and determines that revenues pledged to secure such bonds shall be sufficient to (A) pay the principal of and interest on the bonds issued to finance the project, (B) establish, increase and maintain any reserves deemed by the authority to be advisable to secure the payment of the principal of and interest on such bonds, (C) pay the cost of maintaining the project in good repair and keeping it properly insured, and (D) pay such other costs of the project as may be required. No bonds secured by a special capital reserve fund shall be issued unless the issuance of such bonds is approved by the Treasurer.",
              "(i) Any pledge made by the authority shall be valid and binding from the time when the pledge is made, and the revenues or property so pledged and thereafter received by the authority shall immediately be subject to the lien of such pledge without any physical delivery thereof or further act. The lien of any such pledge shall be valid and binding as against all parties having claims of any kind in tort, contract, or otherwise against the authority, irrespective of whether such parties have notice thereof. Neither the resolution nor any other instrument by which a pledge is created need be recorded.",
              "(j) The authority shall have power out of any funds available therefor to purchase bonds or notes of the authority or the state issued pursuant to this section and section 15-101n . The authority may hold, pledge, cancel or resell such bonds, subject to and in accordance with agreements with bondholders.",
              "(k) Whether or not the notes and bonds are of such form and character as to be negotiable instruments under the terms of the Uniform Commercial Code, the notes and bonds are hereby made negotiable instruments within the meaning of and for all purposes of the Uniform Commercial Code, subject only to the provisions of the notes and bonds for registration.",
              "(l) Any moneys held by the authority with respect to Bradley, the general aviation airports and any other airports, or by a trustee pursuant to a trust indenture, subject to the provisions of such indenture, including proceeds from the sale of any bonds and notes, and revenues, receipts and income from the operation of Bradley, the general aviation airports and any other airports, may be invested and reinvested in such obligations, securities and other investments, including, without limitation, participation certificates in the Short Term Investment Fund created in section 3-27a , or deposited or redeposited in such bank or banks, all as shall be authorized by the authority in the proceedings authorizing the issuance of the bonds and notes.",
              "(m) For the purposes of sections 15-120aa to 15-120oo , inclusive, the costs of the project payable out of the proceeds of bonds issued pursuant to this section shall include: (1) Expenses and obligations incurred for labor and materials in connection with the construction of the project; (2) the cost of acquiring by purchase, if such purchase shall be deemed expedient, and the amount of any award or final judgment in any proceedings to acquire by condemnation, such land, property rights, rights-of-way, franchises, easements and other interests in land as may be deemed necessary or convenient in connection with such construction or with the operation of the project, and the amount of any damages incident thereto; (3) the costs of all machinery and equipment acquired in connection with the project; (4) reserves for the payment of the principal of and interest on any notes and bonds issued pursuant to this section and section 15-101n and interest accruing on any such notes, during construction of the project and for six months after completion of such construction; (5) initial working capital, expenses of administration properly chargeable to the construction or acquisition of the project, legal, architectural and engineering expenses and fees, costs of audits, costs of preparing and issuing any notes and bonds pursuant to this section and section 15-101n ; and (6) all other items of expense not elsewhere specified incident to the planning, acquisition and construction of the project or of the placing of the same in operation.",

The authority may pay from the proceeds of the bonds all costs and expenses which the authority may deem necessary or advantageous in connection with the authorization, sale and issuance thereof, including the cost of interest on any short-term financing authorized under subsection (b) of section 15-120gg .\n\n(e) The principal of and interest on any bonds issued pursuant to this section shall be secured by a pledge of the revenues out of which such bonds shall be made payable. They may be secured by a mortgage covering all or any part of the project from which the revenues so pledged may be derived or by a pledge of one or more leases, sale contracts or loan agreements with respect to such project or by a pledge of one or more notes, debentures, bonds or other secured or unsecured debt obligations of any lessee or contracting party under a loan agreement or sale contract or by a pledge of reserve and sinking funds established pursuant to the resolution authorizing the issuance of the bonds and any other funds and accounts, including proceeds from investment of any of the foregoing, established pursuant to this chapter or the proceedings authorizing the issuance of such bonds, and by moneys paid under a credit facility, including, but not limited to, a letter of credit or policy of bond insurance, issued by a financial institution pursuant to an agreement authorized by such proceedings.\n\n(f) The proceedings under which the bonds are authorized to be issued pursuant to this section, and any mortgage given to secure the same, may, subject to the provisions of the general statutes, contain any agreements and provisions customarily contained in instruments securing bonds, including, but not limited to: (1) Provisions respecting custody of the proceeds from the sale of the bonds, including their investment and reinvestment until used for the cost of the project; (2) provisions respecting the fixing and collection of rents or payments with respect to the facilities of Bradley, the general aviation airports and any other airports, and the application and use of passenger facility charges; (3) the terms to be incorporated in the lease, sale contract or loan agreement with respect to the project; (4) the maintenance and insurance of the project; (5) the creation, maintenance, custody, investment and reinvestment, and use of the revenues derived from the operation of Bradley, the general aviation airports and any other airports; (6) establishment of reserves or sinking funds, and such accounts thereunder as may be established by the authority, and the regulation and disposition thereof; (7) the rights and remedies available in case of a default to the bondholders or to any trustee under any lease, sale contract, loan agreement, mortgage or trust indenture; (8) reimbursement agreements, remarketing agreements, standby bond purchase agreements or similar agreements in connection with obtaining any credit or liquidity facilities including, but not limited to, letters of credit or policies of bond insurance and such other agreements entered into pursuant to section 3-20a ; (9) provisions for the issuance of additional bonds on a parity with bonds theretofore issued, including establishment of coverage requirements with respect thereto; (10) covenants to do or to refrain from doing such acts and things as may be necessary or convenient or desirable in order to better secure any bonds or to maintain any federal or state exemption from tax of the interest on such bonds; and (11) provisions or covenants of like or different character from the foregoing which are consistent with the provisions of this chapter and which the authority determines in such proceedings are necessary, convenient or desirable in order to better secure the bonds or bond anticipation notes, or will tend to make the bonds or bond anticipation notes more marketable, and which are in the best interests of the state. The proceedings under which the bonds are authorized, and any mortgage given to secure the same, may further provide that any cash balances not necessary (A) to pay the cost of maintaining, repairing and operating the facilities of Bradley, the general aviation airports and any other airports, (B) to pay the principal of and interest on the bonds as the same shall become due and payable, and (C) to create and maintain reserve and sinking funds as provided in any authorizing resolution or other proceedings shall be deposited into one or more specifically designated working funds to be held in trust by the authority and applied to future debt service requirements or other airport purposes.\n\n(g) In the discretion of the authority, bonds issued pursuant to this section may be secured by a trust indenture by and between the authority and a corporate trustee, which may be any trust company or bank having the powers of a trust company within or without the state. Such trust indenture may contain such provisions for protecting and enforcing the rights and remedies of the bondholders as may be reasonable and proper and not in violation of law, including covenants setting forth the duties of the authority in relation to the exercise of its powers pursuant to sections 15-120aa to 15-120oo , inclusive, and the custody, safeguarding and application of all moneys. The authority may provide by such trust indenture for the payment of the proceeds of the bonds and the revenues from the operation of Bradley or general aviation airports or any other airports to the trustee under such trust indenture or other depository, and for the method of disbursement thereof, with such safeguards and restrictions as it may determine. All expenses incurred in carrying out such trust indenture may be treated as a part of the operating expenses of the applicable project. If the bonds shall be secured by a trust indenture, the bondholders shall have no authority to appoint a separate trustee to represent them.\n\n(h) In connection with the issuance of bonds to finance a project or to refund bonds previously issued by the authority or the state to finance a project, the authority may create and establish one or more reserve funds to be known as special capital reserve funds and may pay into such special capital reserve funds (1) any moneys appropriated and made available by the state for the purposes of such funds, (2) any proceeds of sale of notes or bonds for a project, to the extent provided in the resolution of the authority authorizing the issuance thereof, and (3) any other moneys which may be made available to the authority for the purpose of such funds from any other source or sources. The moneys held in or credited to any special capital reserve fund established under this section, except as hereinafter provided, shall be used solely for the payment of the principal of and interest on, when due, whether at maturity or by mandatory sinking fund installments, on bonds of the authority secured by such capital reserve fund as the same become due, the purchase of such bonds of the authority, the payment of any redemption premium required to be paid when such bonds are redeemed prior to maturity; provided the authority shall have power to provide that moneys in any such fund shall not be withdrawn therefrom at any time in such amount as would reduce the amount of such funds to less than the maximum amount of principal and interest becoming due by reasons of maturity or a required sinking fund installment in the then current or any succeeding calendar year on the bonds of the authority then outstanding or the maximum amount permitted to be deposited in such fund by the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, or any subsequent corresponding internal revenue code of the United States, as from time to time amended, to permit the interest on said bonds to be excluded from gross income for federal tax purposes and secured by such special capital reserve fund, such amount being herein referred to as the “required minimum capital reserve”, except for the purpose of paying such principal of, redemption premium and interest on such bonds of the authority secured by such special capital reserve becoming due and for the payment of which other moneys of the authority are not available. The authority may provide that it shall not issue bonds secured by a special capital reserve fund at any time if the required minimum capital reserve on the bonds outstanding and the bonds then to be issued and secured by the same special capital reserve fund at the time of issuance, unless the authority, at the time of the issuance of such bonds, shall deposit in such special capital reserve fund from the proceeds of the bonds so to be issued, or otherwise, an amount which, together with the amount then in such special capital reserve fund, will be not less than the required minimum capital reserve. On or before December first, annually, there is deemed to be appropriated from the state General Fund such sums, if any, as shall be certified by the chairperson or vice chairperson of the authority to the Secretary of the Office of Policy and Management and the Treasurer, as necessary to restore each such special capital reserve fund to the amount equal to the required minimum capital reserve of such fund, and such amounts shall be allotted and paid to the authority. For the purpose of evaluation of any such special capital reserve fund, obligations acquired as an investment for any such fund shall be valued at market. Nothing contained in this section shall preclude the authority from establishing and creating other debt service reserve funds in connection with the issuance of bonds or notes of the authority which are not special capital reserve funds. Subject to any agreement or agreements with holders of outstanding notes and bonds of the authority, any amount or amounts allotted and paid to the authority pursuant to this section shall be repaid to the state from moneys of the authority at such time as such moneys are not required for any other of its corporate purposes and in any event shall be repaid to the state on the date one year after all bonds and notes of the authority theretofore issued on the date or dates such amount or amounts are allotted and paid to the authority or thereafter issued, together with interest on such bonds and notes, with interest on any unpaid installments of interest and all costs and expenses in connection with any action or proceeding by or on behalf of the holders thereof, are fully met and discharged. No bonds secured by a special capital reserve fund shall be issued to pay project costs unless the authority is of the opinion and determines that revenues pledged to secure such bonds shall be sufficient to (A) pay the principal of and interest on the bonds issued to finance the project, (B) establish, increase and maintain any reserves deemed by the authority to be advisable to secure the payment of the principal of and interest on such bonds, (C) pay the cost of maintaining the project in good repair and keeping it properly insured, and (D) pay such other costs of the project as may be required. No bonds secured by a special capital reserve fund shall be issued unless the issuance of such bonds is approved by the Treasurer.\n\n(i) Any pledge made by the authority shall be valid and binding from the time when the pledge is made, and the revenues or property so pledged and thereafter received by the authority shall immediately be subject to the lien of such pledge without any physical delivery thereof or further act. The lien of any such pledge shall be valid and binding as against all parties having claims of any kind in tort, contract, or otherwise against the authority, irrespective of whether such parties have notice thereof. Neither the resolution nor any other instrument by which a pledge is created need be recorded.\n\n(j) The authority shall have power out of any funds available therefor to purchase bonds or notes of the authority or the state issued pursuant to this section and section 15-101n . The authority may hold, pledge, cancel or resell such bonds, subject to and in accordance with agreements with bondholders.\n\n(k) Whether or not the notes and bonds are of such form and character as to be negotiable instruments under the terms of the Uniform Commercial Code, the notes and bonds are hereby made negotiable instruments within the meaning of and for all purposes of the Uniform Commercial Code, subject only to the provisions of the notes and bonds for registration.\n\n(l) Any moneys held by the authority with respect to Bradley, the general aviation airports and any other airports, or by a trustee pursuant to a trust indenture, subject to the provisions of such indenture, including proceeds from the sale of any bonds and notes, and revenues, receipts and income from the operation of Bradley, the general aviation airports and any other airports, may be invested and reinvested in such obligations, securities and other investments, including, without limitation, participation certificates in the Short Term Investment Fund created in section 3-27a , or deposited or redeposited in such bank or banks, all as shall be authorized by the authority in the proceedings authorizing the issuance of the bonds and notes.\n\n(m) For the purposes of sections 15-120aa to 15-120oo , inclusive, the costs of the project payable out of the proceeds of bonds issued pursuant to this section shall include: (1) Expenses and obligations incurred for labor and materials in connection with the construction of the project; (2) the cost of acquiring by purchase, if such purchase shall be deemed expedient, and the amount of any award or final judgment in any proceedings to acquire by condemnation, such land, property rights, rights-of-way, franchises, easements and other interests in land as may be deemed necessary or convenient in connection with such construction or with the operation of the project, and the amount of any damages incident thereto; (3) the costs of all machinery and equipment acquired in connection with the project; (4) reserves for the payment of the principal of and interest on any notes and bonds issued pursuant to this section and section 15-101n and interest accruing on any such notes, during construction of the project and for six months after completion of such construction; (5) initial working capital, expenses of administration properly chargeable to the construction or acquisition of the project, legal, architectural and engineering expenses and fees, costs of audits, costs of preparing and issuing any notes and bonds pursuant to this section and section 15-101n ; and (6) all other items of expense not elsewhere specified incident to the planning, acquisition and construction of the project or of the placing of the same in operation.\n\n(n) For purposes of sections 15-120aa to 15-120oo , inclusive, the term “project” shall refer to the renovations and improvements to be acquired and constructed at Bradley, the general aviation airports and any other airports as may be specified from time to time by the board in a resolution as contemplated by subsection (a) of this section."

Such process shall apply, in its entirety, only to those abandoned vessels that are not documented according to the maritime or admiralty laws of the United States or for which such documentation is expired or cancelled. The provisions of this subsection shall not apply to vessels that are documented according to the maritime or admiralty laws of the United States except the provisions of subdivisions (1) to (5), inclusive, of this subsection.",

The commissioner may suspend such abandoned vessel period for not more than six months for just cause, provided the commissioner shall state, in writing, for publication on such abandoned vessel Internet web site described in subdivision (3) of this subsection, the reason for such suspension and the elements necessary to resume the abandoned vessel period.",
              "(7) On the day following the expiration of the abandoned vessel period, if any person who abandoned such vessel, vessel lienholder or person with a security interest did not contact the commissioner or otherwise failed to remove such abandoned vessel, the commissioner shall issue a notice of assumed ownership, by certified mail, to the party with standing and provide a copy of the notice to the Commissioner of Motor Vehicles by electronic mail. If such abandoned vessel is the subject of a vessel lien or security interest, as filed with the Secretary of the State, the Commissioner of Energy and Environmental Protection shall file a notice of discharge with the Secretary of the State. Such notice shall: (A) Identify the vessel lien or security interest by a file number, (B) describe the vessel by identification number or type, and (C) indicate that a notice of assumed ownership was issued to the party with standing. The notice of assumed ownership shall be a termination of any and all liens and security interests against such vessel and shall satisfy the notice of removal requirements of section 49-56a . Upon issuance of said notice of assumed ownership the party with standing shall be deemed to be the owner of the abandoned vessel, and the original of the notice of assumed ownership shall be prima facie evidence of such ownership. In the event such vessel is titled in this or another state, such notice of assumed ownership shall be prima facie evidence of a transfer, by operation of law, from a titleholder to the party with standing and shall be deemed sufficient documentation to establish the party with standing's ownership interest or right to acquire the ownership interest. The Commissioner of Motor Vehicles shall cancel the existing registration for such vessel and shall note the transfer of ownership to the party with standing in the vessel registration record, if such record exists and is accessible to the Commissioner of Motor Vehicles. If such vessel is registered by a registering agency other than the Department of Motor Vehicles, the Commissioner of Motor Vehicles shall notify such agency, by electronic mail, of the transfer of ownership.",
              "(8) If the person who abandoned such vessel contacts the Commissioner of Energy and Environmental Protection, such person shall have until the last day of the abandoned vessel period described in subdivision (6) of this subsection to remove such abandoned vessel from the property or possession of the party with standing, as applicable. If the person who abandoned such vessel fails to remove such vessel by said day, the Commissioner of Energy and Environmental Protection, in conjunction with the Commissioner of Motor Vehicles, shall cause the registration of the abandoned vessel to be cancelled and shall issue a notice of assumed ownership to the party with standing. The commissioner may suspend the abandoned vessel period, in accordance with subdivision (6) of this subsection, at the request of the person who abandoned the vessel and for just cause shown. The person who abandoned the vessel shall be liable for any property damage caused by the removal of the abandoned vessel that is undertaken pursuant to this subdivision.",
              "(i) For a period of forty-five days following the end of a declared state of emergency that resulted in the widespread displacement of vessels and that was declared to be an emergency by the Governor pursuant to chapter 517, there shall be no fee for the filing of a notice of abandoned vessel, pursuant to subdivision (1) of subsection (h) of this section, and notarization of such notice shall not be required. Notwithstanding sections 1-217 and 14-10 , the commissioner may publish the name of the owner of any such abandoned vessel and town of record, as such information appears on vessel registration records, during the declared emergency and until such time as such vessel is no longer deemed abandoned.",

For the purpose of this subsection, a vessel that is documented with the United States Coast Guard under maritime or admiralty law shall be considered to be registered with the United States Coast Guard.\n\n(c) Only a party with standing or such party's designated agent, as identified in writing by such party with standing on a notification of abandoned vessel, may initiate the abandoned vessel procedures described in this section. For the purpose of this section, the following parties shall have standing:\n\n(1) The owner of the property where the abandoned vessel came to rest or to which the abandoned vessel was made fast;\n\n(2) Any harbormaster, police department, municipality or agent of the state that agrees to accept or process an abandoned vessel;\n\n(3) Any emergency responder, including a responding utility, or any person or firm contracted by a governmental agency to provide emergency services and responding to a bona fide emergency in a declared emergency pursuant to chapter 517 or the aftermath of a declared emergency; and\n\n(4) Any licensed motor vehicle dealer who is authorized to tow or transport, in accordance with section 14-66 , or any professional marine salvager when such dealer or salvager is engaged by any of the persons described in subdivisions (1) to (3), inclusive, of this subsection.\n\n(d) Any party with standing may seek full cost recovery from the person who abandoned the vessel for any unpaid expense incurred as a result of, or incidental to, such vessel abandonment. Any person who acts in good faith and without malicious intent in the processing, storage or movement of any abandoned vessel pursuant to this section shall be immune from civil liability for damage to such vessel.\n\n(e) The Commissioner of Energy and Environmental Protection shall notify the Secretary of the State by electronic mail of the receipt of any notice of abandoned vessel, as described in subsection (h) of this section, for any abandoned vessel currently or previously registered in this state. Such notification shall include a description of the abandoned vessel and shall identify the name of the owner of the vessel, as recorded with the Department of Motor Vehicles, if known. After receipt of any such notification, the Secretary of the State shall provide the Commissioner of Energy and Environmental Protection with copies of: (1) Any financing statement filed with the Secretary of the State for such vessel that names the owner of the vessel as the debtor and that describes the vessel, by identification number or by type, as collateral or that states that the collateral is “all assets” or “all property” of said owner; or (2) any vessel lien against such vessel filed with the Secretary of the State. The Commissioner of Energy and Environmental Protection shall notify all secured parties listed on any such financing statements and any such lienholders, in writing, that such vessel is deemed abandoned. Such notice shall describe the consequences of abandonment, as prescribed by this section, and provide instructions regarding retrieval of such vessel. If such abandoned vessel was documented in accordance with the maritime or admiralty laws of the United States, the Commissioner of Energy and Environmental Protection shall make reasonable efforts to determine whether any lien, ship mortgage or security interest exists against such abandoned vessel and shall make reasonable attempts to notify all lienholders, ship mortgagees and persons with a security interest of the status and location of the abandoned vessel.\n\n(f) (1) Any party with a vessel lien, as filed with the Secretary of the State, may seek a writ of attachment in accordance with the provisions of section 49-55d . Any person with a security interest against an abandoned vessel may take any action permitted by a secured party, in accordance with the provisions of section 42a-9-601 . Any such writ or action shall be at such party's or person's own expense and instituted not later than the issuance of a notice of assumed ownership to such party or person by the Commissioner of Energy and Environmental Protection. If such party or person fails to seek such writ or take action, such party or person shall be deemed to have discharged such lien or security interest. The Commissioner of Energy and Environmental Protection shall file a notice of discharge of any such lien or security interest with the Secretary of the State. Any such discharge notice shall: (A) Identify the vessel lien or security interest by a file number, (B) describe the vessel by identification number or type, and (C) state that a notice of assumed ownership was issued to the party with standing.\n\n(2) Any party with a vessel lien or person with a security interest against an abandoned vessel as filed with an agency of the United States may seek a writ of attachment in accordance with the provisions of section 49-55d or any other applicable provision of federal or state law.\n\n(3) Any vessel lienholder or person with a security interest may request that the Commissioner of Energy and Environmental Protection suspend the abandoned vessel procedures pursuant to subsection (h) of this section for the purpose of arranging for the removal, transport or storage of an abandoned vessel.\n\n(4) Any party with a vessel lien or person with a security interest in the vessel who enters onto property of a party with standing to take an abandoned vessel into custody shall be liable to the applicable party with standing for any damage or physical injury caused by such entry or taking.\n\n(5) Any abandoned vessel, once in the custody of a vessel lienholder or person with a security interest or an agent of a vessel lienholder or such person, shall no longer be deemed to be an abandoned vessel and shall otherwise be processed pursuant to chapter 847.\n\n(g) In the event an abandoned vessel is registered in another state, the Commissioner of Energy and Environmental Protection shall notify the registering agency and any agency of such state that is responsible for recording vessel liens and security interests, by electronic mail, of such vessel's abandonment and shall allow such agencies fifteen business days to return information regarding the owner of record of such vessel and any person who registered or recorded a vessel lien or security interest against such vessel or to otherwise intervene in the abandoned vessel procedures described in this section. If such agencies identify any vessel lienholder or person with a security interest, the commissioner shall make reasonable attempts to notify such vessel lienholder or person. If such registering agency does not provide contact information or otherwise intervene in such procedures not later than fifteen business days after receipt of such notification, any further obligation to identify or contact the last owner of record, vessel lienholder or person with a security interest shall be considered to be waived, unless the abandoned vessel is documented according to the maritime or admiralty laws of the United States, in which case the commissioner may use the information contained in such documentation to identify the last owner of record.\n\n(h) The Commissioner of Energy and Environmental Protection shall establish the following online process for the disposition of abandoned vessels. Such process shall apply, in its entirety, only to those abandoned vessels that are not documented according to the maritime or admiralty laws of the United States or for which such documentation is expired or cancelled. The provisions of this subsection shall not apply to vessels that are documented according to the maritime or admiralty laws of the United States except the provisions of subdivisions (1) to (5), inclusive, of this subsection.\n\n(1) The party with standing shall file a notarized notice of abandoned vessel with the Commissioner of Energy and Environmental Protection in person, by mail, by paid delivery service or electronically, as prescribed by the commissioner. Such filing shall be on forms as prescribed by the commissioner. The fee for filing such notice shall be twenty dollars.\n\n(2) Upon receipt of any such filing, the commissioner shall determine whether such vessel is reported as stolen or missing. If the vessel was reported as stolen or missing, the police department with whom the report was filed, after notification by the commissioner, shall take such vessel into custody or arrange for the return of such vessel to the owner of such vessel at the expense of the person who abandoned such vessel.\n\n(3) The commissioner shall post information regarding the report of the abandoned vessel online, on a publicly accessible abandoned vessel Internet web site. Such information shall be sufficient to identify the abandoned vessel and shall contain, at a minimum and when such information is known, the registration number of such vessel, the make and model of such vessel, the length and color of such vessel, the town and water body nearest to the location of such vessel abandonment and instructions for contacting the commissioner.\n\n(4) The commissioner shall send a certified letter to the person who abandoned such vessel, provided such person can be identified and, in such letter, identify the abandoned vessel, notify the recipient of the consequences of abandonment under the provisions of this section and provide instructions regarding retrieval of such vessel.\n\n(5) The commissioner shall provide to the party with standing a water resistant adhesive label advising that the subject vessel is being processed pursuant to the provisions of this section and that contains instructions on how to contact the commissioner in order to acquire more information or intervene in such procedures. The party with standing shall immediately affix the label to the abandoned vessel in a prominent location in such a manner as to be visible to an approaching person.\n\n(6) A forty-five-day abandoned vessel period shall commence beginning on the date of the first attempt to deliver the certified letter described in subdivision (4) of this subsection. In any case in which a vessel is not registered, such period shall begin when the commissioner posts information regarding the abandoned vessel on the Internet web site described in subdivision (3) of this subsection. The commissioner may suspend such abandoned vessel period for not more than six months for just cause, provided the commissioner shall state, in writing, for publication on such abandoned vessel Internet web site described in subdivision (3) of this subsection, the reason for such suspension and the elements necessary to resume the abandoned vessel period.\n\n(7) On the day following the expiration of the abandoned vessel period, if any person who abandoned such vessel, vessel lienholder or person with a security interest did not contact the commissioner or otherwise failed to remove such abandoned vessel, the commissioner shall issue a notice of assumed ownership, by certified mail, to the party with standing and provide a copy of the notice to the Commissioner of Motor Vehicles by electronic mail. If such abandoned vessel is the subject of a vessel lien or security interest, as filed with the Secretary of the State, the Commissioner of Energy and Environmental Protection shall file a notice of discharge with the Secretary of the State. Such notice shall: (A) Identify the vessel lien or security interest by a file number, (B) describe the vessel by identification number or type, and (C) indicate that a notice of assumed ownership was issued to the party with standing. The notice of assumed ownership shall be a termination of any and all liens and security interests against such vessel and shall satisfy the notice of removal requirements of section 49-56a . Upon issuance of said notice of assumed ownership the party with standing shall be deemed to be the owner of the abandoned vessel, and the original of the notice of assumed ownership shall be prima facie evidence of such ownership. In the event such vessel is titled in this or another state, such notice of assumed ownership shall be prima facie evidence of a transfer, by operation of law, from a titleholder to the party with standing and shall be deemed sufficient documentation to establish the party with standing's ownership interest or right to acquire the ownership interest. The Commissioner of Motor Vehicles shall cancel the existing registration for such vessel and shall note the transfer of ownership to the party with standing in the vessel registration record, if such record exists and is accessible to the Commissioner of Motor Vehicles. If such vessel is registered by a registering agency other than the Department of Motor Vehicles, the Commissioner of Motor Vehicles shall notify such agency, by electronic mail, of the transfer of ownership.\n\n(8) If the person who abandoned such vessel contacts the Commissioner of Energy and Environmental Protection, such person shall have until the last day of the abandoned vessel period described in subdivision (6) of this subsection to remove such abandoned vessel from the property or possession of the party with standing, as applicable. If the person who abandoned such vessel fails to remove such vessel by said day, the Commissioner of Energy and Environmental Protection, in conjunction with the Commissioner of Motor Vehicles, shall cause the registration of the abandoned vessel to be cancelled and shall issue a notice of assumed ownership to the party with standing. The commissioner may suspend the abandoned vessel period, in accordance with subdivision (6) of this subsection, at the request of the person who abandoned the vessel and for just cause shown. The person who abandoned the vessel shall be liable for any property damage caused by the removal of the abandoned vessel that is undertaken pursuant to this subdivision.\n\n(i) For a period of forty-five days following the end of a declared state of emergency that resulted in the widespread displacement of vessels and that was declared to be an emergency by the Governor pursuant to chapter 517, there shall be no fee for the filing of a notice of abandoned vessel, pursuant to subdivision (1) of subsection (h) of this section, and notarization of such notice shall not be required. Notwithstanding sections 1-217 and 14-10 , the commissioner may publish the name of the owner of any such abandoned vessel and town of record, as such information appears on vessel registration records, during the declared emergency and until such time as such vessel is no longer deemed abandoned.\n\n(j) A notice of abandoned vessel, as described in subdivision (1) of subsection (h) of this section, shall be prepared and submitted to the Commissioner of Energy and Environmental Protection for each abandoned vessel, including any vessel that is documented with the United States Coast Guard in accordance with the maritime or admiralty laws of the United States or that is relocated to an abandoned vessel holding area by persons or agents acting in a relief or emergency capacity.\n\n(k) The Commissioner of Energy and Environmental Protection may waive the requirement to contact the person who abandoned such vessel by certified mail, as required by subdivision (4) of subsection (h) of this section, if contact with such person is otherwise established by electronic mail or another suitable means of communication, as determined by the commissioner.\n\n(l) Notwithstanding any provisions of the general statutes, any waste oil, fuel, antifreeze or other hazardous materials stored on an abandoned vessel and incidental to the operation and maintenance of such abandoned vessel shall be deemed household hazardous waste, for the purpose of disposal of such materials, if removed from such abandoned vessel in preparation for the storage, removal or destruction of such abandoned vessel.\n\n(m) Any person who abandons a vessel shall have committed a violation and shall be fined not less than three hundred dollars nor more than five hundred dollars, except if such abandonment occurred during a declared emergency and as a result of the conditions that caused such emergency to be declared."

No person less than sixteen years of age shall operate a JAV. No owner of a personal watercraft or a JAV shall knowingly authorize or permit a person who is less than sixteen years of age who does not have a certificate of personal watercraft operation issued by the commissioner to operate such personal watercraft or JAV on the waters of the state. Notwithstanding the provisions of this section, the commissioner may modify or suspend, by written permission, any age or certification requirement set forth in this section for the purpose of a marine event held pursuant to section 15-140b . In those waters where the United States Coast Guard has jurisdiction over marine events, such permit shall not be valid unless and until the commissioner receives a copy of the United States Coast Guard authorization for a marine event.\n\n(c) A certificate of personal watercraft operation shall be issued under subsection (b) of this section to any applicant who provides proof that such applicant has: (1) Successfully completed a combined course in safe boating operation and safe personal watercraft handling approved by the commissioner, which courses include, but are not limited to, courses offered by the United States Power Squadrons, Coast Guard Auxiliary or other similar organization, (2) been issued or has satisfied the requirements for issuance of a safe boating certificate and successfully completed a course in safe personal watercraft handling approved by the commissioner, which include, but are not limited to, courses offered by the United States Power Squadrons, Coast Guard Auxiliary or other similar organization, or (3) successfully passed an equivalency examination testing knowledge of safe boating operation and safe personal watercraft handling administered by the commissioner.\n\n(d) The commissioner may adopt regulations, in accordance with the provisions of chapter 54, establishing the content of courses in safe personal watercraft handling. Such regulations may include provisions for examinations, issuance of certificates of personal watercraft operation and establishment of a reasonable fee for such course and examination and for the issuance of a certificate and duplicate certificate.\n\n(e) Notwithstanding subsection (b) of this section, any person who purchases a new or used personal watercraft may, upon vessel registration, apply to the Commissioner of Energy and Environmental Protection for a temporary certificate of personal watercraft operation that shall be valid for three months from the date of registration, provided the applicant has successfully completed a course in safe personal watercraft handling prior to application for the temporary certificate. No person shall be issued more than one temporary certificate of personal watercraft operation.\n\n(f) The commissioner may enter into a reciprocal agreement with any other state that has a similar safe personal watercraft handling certificate program that the commissioner deems acceptable for purposes of this subsection.

Within ninety days before its expiration, each marine dealer's, marine engine manufacturer's or marine surveyor's certificate may be renewed upon application and upon payment of the fee prescribed by the commissioner pursuant to this subsection. Each registration number assigned to a marine dealer, marine engine manufacturer or marine surveyor shall remain the same as long as such dealer, manufacturer or surveyor continues, under the same name, in the business described in such dealer's, manufacturer's or surveyor's application affidavit as required pursuant to this subsection.\n\n(c) A marine dealer's registration number shall be displayed in such manner as the Commissioner of Energy and Environmental Protection prescribes on vessels: (1) Operated for the purpose of sale, trade, repair or transport and on any vessel sold by such dealer for not more than five days after the date of such sale, (2) on any vessel used by a marine engine manufacturer for the sole purpose of testing or demonstrating marine engines manufactured or repaired by such person, and (3) on any vessel used by a marine surveyor for the purpose of inspecting, surveying or examining such vessel or associated equipment to assess, monitor and report on the condition of such vessel or associated equipment. Any vessel displaying a marine dealer's registration number shall be presumed to be properly registered.\n\n(d) No marine dealer, marine engine manufacturer or marine surveyor shall (1) rent, or allow or cause to be rented, (2) operate, or allow or cause to be operated, for hire, or (3) use, or allow or cause to be used, for the purpose of conveying passengers or merchandise or freight for hire, any vessel registered with a marine dealer's, marine engine manufacturer's or marine surveyor's number and certificate. No marine dealer or marine engine manufacturer may loan a number certificate to any person except (A) for the purpose of demonstrating a vessel; (B) when a vessel owned by or lawfully in the custody of such person is undergoing repairs; or (C) when such person has purchased a vessel, the registration of which has not yet been completed and in any case for not more than five consecutive days. Each marine dealer or marine engine manufacturer shall keep a record of each loaned number certificate showing the date loaned, the vessel hull identification number (HIN) of the vessel on which such number is displayed, the date returned and the name and address of the person operating any vessel with such loaned number certificate. Such dealer or engine manufacturer shall give a copy of this record to each person to whom such number certificate is loaned, which copy shall be carried in the vessel at all times when operated. This record shall be retained by the dealer or engine manufacturer for a period of six months from the date on which the number certificate was loaned and such record shall be available during business hours for examination by any police officer, marine officer or conservation officer. A marine surveyor shall not loan a number certificate to any person.\n\n(e) Any marine dealer may operate, or cause to be operated by a bona fide full-time employee, a vessel with a marine dealer's registration number (1) while a potential purchaser or customer is aboard, (2) when running a new vessel from an import terminal to the dealer's place of business, (3) when test running a new vessel after receiving it from the manufacturer, (4) when delivering a sold vessel to the new owner, (5) when running a trade-in vessel from a buyer, (6) when test running a trade-in vessel before it is made available for sale, (7) when running a vessel to, and using a vessel in, a fishing tournament, (8) when test running a vessel after repairs, maintenance or winter storage, (9) when used in connection with the business of the marine dealer, (10) when running the vessel to obtain or deliver parts for the repair of the vessel or another vessel, and (11) for the personal use of the marine dealer. Any marine surveyor may operate, or cause to be operated by a bona fide full-time employee, a vessel with a marine dealer's registration number when performing an inspection, survey or examination of such vessel or associated equipment provided the marine surveyor has been contracted by written agreement to perform such work and a copy of the written agreement is carried on the vessel while the marine surveyor's registration number is displayed on the vessel. Each marine dealer and marine surveyor shall maintain a record of the following: (A) Each marine number certificate issued by the commissioner to such dealer, (B) the name, address and occupation of any bona fide full-time employee to whom such certificate has been assigned, (C) the date of assignment of such certificate, and (D) the exact location of each unassigned certificate. For the purposes of this subsection, “bona fide full-time employee” means a person who is employed by a marine dealer or marine surveyor for not less than thirty-five hours per week and who appears on the records of such marine dealer as an employee for whom tax is withheld for Social Security, federal income tax and any other withholding or deductions from salary required by law.\n\n(f) No person may use a vessel with a marine dealer's, marine engine manufacturer's or marine surveyor's registration number for any purpose other than the purposes described in this section. The commissioner may revoke any marine dealer's, marine engine manufacturer's or marine surveyor's registration number under this section if any vessel with a number issued to such dealer, engine manufacturer or surveyor is used in violation of this section."

In the enforcement of this chapter, such officer may arrest, without previous complaint and warrant, any person who fails to comply with the provisions of this chapter. Failure to appear in court pursuant to such arrest, unless excused by the court or the state's attorney or assistant state's attorney, shall constitute sufficient cause for the suspension by the Commissioner of Motor Vehicles of the boat registration of the boat involved for not more than thirty days or until the matter is resolved by the court, whichever is sooner.\n\n(b) When engaged in the enforcement of this chapter and chapter 446k, such officer shall have the authority to stop and board any vessel which is under way or which is moored on the waters of this state for the purposes of (1) examining decals, certificates and other documents, (2) inspecting safety equipment and waste disposal systems, (3) determining if the operation of such vessel exceeds the noise levels established in subsection (b) of section 15-129 , (4) searching when such officer has probable cause to believe that any provision of any law of this state or any rule or regulation of the Department of Energy and Environmental Protection relating to boating or water pollution has been violated, (5) determining compliance with section 15-132a , subsections (d) and (e) of section 15-133 and sections 15-140 l and 15-140n , when such authorized officer has probable cause to believe said section or subsection has been violated, and (6) making arrests.\n\n(c) No person operating a vessel shall refuse to stop such vessel or, if sea conditions make stopping in that area unsafe, refuse to take such vessel to a designated area after being requested or signaled to do so by such officer. Any person operating a vessel who refuses to stop or refuses to take such vessel to the designated area shall have committed an infraction. Any person, when signaled to stop by such officer in a law enforcement vessel using an audible signal device or flashing blue lights, who operates such vessel in disregard of such signal so as to (1) interfere with or endanger the operation of the law enforcement vessel or any other vessel, (2) endanger or cause damage to property or person, or (3) increase or maintain speed in an attempt to escape or elude such law enforcement officer shall be guilty of a class A misdemeanor. If such violation causes the death or serious physical injury of another person, the vessel operator shall be guilty of a class D felony, and such operator's safe boating certificate, certificate of personal watercraft operation or right to operate a vessel that requires a certificate shall be suspended for one year. For any subsequent offense, such operator shall be guilty of a class D felony, except that if any prior offense by such operator under this section caused, and such subsequent offense causes, the death or serious physical injury of another person, such operator shall be guilty of a class D felony for which one year of the sentence imposed may not be suspended or reduced by the court, and such operator's safe boating certificate, certificate of personal watercraft operation or right to operate a vessel that requires a certificate shall be suspended for not less than eighteen months or more than two years. Proof of the registration number of the vessel shall be prima facie evidence in any prosecution that the owner was the operator. For purposes of this subsection, “serious physical injury” means physical injury which creates a substantial risk of death, or which causes serious disfigurement, serious impairment of health or serious loss or impairment of the function of any bodily organ.\n\n(d) Upon the immediate approach of a law enforcement vessel using an audible signal device or flashing blue lights, or a fire rescue vessel using an audible signal device or flashing red or yellow lights, any person operating a vessel shall immediately slow to a speed sufficient to maintain steerage only, shall alter course, within its ability, so as not to inhibit or interfere with the operation of the law enforcement vessel or fire rescue vessel, and shall proceed, unless otherwise directed by an officer in the law enforcement vessel or fire rescue vessel, at a reduced speed until beyond the area of operation of the law enforcement vessel or fire rescue vessel. Any person operating a vessel who wilfully or negligently obstructs or retards any law enforcement or fire rescue vessel answering an emergency call or in pursuit of fleeing law violators shall be fined not more than two hundred fifty dollars.\n\n(e) Any person operating a vessel passing within two hundred feet of a stationary law enforcement vessel using an audible signal device or flashing blue lights, or a stationary fire rescue vessel using flashing red or yellow lights shall reduce speed to a speed of slow-no-wake until there is a distance of more than two hundred feet between such person's vessel and the law enforcement vessel or fire rescue vessel. Any person operating a vessel passing within two hundred feet of a commercial vessel responding to or towing a vessel in distress when such commercial vessel is displaying flashing red or yellow lights shall reduce speed to a speed of slow-no-wake. For purposes of this subsection, “slow-no-wake” means operation of a vessel at a speed that does not produce more than a minimum wake and is not greater than six miles per hour over ground, unless a higher minimum speed is necessary to maintain steerage when traveling with a strong current.\n\n(f) A person who violates subsection (e) of this section shall be fined not less than fifty dollars or more than two hundred dollars.\n\n(g) The Commissioner of Energy and Environmental Protection shall publish an enforcement manual, conduct training and educational sessions, serve as liaison between the enforcement groups and the Superior Court and shall be generally responsible for the overall coordination of enforcement."

The application shall be signed by an owner of the vessel or by the secured party and shall include:\n\n(1) The name of the owner of record;\n\n(2) The name and mailing address of the secured party;\n\n(3) The hull identification number for the vessel; and\n\n(4) If the department has created a written certificate of title for the vessel, the certificate of title.\n\n(d) A security interest perfected under subsection (c) of this section shall be perfected on the later of delivery to the department of the application and all applicable fees or attachment of the security interest under section 42a-9-203 .\n\n(e) On delivery of an application that complies with subsection (c) of this section and payment of all applicable fees, the department shall create a new certificate of title pursuant to section 15-208 and deliver the new certificate of title or a record evidencing an electronic certificate of title pursuant to subsection (a) of section 15-211 . The department shall maintain in its files the date and time of delivery of the application to the department.\n\n(f) If a secured party assigns a perfected security interest in a vessel, the receipt by the department of a statement providing the name of the assignee as secured party shall not be required to continue the perfected status of the security interest against creditors of and transferees from the original debtor. A purchaser of a vessel subject to a security interest which obtains a release from the secured party indicated in the files of the department or on the certificate of title takes free of the security interest and of the rights of a transferee unless the transfer is indicated in the files of the department or on the certificate of title.\n\n(g) The provisions of this section shall not apply to a security interest:\n\n(1) Created in a vessel by a person during any period in which the vessel is inventory held for sale or lease by the person or is leased by the person as lessor if the person is in the business of selling vessels;\n\n(2) In a barge or any other vessel for which a certificate of title is not permitted under sections 15-201 to 15-232 , inclusive; or\n\n(3) In a vessel before delivery if the vessel is under construction, or completed, pursuant to contract and for which no application for a certificate of title has been delivered to the department.\n\n(h) When a certificate of documentation for a documented vessel is deleted or canceled, if a security interest in the vessel was valid immediately before deletion or cancellation against a third party as a result of compliance with 46 USC 31321, the security interest is and remains perfected until the earlier of four months after deletion or cancellation of the certificate or the time the security interest becomes perfected under this section.\n\n(i) A security interest in a vessel arising under section 42a-2-401 or 42a-2-505 , subdivision (3) of section 42a-2-711 or subsection (d) of section 42a-2A-724 shall be perfected when it attaches but shall become unperfected when the debtor obtains possession of the vessel, unless before the debtor obtains possession the security interest is perfected pursuant to subsection (a) or (c) of this section.\n\n(j) A security interest in a vessel as proceeds of other collateral shall be perfected to the extent provided in section 42a-9-315 .\n\n(k) A security interest in a vessel perfected under the law of another jurisdiction shall be perfected to the extent provided in subsection (d) of section 42a-9-316 ."
