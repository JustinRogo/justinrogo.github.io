              "(a) If, upon review, investigation or inspection, the Commissioner of Public Health determines that a water company has violated any provision of section 25-32 , section 25-32d or any regulation adopted under section 25-32d , or any provision of this title or title 19 or any regulation promulgated pursuant to said titles that relate to the purity and adequacy of water supplies or to the testing of water supplies or any report of such testing, the commissioner may impose a civil penalty not to exceed five thousand dollars per violation per day upon such water company. Governmental immunity shall not be a defense against the imposition of any civil penalty imposed pursuant to this section. In establishing a schedule or schedules of the amounts, or the ranges of amounts, of civil penalties which may be imposed under this section, the commissioner shall consider the size of or the number of persons served by the water company, the level of assessment necessary to insure immediate and continued compliance with such provision, and the character and degree of injury or impairment to or interference with or threat thereof to: (1) The purity of drinking water supplies; (2) the adequacy of drinking water supplies; and (3) the public health, safety or welfare. The commissioner shall publish annually, or as the commissioner deems necessary in response to any guidelines or ruling promulgated by the United States Environmental Protection Agency, a schedule of the amounts, or ranges of amounts, of civil penalties that may be imposed under this section on the Department of Public Health's Internet web site if the civil penalty for a violation under this section has not been established by statute. Notwithstanding the provisions of chapter 54, the commissioner shall not be required to adopt or revise any regulations regarding the imposition of civil penalties when publishing such schedule. Not less than six months prior to publishing such schedule, the commissioner shall publish notice in the Connecticut Law Journal of his or her intention to publish such schedule on the department's Internet web site. Such notice shall include such schedule and the date on which the commissioner intends to hold a public hearing on such schedule and indicate that public comment on such schedule shall be provided to the commissioner not later than thirty days after the date of publication of such notice. The commissioner shall hold the public hearing on such schedule not later than thirty days after the date of publishing such notice. The commissioner shall take any public comments received under this subsection into consideration in establishing such schedule. The commissioner shall publish a document responding to such comments on the department's Internet web site not less than one month prior to publishing such schedule.",
              "(b) In setting a civil penalty in a particular case, where the civil penalty has not been established by statute or pursuant to the schedule in subsection (a) of this section, the commissioner shall consider all factors which the commissioner deems relevant, including, but not limited to, the following: (1) The amount of assessment necessary to ensure immediate and continued compliance with such provision; (2) the character and degree of impact of the violation on the purity and adequacy of drinking water supplies; (3) whether the water company incurring the civil penalty is taking all feasible steps or procedures necessary or appropriate to comply with such provisions or to correct the violation; (4) any prior violations by such water company of statutes, regulations, orders or permits administered, adopted or issued by the commissioner; (5) the character and degree of injury to, or interference with, public health, safety or welfare which has been or may be caused by such violation; and (6) whether the consumers of the water company have been notified of such violation pursuant to section 19-13-B102 of the regulations of Connecticut state agencies.",
              "(c) If the commissioner has reason to believe that a violation has occurred, the commissioner may impose a penalty if compliance is not achieved by a specified date and send to the suspected violator, by certified mail, return receipt requested, or personal service at the address filed with the department by the water company as required under subsection (a) of section 25-33 or, if the water company did not file an address as required under said subsection, to the last known address of the water company on file at the department, a notice which shall include: (1) A reference to the sections of the statute or regulation involved; (2) a short and plain statement of the violation; (3) a statement of the amount of the civil penalty or penalties imposed; (4) the initial date of the imposition of the penalty when the penalty is imposed for a continuing violation, or the date for which the penalty is imposed when the penalty is imposed for an isolated violation; and (5) a statement of the water company's right to a hearing. The commissioner shall send a copy of such notice to the local director of health in the municipality or municipalities in which such violation occurred or that utilize such water.",
              "(d) The civil penalty shall be payable for noncompliance on the date specified in subsection (c) of this section and for each day thereafter until the water company against which the penalty was issued demonstrates to the commissioner that the violation has been corrected.",
              "(e) The water company to which the notice is addressed shall have twenty days from the date of mailing of the notice to make written application to the commissioner for a hearing to contest the imposition of the penalty. The application shall include a detailed statement of all of the grounds for contesting the imposition of the penalty. The water company shall send a copy of such application to the local director of health in the municipality or municipalities in which such violation occurred or that utilize such water. All hearings under this section shall be conducted pursuant to sections 4-176e to 4-184 , inclusive, except that the presiding officer shall automatically grant each local director of health in the municipality or municipalities in which such violation occurred or that utilize such water the right to be heard in the proceeding. Any civil penalty may be mitigated by the commissioner upon such terms and conditions as the commissioner, in the commissioner's discretion, deems proper or necessary upon consideration of the factors set forth in subsection (b) of this section.",
              "(f) A final order of the commissioner assessing a civil penalty shall be subject to appeal as set forth in section 4-183 after a hearing before the commissioner pursuant to subsection (e) of this section, except that any such appeal shall be taken to the superior court for the judicial district of New Britain and shall have precedence in the order of trial as provided in section 52-191 . Such final order shall not be subject to appeal under any other provision of the general statutes. No challenge to any such final order shall be allowed as to any issue which could have been raised by an appeal of an earlier order, notice, permit, denial or other final decision by the commissioner. The local director of health in the municipality or municipalities in which such violation occurred or that utilize such water for which the order was assessed shall have the right to be heard on such appeal.",
              "(g) If any water company fails to pay any civil penalty, the Attorney General, upon request of the commissioner, may bring an action in the superior court for the judicial district of Hartford to obtain enforcement of the penalty by the court. All actions brought by the Attorney General pursuant to the provisions of this section shall have precedence in the order of trial as provided in section 52-191 .",
              "(h) The provisions of this section are in addition to and not in derogation of any other enforcement provisions of any statute administered by the commissioner. The powers, duties and remedies provided in such other statutes, and the existence of or exercise of any powers, duties or remedies under this section or under such other statute shall not prevent the commissioner from exercising any other powers, duties or remedies available to the commissioner at law or in equity."

A plan for any proposed new source of water supply submitted to the department pursuant to this subsection shall include documentation that provides for: (1) A brief description of potential effects that the proposed new source of water supply may have on nearby water supply systems including public and private wells; and (2) the water company's ownership or control of the proposed new source of water supply's sanitary radius and minimum setback requirements as specified in the regulations of Connecticut state agencies and that such ownership or control shall continue to be maintained as specified in such regulations. If the department determines, based upon documentation provided, that the water company does not own or control the proposed new source of water supply's sanitary radius or minimum setback requirements as specified in the regulations of Connecticut state agencies, the department shall require the water company proposing a new source of water supply to supply additional documentation to the department that adequately demonstrates the alternative methods that will be utilized to assure the proposed new source of water supply's long-term purity and adequacy. In reviewing any plan for a proposed new source of water supply, the department shall consider the issues specified in this subsection. The Commissioner of Public Health may adopt regulations, in accordance with the provisions of chapter 54, to carry out the provisions of this subsection and subsection (c) of this section. For purposes of this subsection and subsection (c) of this section, “distribution water main installations” means installations, extensions, replacements or repairs of public water supply system mains from which water is or will be delivered to one or more service connections and which do not require construction or expansion of pumping stations, storage facilities, treatment facilities or sources of supply. Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection, the department may approve any location of a replacement public well, if such replacement public well is (A) necessary for the water company to maintain and provide to its consumers a safe and adequate water supply, (B) located in an aquifer of adequate water quality determined by historical water quality data from the source of water supply it is replacing, and (C) in a more protected location when compared to the source of water supply it is replacing, as determined by the department. For purposes of this subsection, “replacement public well” means a public well that (i) replaces an existing public well, and (ii) does not meet the sanitary radius and minimum setback requirements as specified in the regulations of Connecticut state agencies.\n\n(c) Each water company shall report to the Department of Public Health, annually in an electronic format prescribed by the department, the number and location of all new distribution water main installations.\n\n(d) Each petition to the General Assembly for authority to develop or introduce any system of public water supply shall be accompanied by a copy of the recommendation and advice of said department thereon.\n\n(e) Each water company shall maintain (1) a list of the names and addresses of its customers, and (2) the results of water purity tests conducted under this chapter. Such list and results shall be retained for a period of three years and be available for inspection and copying by the Department of Public Health and municipal and district health departments, for the purpose of public health investigations.\n\nSee Sec. 2-20a re bills for the incorporation and franchise of water companies.\n\nSee Sec. 25-33k re permit to abandon water supply source."

A water company or other entity shall apply for such permit in the manner prescribed by the commissioner. Not later than thirty days before filing an application for such permit, the applicant shall notify the chief elected official of any municipality and any local health department or district in which such source of supply is located. Not later than sixty days after receipt of such notification, the municipality or municipalities and local health departments or districts receiving such notice, and any water company as defined in section 25-32a , may submit comments on such application to the commissioner. The commissioner shall take such comments into consideration when reviewing the application.",

The Commissioner of Public Health shall not be required to make a consultation pursuant to subparagraph (B) of this subdivision if the commissioner determines the source of water supply to be abandoned is a groundwater source with a safe yield of less than ten gallons per minute and is of poor water quality.",
              "(2) The Commissioner of Public Health shall grant a permit upon a finding that any groundwater source with a safe yield of less than 0.75 millions of gallons per day, any reservoir with a safe yield of less than 0.75 millions of gallons per day, any reservoir system with a safe yield of less than 0.75 millions of gallons per day, or any individual source within a reservoir system when such system has a safe yield of less than 0.75 millions of gallons per day will not be needed by such water company for present or future water supply and, in the case of a water company required to file a water supply plan under section 25-32d , that such abandonment is consistent with a water supply plan filed and approved pursuant to said section. No permit shall be granted if the commissioner determines that the source would be necessary for water supply by the company owning such source in an emergency or the proposed abandonment would impair the ability of such company to provide a pure, adequate and reliable water supply for present and projected future customers. As used in this section, a future source of water supply shall be considered to be any source of water supply necessary to serve areas reasonably expected to require service by the water company owning such source for a period of not more than fifty years after the date of the application for a permit under this section.",

            "text": "(a) For purposes of this section, “safe yield” means the maximum dependable quantity of water per unit of time that may flow or be pumped continuously from a source of supply during a critical dry period without consideration of available water limitations.\n\n(b) No source of water supply shall be abandoned by a water company or other entity without a permit from the Commissioner of Public Health. A water company or other entity shall apply for such permit in the manner prescribed by the commissioner. Not later than thirty days before filing an application for such permit, the applicant shall notify the chief elected official of any municipality and any local health department or district in which such source of supply is located. Not later than sixty days after receipt of such notification, the municipality or municipalities and local health departments or districts receiving such notice, and any water company as defined in section 25-32a , may submit comments on such application to the commissioner. The commissioner shall take such comments into consideration when reviewing the application.\n\n(c) (1) In determining whether to approve an application, the commissioner shall (A) consider the water supply needs of the water company, the state and any comments submitted pursuant to subsection (b) of this section, and (B) consult with the Commissioner of Energy and Environmental Protection, the Secretary of the Office of Policy and Management and the Public Utilities Regulatory Authority. The Commissioner of Public Health shall not be required to make a consultation pursuant to subparagraph (B) of this subdivision if the commissioner determines the source of water supply to be abandoned is a groundwater source with a safe yield of less than ten gallons per minute and is of poor water quality.\n\n(2) The Commissioner of Public Health shall grant a permit upon a finding that any groundwater source with a safe yield of less than 0.75 millions of gallons per day, any reservoir with a safe yield of less than 0.75 millions of gallons per day, any reservoir system with a safe yield of less than 0.75 millions of gallons per day, or any individual source within a reservoir system when such system has a safe yield of less than 0.75 millions of gallons per day will not be needed by such water company for present or future water supply and, in the case of a water company required to file a water supply plan under section 25-32d , that such abandonment is consistent with a water supply plan filed and approved pursuant to said section. No permit shall be granted if the commissioner determines that the source would be necessary for water supply by the company owning such source in an emergency or the proposed abandonment would impair the ability of such company to provide a pure, adequate and reliable water supply for present and projected future customers. As used in this section, a future source of water supply shall be considered to be any source of water supply necessary to serve areas reasonably expected to require service by the water company owning such source for a period of not more than fifty years after the date of the application for a permit under this section.\n\n(3) The Commissioner of Public Health shall grant a permit upon a finding that any groundwater source with a safe yield of more than 0.75 millions of gallons per day, any reservoir with a safe yield of more than 0.75 millions of gallons per day, any reservoir system with a safe yield of more than 0.75 millions of gallons per day, or any individual source within a reservoir system when such system has a safe yield of more than 0.75 millions of gallons per day is of a size or condition that makes it unsuitable for present or future use as a drinking water supply by the water company, other entity or the state. In making a decision, the commissioner shall consider the general utility of the source and the viability for use to meet water supply needs. The commissioner shall consider any public water supply plans filed and approved pursuant to sections 25-32d and 25-33h , and any other water system plan approved by the commissioner, and the efficient and effective development of public water supply in the state.

Following approval for exemption for a flood control project, the commissioner shall provide notice of the hazards of a flood greater than the capacity of the project design to each member of the legislature whose district will be affected by the project and to the following agencies and officials in the area to be protected by the project: The planning and zoning commission, the inland wetlands agency, the director of civil defense, the conservation commission, the fire department, the police department, the chief elected official and each member of the legislative body, and the regional council of governments. Notice shall be given to the general public by publication in a newspaper of general circulation in each municipality in the area in which the project is to be located.\n\n(3) If the activity or critical activity is a transportation capital project and (A) such project is not located at an airport, as defined in section 15-34 , (B) the federal government requires public participation regarding such activity or critical activity, (C) the state agency proposing to conduct or cause to be conducted such activity or critical activity sought public input on such activity or critical activity by implementing a plan approved by an agency of the federal government, and (D) such state agency submits to the commissioner a copy of the approved plan for public participation, a written summary of the opportunities for public participation that were provided and a copy or record of any comments received regarding such activity or critical activity and how such comments were responded to or addressed, the commissioner shall only be required to hold a public hearing on such application, upon receipt of a petition, signed by at least twenty-five persons, that alleges aggrievement or unreasonable pollution or destruction of the public trust.\n\n(4) For the purposes of subdivision (3) of this subsection, a petition alleges aggrievement or unreasonable pollution or destruction of the public trust if the petition sets forth specific facts that demonstrate that the legal rights, duties or privileges of at least one person who signed the petition will be, or may reasonably be expected to be, affected by such activity or critical activity, or that alleges that the activity or critical activity involves conduct which has, or which is reasonably likely to have, the effect of unreasonably polluting, impairing or destroying the public trust in the air, water or other natural resources of the state. Any such petition shall identify the relevant statutory or regulatory provision with which petitioners claim such activity or critical activity does not satisfy. The commissioner shall provide a copy of any such petition received to the state agency. Not more than seven business days after receipt of such petition, the state agency may object to such petition on the basis that the petition does not contain the specific factual demonstration required by this subdivision. The commissioner shall determine whether the petition satisfies the requirements of this subdivision and shall send notice of such determination, in writing, to the state agency and the person who submitted the petition.\n\n(5) Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to modify or limit any requirement of sections 22a-1a to 22a-1h , inclusive, concerning a public scoping process, a public hearing or public participation.\n\n(e) The use of a mill that is located on a brownfield, as defined in section 32-760 , shall be exempt from the certification requirements of subdivision (4) of subsection (b) of this section, provided the agency demonstrates: (1) The activity is subject to the environmental remediation requirements of the regulations adopted pursuant to section 22a-133k , (2) the activity is limited to the areas of the property where historical mill uses occurred, (3) any critical activity is above the five-hundred-year flood elevation, and (4) the activity complies with the provisions of the National Flood Insurance Program.\n\n(f) The failure of any agency to comply with the provisions of this section or any regulations adopted pursuant to section 25-68c shall be grounds for revocation of the approval of the certification.\n\n(g) The provisions of this section shall not apply to any proposal by the Department of Transportation, the Department of Housing or the Department of Economic and Community Development for a project within a drainage basin of less than one square mile.\n\n(h) The provisions of subsections (a) to (d), inclusive, and (f) and (g) of this section shall not apply to the following critical activities above the one-hundred-year flood elevation that involve state funded housing reconstruction, rehabilitation or renovation, provided the state agency that provides funding for such activity certifies that it complies with the provisions of the National Flood Insurance Program and the requirements of this subsection: (1) Projects involving the renovation or rehabilitation of existing housing on the Department of Housing's most recent affordable housing appeals list; (2) construction of minor structures to an existing building for the purpose of providing accessibility to persons with disabilities pursuant to the State Building Code; (3) construction of open decks attached to residential structures, properly anchored in accordance with the State Building Code; (4) the demolition and reconstruction of existing housing for persons and families of low and moderate income, provided there is no increase in the number of dwelling units and (A) such reconstruction is limited to the footprint of the existing foundation of the building or buildings used for such purpose, or which could be used for such purpose subsequent to reconstruction, or (B) such reconstruction is on a parcel of land where the elevation of such land is above the one-hundred-year flood elevation, provided there is no placement of fill within an adopted Federal Emergency Management Agency flood zone."

and\n\nWhereas, these acts provide for construction by the United States of dams for flood control and, where feasible, in addition to flood control for storage of water to be used for irrigation, recreation or hydroelectric power or for any of these purposes; and\n\nWhereas, the Connecticut is an interstate river and control of major floods on it can be obtained only by the construction of dams by the United States under authorization of the above mentioned acts; and\n\nWhereas, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and the States of Connecticut, New Hampshire and Vermont recognize that it is in the interest of their general welfare that the United States construct in the Connecticut River Valley a comprehensive system of local protection works and dams and reservoirs to control floods and prevent loss of life and property, the disruption of orderly processes and the impairment of commerce between the aforesaid states; and\n\nWhereas, the United States has constructed dikes, flood walls and other local protection works at Hartford and East Hartford in the State of Connecticut and at Springfield, Riverdale, West Springfield, Chicopee, Northampton, Holyoke, and Springdale, in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and dams and reservoirs for the storage of flood waters at Knightville, Birch Hill and Tully in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, at Surry Mountain in the State of New Hampshire and at Union Village in the State of Vermont and has reached agreements with the state wherein located for construction of dams and reservoirs for the storage of flood waters at Barre Falls in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and at Ball Mountain and at Townshend in the State of Vermont; and\n\nWhereas, the Congress has at various times authorized construction by the United States of other dams and reservoirs for the storage of flood waters in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and in the States of New Hampshire and Vermont and has more recently instructed the corps of engineers to determine what additional local protection works and dams and reservoirs are required for a comprehensive system to control floods in the Connecticut River and its tributaries; and\n\nWhereas, it is believed that such a comprehensive flood control system should include dams and reservoirs controlling flood runoff from approximately twenty-five per cent of the total drainage area of the Connecticut River above Hartford, Connecticut, and strategically located in reference to characteristics of tributaries and to damage centers; and\n\nWhereas, construction by the United States of additional dams and reservoirs in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and in the States of New Hampshire and Vermont, to complete such a comprehensive flood control system, will remove from the tax rolls of local governments of those states such property as is acquired by the United States and may work other hardships against the people of Massachusetts, New Hampshire and Vermont; and\n\nWhereas, it is highly desirable that any flood control dam and reservoir constructed by the United States in the Connecticut River Valley have the approval of the state wherein it is located and that states benefiting from construction of such dam and reservoir make reimbursement for such loss of taxes and for such hardships; and\n\nWhereas, a comprehensive system for the prevention of destructive floods and for water resources utilization in the Connecticut River Valley can best be accomplished by cooperation between the several states in the valley and by and through a common and joint agency of said several states;\n\nNow, therefore, the said Commonwealth of Massachusetts and States of Connecticut, New Hampshire and Vermont do hereby enter into the following compact, to-wit:\n\nARTICLE I\n\nThe principal purposes of this compact are: (a) To promote interstate comity among and between the signatory states; (b) to assure adequate storage capacity for impounding the waters of the Connecticut River and its tributaries for the protection of life and property from floods; (c) to provide a joint or common agency through which the signatory states, while promoting, protecting and preserving to each the local interest and sovereignty of the respective signatory states, may more effectively cooperate in accomplishing the object of flood control and water resources utilization in the basin of the Connecticut River and its tributaries.\n\nARTICLE II\n\nThere is hereby created “The Connecticut River Valley Flood Control Commission”, hereinafter referred to as the “commission”, which shall consist of twelve members, three of whom shall be residents of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts; three of whom shall be residents of the State of Connecticut; three of whom shall be residents of the State of New Hampshire; and three of whom shall be residents of the State of Vermont.\n\nThe members of the commission shall be chosen by their respective states in such manner and for such terms as may be fixed and determined from time to time by the law of each of said states respectively by which they are appointed. A member of the commission may be removed or suspended from office as provided by the law of the state for which he shall be appointed, and any vacancy occurring in the commission shall be filled in accordance with the laws of the state wherein such vacancy exists.\n\nA majority of the members from each state shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business, the exercise of any of its powers or the performance of any of its duties, but no action of the commission shall be binding unless at least two of the members from each state shall vote in favor thereof.\n\nThe compensation of members of the commission shall be fixed, determined, and paid by the state which they respectively represent. All necessary expenses incurred in the performance of their duties shall be paid from the funds of the commission.\n\nThe commission shall elect from its members a chairman, vice-chairman, clerk and treasurer. Such treasurer shall furnish to the commission, at its expense, a bond with corporate surety, to be approved by the commission, in such amount as the commission may determine, conditioned for the faithful performance of his duties.\n\nThe commission shall adopt suitable bylaws and shall make such rules and regulations as it may deem advisable not inconsistent with laws of the United States, of the signatory states or with any rules or regulations lawfully promulgated thereunder.\n\nThe commission shall make an annual report to the governor and legislature of each of the signatory states,

shall maintain a suitable office, where its maps, plans, documents, records and accounts shall be kept, subject to public inspection at such times and under such regulations as the commission shall determine.\n\nARTICLE III\n\nThe commission shall constitute a body, both corporate and politic, with full power and authority: (1) To sue and be sued; (2) to have a seal and alter the same at pleasure; (3) to appoint and employ such agents and employees as may be required in the proper performance of the duties hereby committed to it and to fix and determine their qualifications, duties and compensation; (4) to enter into such contracts and agreements and to do and perform any and all other acts, matters and things as may be necessary and essential to the full and complete performance of the powers and duties hereby committed to and imposed upon it and as may be incidental thereto; (5) to have such additional powers and duties as may hereafter be delegated to or imposed upon it from time to time by the action of the legislature of any of said states, concurred in by the legislatures of the other states and by the Congress of the United States.\n\nThe commission shall make, or cause to be made, such studies as it may deem necessary, in cooperation with the corps of engineers and other federal agencies, for the development of a comprehensive plan for flood control and for utilization of the water resources of the Connecticut River Valley.\n\nThe commission shall not pledge the credit of the signatory states or any of them.\n\nARTICLE IV\n\nThe signatory state wherein is located the site of each of the following dams and reservoirs agrees to the construction by the United States of each such dam and reservoir in accordance with authorization by the Congress:\n\nIn the Commonwealth of Massachusetts,\n\n(1) At Barre Falls on the Ware River controlling a drainage area of approximately fifty-seven (57) square miles and providing flood storage of

of Vermont fifty (50) per cent of the amount of taxes lost to their political subdivisions by reason of acquisition and ownership by the United States of lands, rights or other property therein for construction in the future of any flood control dam and reservoir specified in Article IV and also for any other flood control dam and reservoir hereafter constructed by the United States in the Connecticut River Valley.\n\nThe State of Connecticut agrees to reimburse the Commonwealth of Massachusetts forty (40) per cent, the State of New Hampshire forty (40) per cent and the State of Vermont forty (40) per cent of the amount of taxes lost to their political subdivisions by reason of acquisition and ownership by the United States of lands, rights or other property therein for construction in the future of any flood control dam and reservoir specified in Article IV and also for any other flood control dam and reservoir hereafter constructed by the United States in the Connecticut River Valley.\n\nAnnually, not later than November first of each year, the commission shall determine the loss of taxes resulting to political subdivisions of each signatory state by reason of acquisition and ownership therein by the United States of lands, rights or other property in connection with each flood control dam and reservoir for which provision for tax reimbursement has been made in the four paragraphs next above. Such losses of taxes as determined by the commission shall be based on the tax rate then current in each such political subdivision and on the average assessed valuation for a period of five years prior to the acquisition by the United States of such property, provided that whenever a political subdivision wherein a flood control dam and reservoir or portion thereof is located shall have made a general revaluation of property subject to the annual municipal taxes of such subdivision, the commission may use such revaluation for the purpose of determining the amount of taxes for which reimbursement shall be made.

The secretary shall coordinate a review of the revised documents by all other relevant state agencies and regional planning organizations, as defined in section 4-124i , and within ninety days of receiving such documents shall provide written comments thereon to the river commission and shall furnish a copy of such comments to the commissioner. After considering all comments received from the commissioner and the secretary, the river committee shall revise the river corridor protection plan as appropriate and shall publish in a newspaper having a substantial circulation in the affected area notice of the availability of the response to comments and the revised plan.\n\n(2) A river corridor protection plan shall set forth a strategy for achieving the protection and preservation objectives contained in the statement of objectives adopted pursuant to subsection (d) of this section and for reconciling existing incompatible uses with resource preservation. Such plan shall make recommendations for the modification of municipal plans of conservation and development and zoning, subdivision, site plan and wetlands regulations as necessary to allow implementation of the river corridor protection plan and to assure that each member municipality similarly preserves that portion of the river corridor under its jurisdiction. Such plan shall recommend that applicable municipal regulations be modified to prohibit mining, moving of earth and dredging, other than dredging to maintain existing uses, within the river corridor. Such plan may set out guidelines for disturbing vegetation within the river corridor and identify areas where clear-cutting should be prohibited; may recommend municipal adoption of programs to minimize pollution or development of the river corridor and maximize voluntary private preservation efforts; shall consider land and water uses which may be compatible with river protection, including hydropower, agriculture, recreation and waste discharges and may recommend appropriate revisions of any state or regional plans of development or municipal plans of conservation and development or open space plans. Such plan shall include a time schedule for state and municipal implementation of such regulatory modifications and programs.\n\n(3) A river corridor protection plan shall include the results of an instream flow study if the commissioner deems it necessary. An instream flow study shall be conducted in accordance with the commissioner's guidance and shall document water flow in the river corridor for the purpose of determining whether there is sufficient flow to allow withdrawals of water consistent with the resource protection and preservation objectives of the river corridor protection plan."

Such inventory shall also identify within such areas any locations providing public access to resources and any portions of the river or riverfront lands which have been degraded by human use and could be restored. The Commissioner of Agriculture shall prepare an inventory of agricultural land within such areas and shall submit such inventory for inclusion in the commission's inventory. In preparing the inventory a river commission shall utilize all relevant available information, including, but not limited to, the state rivers assessment database and wetland maps prepared pursuant to sections 22a-30 and 22a-42a .\n\n(b) After completing an inventory pursuant to subsection (a) of this section, a river commission shall prepare a written statement identifying in such areas those resources which should be preserved or enhanced, those existing uses which should be maintained, those degraded areas which should be restored and those areas in which potential industrial, commercial and other uses could be accommodated without degrading the resources of the river corridor. Such statement shall be known as the river commission's statement of objectives. In preparing a statement of objectives, the river commission shall consider the best uses of the river corridor as identified by the state rivers assessment database and potential conflicts among resources on the one hand and existing and potential uses of the river corridor on the other hand. The statement of objectives shall attempt to balance competing uses within the river corridor and its watershed lands and provide for multiple uses thereof.\n\n(c) After completing an inventory prepared pursuant to subsection (a) of this section and a statement of objectives prepared pursuant to subsection (b) of this section, the river commission shall prepare a map which shall be consistent with said inventory and statement of objectives and which defines the boundaries of the river corridor to be managed under the river corridor management plan prepared pursuant to subsection (h) of this section.\n\n(d) Upon completion of an inventory, statement of objectives and map pursuant to subsections (a), (b) and (c) of this section, the river commission shall publish in a newspaper having a substantial circulation in the affected area notice of a public hearing to be held not less than thirty days thereafter in one of the municipalities represented on the commission.

Such funds shall be held by the State Treasurer to be used and expended under the direction of the commissioner.\n\n(2) For the purpose of protecting or preserving river corridor resources, and subject to any lawful restrictions on acquisition of lands acquired with state funds, a municipality may acquire real property or any interest therein within a river corridor for which such commission has adopted a river corridor management plan. Such acquisition may be by purchase at fair market value, gift or devise. Such municipality may accept any gift or bequest of money or other personal property to be used to acquire such real property or interest therein, or to meet expenses involved in maintaining such real property.\n\n(g) (1) The commissioner shall coordinate the activities, including the granting of permits and other approvals, of all regulatory programs under his jurisdiction to assure that the administration of such programs is consistent with every approved river corridor management plan. Neither the commissioner nor the Connecticut Siting Council shall issue a permit or other approval for any activity which may affect a river corridor for which the commissioner has approved a river corridor management plan under section 25-235 unless the commissioner determines that such activity would not adversely affect any of the resources protected under such plan.\n\n(2) A member municipality may submit written testimony to the commissioner and may appear by right as a party to any hearing before the commissioner concerning any permit or other approval to be issued by the commissioner for an activity proposed within an approved river corridor, and may appeal any decision of the commissioner concerning such permit or other approval to the Superior Court in accordance with the provisions of section 4-183 ."
