If the landlord or qualified inspector finds bed bugs in the dwelling unit or in any contiguous unit of which the landlord is an owner, lessor or sublessor, such landlord or qualified inspector may have such additional access to the tenant's personal belongings as the landlord or qualified inspector determines is necessary and reasonable.

Any order granting a landlord access to a dwelling unit shall be served upon the tenant at least twenty-four hours before a landlord, qualified inspector or pest control agent enters the dwelling unit.",

A landlord who is required to change a tenant's locks or permit the tenant to change a tenant's locks under this subsection shall, not later than six hours after receipt of the request, inform the tenant whether the landlord will change the locks or permit the tenant to change the locks. If the landlord agrees to change the locks, the landlord shall do so not later than forty-eight hours after the date that the tenant makes such request.",

If a tenant changes the locks, the tenant shall ensure that the locks are changed in a workmanlike manner, utilizing locks of similar or improved quality as compared to the original locks. The landlord may replace a lock installed by or at the behest of a tenant if the locks installed were not of similar or improved quality or were not installed properly. If a tenant changes the locks to his or her dwelling unit under this subsection, the tenant shall provide a key to the new locks to the landlord not later than two business days after the date on which the locks were changed, except when good cause prevents the tenant from providing a key to the landlord within the prescribed time period.",

If a tenant changes the locks to his or her dwelling unit under this subsection, the tenant shall provide a key to the new locks to the landlord not later than two business days after the date on which the locks were changed, except when good cause prevents the tenant from providing a key to the landlord within the prescribed time period.\n\n(c) When a landlord changes the locks to a dwelling unit under subsection (a) or (b) of this section, the landlord (1) shall, if using a professional contractor or locksmith, be responsible for payment to such contractor or locksmith, (2) shall, at or prior to the time of changing such locks, provide a key to the new locks to the tenant, and (3) may charge a fee to the tenant not exceeding the actual reasonable cost of changing the locks. If the tenant fails to pay the fee, such cost may be recouped by suit against the tenant or as a deduction from the security deposit when the tenant vacates the dwelling unit, but shall not be the basis for a summary process action under chapter 832. For purposes of this subsection, “actual reasonable cost” means the cost of the lock mechanism, as well as the fee paid by the landlord for professional contractor or locksmith services.\n\n(d) A landlord may reprogram a digital or electronic lock with a new entry code to comply with the provisions of this section.\n\n(e) If a tenant residing in the dwelling unit is named as the respondent or defendant in an order described in subsection (a) of this section and under such order is required to stay away from the dwelling unit, the landlord shall not provide a key to such tenant for the new locks. Absent a court order permitting a tenant who is the respondent or defendant in such order to return to the dwelling unit to retrieve his or her possessions and personal effects, the landlord has no duty under the rental agreement or by law to allow such tenant access to the dwelling unit once the landlord has been provided with a court order requiring such tenant to stay away from the dwelling unit, and the landlord shall not permit such tenant to access the dwelling unit. Any tenant excluded from the dwelling unit under this section remains liable under the rental agreement with any other tenant of the dwelling unit for rent or damages to the dwelling unit.\n\n(f) A landlord may not require a tenant who is named as a protected person under an order described in subsection (a) of this section to pay additional rent or an additional deposit or fee because of the exclusion of the tenant who is named as the respondent or defendant in such order.\n\n(g) Any landlord or agent of such landlord who denies a tenant named as a respondent or defendant in an order described in subsection (a) of this section access to the dwelling unit pursuant to this section shall be immune from any civil liability arising from such denial, provided the landlord or agent complies with the provisions of this section and any applicable court order."

No tenant may institute an action under this section if a valid notice to quit possession or occupancy based upon nonpayment of rent has been served on such tenant prior to the institution of an action under this section or if a valid notice to quit possession or occupancy based on any other ground has been served on such tenant prior to such tenant making the complaint to the agency referred to in subsection (b) of this section, provided any such notice to quit is still effective.",
              "(b) The action shall be instituted by filing a complaint, under oath, with the clerk of the court. The complaint shall allege (1) the name of the tenant; (2) the name of the landlord; (3) the address of the premises; (4) the nature of the alleged violation of section 47a-7 or 47a-7a or subsection (a) of section 21-82 ; and (5) the dates when rent is due under the rental agreement and the amount due on such dates. The complaint shall also allege that at least twenty-one days prior to the date on which the complaint is filed, the tenant made a complaint concerning the premises to the municipal agency, in the municipality where the premises are located, responsible for enforcement of the housing code or, if no housing code exists, of the public health code, or to the agency responsible for enforcement of the code or ordinance alleged to have been violated, or to another municipal agency which referred such complaint to the municipal agency responsible for enforcement of such code or ordinance. In the case of a mobile manufactured home located in a mobile manufactured home park, such complaint may be made to the Commissioner of Consumer Protection. The entry fee shall be twenty-five dollars, which may be waived in accordance with section 52-259b . Such entry fee shall be a taxable cost of the action.

If the court orders a retroactive abatement of rent pursuant to subdivision (4) of this subsection and all or a portion of the tenant's rent was deposited with the court pursuant to subsection (h) of this section by a housing authority, municipality, state agency or similar entity, any rent ordered to be returned shall be returned to the tenant and such entity in proportion to the amount of rent each deposited with the court pursuant to subsection (h) of this section.",

If all or a portion of the tenant's rent is being paid to the landlord by a housing authority, municipality, state agency or similar entity, this requirement shall be satisfied if the tenant deposits an amount equal to such tenant's portion of the last agreed-upon rent with the clerk. The court may make such entity a party to the action. The clerk shall accept such payment of rent and shall provide the tenant with a receipt. Payment to the clerk shall, for all purposes, be the equivalent of having made payment to the landlord himself. No landlord may maintain an action against a tenant to recover possession for nonpayment of rent if an amount equal to the rent due has been received by the clerk. When the complaint and notice of the action are served pursuant to subsection (c) or (d) of this section, the clerk shall promptly notify the landlord of the receipt of any such payment and of the prohibition against maintaining an action to recover possession for nonpayment of rent.

If such breach can be remedied by repair by the tenant or payment of damages by the tenant to the landlord, and such breach is not so remedied within such fifteen-day period, the rental agreement shall terminate except that (1) if the breach is remediable by repairs or the payment of damages and the tenant adequately remedies the breach within such fifteen-day period, the rental agreement shall not terminate; or (2) if substantially the same act or omission for which notice was given recurs within six months, the landlord may terminate the rental agreement in accordance with the provisions of sections 47a-23 to 47a-23b , inclusive.

(1) Each landlord shall immediately deposit the entire amount of any security deposit received by such landlord from each tenant into one or more escrow accounts established or maintained in a financial institution for the benefit of each tenant.

(B) Whenever any real estate is transferred from a receiver to a successor, such receiver shall dispose of the escrow accounts as ordered by the court which appointed such receiver. The order of such court shall provide for the priority of the present and future rights of tenants to security deposits paid by them over the rights of any secured or unsecured creditor of any person and shall provide that the funds in such account shall be delivered to the successor of such receiver for immediate deposit in an escrow account for tenants who paid security deposits.\n\n(4) (A) The landlord shall provide each tenant with a written notice stating the amount held for the benefit of the tenant and the name and address of the financial institution at which the tenant's security deposit is being held not later than thirty days after the landlord receives a security deposit from the tenant or the tenant's previous landlord or transfers the security deposit to another financial institution or escrow account.\n\n(B) If the commissioner makes a written request to the landlord for any information related to a tenant's security deposit, including the name of each financial institution in which any escrow account is maintained and the account number of each escrow account, the landlord shall provide such information to the commissioner not later than seven days after the request is made.\n\n(i) Payment of interest on security deposits. On and after July 1, 1993, each landlord other than a landlord of a residential unit in any building owned or controlled by any educational institution and used by such institution for the purpose of housing students of such institution and their families, and each landlord or owner of a mobile manufactured home or of a mobile manufactured home space or lot or park, as such terms are defined in subdivisions (1), (2) and (3) of section 21-64 , shall pay interest on each security deposit received by such landlord at a rate of not less than the average rate paid, as of December 30, 1992, on savings deposits by insured commercial banks as published in the Federal Reserve Board Bulletin rounded to the nearest one-tenth of one percentage point, except in no event shall the rate be less than one and one-half per cent. On and after January 1, 1994, the rate for each calendar year shall be not less than the deposit index, determined under this section as it was in effect during such year. On and after January 1, 2012, the rate for each calendar year shall be not less than the deposit index, as defined in section 36a-26 , for that year. On the anniversary date of the tenancy and annually thereafter, such interest shall be paid to the tenant or resident or credited toward the next rental payment due from the tenant or resident, as the landlord or owner shall determine. If the tenancy is terminated before the anniversary date of such tenancy, or if the landlord or owner returns all or part of a security deposit prior to termination of the tenancy, the landlord or owner shall pay the accrued interest to the tenant or resident not later than twenty-one days after such termination or return. Interest shall not be paid to a tenant for any month in which the tenant has been delinquent for more than ten days in the payment of any monthly rent, unless the landlord imposes a late charge for such delinquency. No landlord shall increase the rent due from a tenant because of the requirement that the landlord pay on interest the security deposit.\n\n(j) Investigation of complaints by commissioner. Order. Jurisdiction. Regulations. (1) Except as provided in subdivision (2) of this subsection, the commissioner may receive and investigate complaints regarding any alleged violation of subsections (b), (d), (h) or (i) of this section. For the purposes of such investigation, any person who is or was a landlord shall be subject to the provisions of section 36a-17 . If the commissioner determines that any landlord has violated any provision of this section over which the commissioner has jurisdiction, the commissioner may, in accordance with section 36a-52 , order such person to cease and desist from such practices and to comply with the provisions of this section.\n\n(2) The commissioner shall not have jurisdiction over (A) the failure of a landlord to pay interest to a tenant annually under subsection (i) of this section, or (B) the refusal or other failure of the landlord to return all or part of the security deposit if such failure results from the landlord's good faith claim that such landlord has suffered damages as a result of a tenant's failure to comply with such tenant's obligations, regardless of whether the existence or amount of the alleged damages is disputed by the tenant. For purposes of this section, “good faith claim” means a claim for actual damages suffered by the landlord for which written notification of such damages has been provided to the tenant in accordance with the provisions of subdivision (2) of subsection (d) of this section.\n\n(3) The commissioner may adopt regulations, in accordance with chapter 54, to carry out the purposes of this section.\n\n(k) Penalties. (1) Any person who is a landlord at the time of termination of a tenancy and who knowingly and wilfully fails to pay all or any part of a security deposit when due shall be subject to a fine of not more than two hundred fifty dollars for each offense, provided it shall be an affirmative defense under this subdivision that such failure was caused by such landlord's good faith belief that he was entitled to deduct the value of damages he has suffered as a result of such tenant's failure to comply with such tenant's obligations.\n\n(2) Any person who knowingly and wilfully violates the provisions of subsection (h) of this section on or after October 1, 1979, shall be subject to a fine of not more than five hundred dollars or imprisonment of not more than thirty days or both for each offense. It shall be an affirmative defense under the provisions of this subdivision that at the time of the offense, such person leased residential real property to fewer than four tenants who paid a security deposit.\n\n(3) Any person who is a landlord at the time an interest payment is due under the provisions of subsection (i) of this section and who knowingly and wilfully violates the provisions of such subsection shall be subject to a fine of not more than one hundred dollars for each offense.\n\n(4) No financial institution shall be liable for any violation of this section except for any violation in its capacity as a landlord.\n\n(l) Rights not limited. Nothing in this section shall be construed as a limitation upon: (1) The power or authority of the state, the Attorney General or the commissioner to seek administrative, legal or equitable relief permitted by the general statutes or at common law; or (2) the right of any tenant to bring a civil action permitted by the general statutes or at common law."

Such form shall state in clear and simple language and in readable format (1) the amount to be paid, (2) the date by which such payment must be received by the clerk, and (3) the consequences of failure to make payment as ordered.\n\n(c) If the defendant files an objection to the motion, a hearing on the objection shall be held not more than seven days after such objection is filed, after which the court shall order the defendant to deposit with the court payments for use and occupancy in an amount equal to the fair rental value of the premises during the pendency of such action accruing from the date of such order. If all or a portion of the defendant's rent is being paid to the plaintiff by a housing authority, municipality, state agency or similar entity, this requirement shall be satisfied if the defendant deposits with the court an amount equal to his portion of the fair rental value of the premises. The last agreed-upon rent shall be prima facie evidence of the fair rental value of the premises. The party claiming a different amount shall have the burden of proving that the last agreed-upon rent is not the fair rental value. Such order shall permit the payment of such amounts in monthly installments, as such amounts become due. Nothing in this subsection shall preclude either party from subsequently moving to modify the amount of the payment order for cause shown.\n\n(d) If the defendant fails to make such payments as ordered, the clerk shall, immediately and without the filing of a motion, order the defendant to file his answer and, if the defendant fails to do so within four days of the mailing of such order, judgment shall forthwith be entered for the plaintiff. If the defendant files an answer within such four-day period, the clerk shall set such matter down for hearing not less than three nor more than seven days after such answer and reply, if any, are filed."

Upon the abolition of the office of assistant, consequent on the adoption of the constitution of 1818, the court consisted of a judge of the county court and a justice of the peace, and, after the abolition of county courts in 1855, the place of the judge was supplied by a county commissioner; such court was held to be one of limited jurisdiction. 18 C. 100. By the revision of 1875, the proceedings were to be before a single judge; actual violence, used or threatened, is necessary to constitute a forcible entry or detainer. 23 C. 515. If some of the defendants are not served with the process, the others cannot object. 4 C. 93. Necessary averments. 17 C. 212; 18 C. 95; 99 C. 127; 100 C. 577.

Section protects peaceable possession from disturbance, and the removal of plaintiff from the premises by police after plaintiff caused a disturbance and court's subsequent no contact order which effectively kept plaintiff off the premises did not form a proper basis for a finding of an entry and detainer. 121 CA 760. Section seeks to discourage owner resorting to self-help tactics so that peace and good order may be maintained. Id., 790. Defendant's act of entering premises without the consent of plaintiff pursuant to a reasonable, but mistaken, belief that plaintiff had vacated the premises did not violate the public policy that section seeks to uphold, and therefore did not constitute an unfair or deceptive trade practice under the Connecticut Unfair Trade Practices Act. 133 CA 321."

If the board or enforcing agency issues an order to a registrant, such order may be delivered in accordance with section 7-148ii , provided nothing in this section shall preclude a board or enforcing agency from providing notice in another manner permitted by applicable law.\n\n(b) If any order of the board of health or other enforcing agency is not complied with, or not so far complied with as the board or other enforcing agency regards as reasonable, within five days after the service thereof, or within such shorter time as the board or other enforcing agency designates, such order may be executed by the board or other enforcing agency, through its officers, agents, employees or contractors. The expense of executing such order, including an amount not to exceed five per cent of the expense thereof as a service charge and ten per cent of the expense thereof as a penalty shall be collected from the owner by an action in the name of the city, borough or town.\n\n(c) (1) Any expense of executing an order, including any service charge and penalty imposed by the board of health or other enforcing agency pursuant to the provisions of subsection (b) of this section, and remaining unpaid for a period of sixty days after its due date, shall constitute a lien upon the real estate against which the expense was imposed, provided a notice of violation is recorded in the land records and indexed in the name of the property owner not later than thirty days after the expense was imposed.\n\n(2) Each such notice of violation shall be effective from the time of the recording on the land records. Each lien shall take precedence over transfers and encumbrances recorded after such time.\n\n(3) Any municipal lien pursuant to the provisions of this section may be foreclosed in the same manner as a mortgage.\n\n(4) Any municipal lien pursuant to this section may be discharged or dissolved in the manner provided in sections 49-35a to 49-37 , inclusive.\n\n(d) Any board of health or other enforcing agency imposing an expense, including a service charge and penalty, pursuant to subsection (b) of this section, shall maintain a current record of all properties with respect to which such expenses remain unpaid in the office of such board or agency.
