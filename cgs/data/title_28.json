The authority of such local or joint organization for civil preparedness shall not supersede that of any regularly organized police or fire department. In order to be eligible for any state or federal benefits under this chapter, not later than January 1, 2017, and biennially thereafter, each town or city of the state shall have a current emergency plan of operations that has been approved by the commissioner. The plan shall be submitted to the commissioner after it has been approved by the local emergency management director and the local chief executive. Such plan may be submitted with a notice stating that the plan remains unchanged from the previously submitted version. The emergency plan of operations of every town or city situated on the shoreline of the state shall contain provisions addressing an emergency caused by any existing liquefied natural gas terminal located on the Long Island Sound and every town or city situated on the shoreline of the state shall submit such plan to the joint standing committee of the General Assembly having cognizance of matters relating to public safety and security, in accordance with the provisions of section 11-4a , and the commissioner to obtain approval. The committee shall hold a public hearing regarding such plan not later than thirty days after receiving the plan. Not later than five days after the hearing, the committee shall (1) hold a roll-call vote to approve or reject the plan, and (2) forward the plan and a record of the committee's vote to the General Assembly. Such emergency plan of operations shall not be approved by the commissioner unless the commissioner determines that the plan proposes strategies that address all the activities and measures of civil preparedness identified in subdivision (4) of section 28-1 , including, for any plan submitted on or after January 1, 2025, a domestic terrorism prevention strategy, as described in a domestic terrorism prevention plan annex, in accordance with any standards provided by the Division of Emergency Management and Homeland Security within the Department of Emergency Services and Public Protection. Each town or city of the state shall consider whether to include in such plan provisions for the nonmilitary evacuation of livestock, horses, pets and service animals, and the temporary sheltering of pets, service animals and animals trained to assist first responders.\n\n(b) Each local organization for civil preparedness shall consist of an advisory council and an emergency management director appointed by the chief executive officer. The advisory council shall contain representatives of city or town agencies concerned with civil preparedness and representatives of interests, including business, labor, agriculture, veterans, women's groups, local and state animal humane organizations and others, which are important to the civil preparedness program in the particular community. The emergency management director shall be responsible for the organization, administration and operation of such local organization, subject to the direction and control of the commissioner. The chief executive officer may remove any local emergency management director for cause.\n\n(c) Each local or joint organization shall perform such civil preparedness functions in the territorial limits within which it is organized as the commissioner prescribes. In addition, such local or joint organization shall conduct such functions outside such territorial limits as are prescribed by the state civil preparedness plan and program or by the terms of any mutual aid agreements to which the town is a party.\n\n(d) The emergency management director of each local or joint organization may, with the approval of the commissioner, collaborate with other public and private agencies within the state and develop or cause to be developed mutual aid agreements for civil preparedness aid and assistance in case of disaster too great to be dealt with unassisted. The emergency management director of such joint or local organization may, with the approval of the commissioner, enter into such mutual aid agreements with civil preparedness agencies or organizations in other states. Such agreements shall be consistent with the state civil preparedness plan and program and, in time of emergency, each local or joint organization shall render assistance in accordance with the provisions of such agreements to which it is a party unless otherwise ordered by the commissioner.\n\n(e) Each town or city shall have the power to make appropriations for the payment of salaries and expenses of its local or joint organization or any other civil preparedness agencies or instrumentalities.\n\n(f) In the event of a serious disaster or of a sudden emergency, when such action is deemed necessary for the protection of the health and safety of the people, and upon request of the local chief executive authority, the Governor or the commissioner, without regard to the provisions of section 22a-148 , may authorize the temporary use of such civil preparedness forces, including civil preparedness auxiliary police and firemen, as the Governor deems necessary. Personnel of such civil preparedness forces shall be so employed only with their consent. The provisions of section 28-14 shall apply to personnel so employed.\n\n(g) The state shall reimburse any town or city rendering aid under this section for the compensation paid and actual and necessary travel, subsistence and maintenance expenses of employees of such town or city while rendering such aid, and for all payments for death, disability or injury of such employees in the course of rendering such aid and for all losses of or damage to supplies or equipment of such town or city incurred in the course of rendering such aid.\n\n(h) Whenever, in the judgment of a local emergency management director, with prior approval of the commissioner, it is deemed essential to authorize the temporary assignment, with their consent, of any members of civil preparedness forces who are not paid employees of the state or any political subdivision thereof, for a temporary civil preparedness mission, the provisions of section 28-14 shall apply. A complete written record of the conditions and dates of such assignment shall be maintained by the local director concerned and such record shall be available for examination by the commissioner and the Attorney General. The commissioner shall establish the necessary procedures to administer this section."

As soon as possible after such proclamation, if the General Assembly is not then in session, the Governor shall meet with the president pro tempore of the Senate, the speaker of the House of Representatives, and the majority and minority leaders of both houses of the General Assembly and shall confer with them on the advisability of calling a special session of the General Assembly.\n\n(b) Upon such proclamation, the following provisions of this section and the provisions of section 28-11 shall immediately become effective and shall continue in effect until the Governor proclaims the end of the civil preparedness emergency:\n\n(1) Following the Governor's proclamation of a civil preparedness emergency pursuant to subsection (a) of this section or declaration of a public health emergency pursuant to section 19a-131a , the Governor may modify or suspend in whole or in part, by order as hereinafter provided, any statute, regulation or requirement or part thereof whenever the Governor finds such statute, regulation or requirement, or part thereof, is in conflict with the efficient and expeditious execution of civil preparedness functions or the protection of the public health. The Governor shall specify in such order the reason or reasons therefor and any statute, regulation or requirement or part thereof to be modified or suspended and the period, not exceeding six months unless sooner revoked, during which such order shall be enforced. Any such order shall have the full force and effect of law upon the filing of the full text of such order in the office of the Secretary of the State. The Secretary of the State shall, not later than four days after receipt of the order, cause such order to be printed and published in full in at least one issue of a newspaper published in each county and having general circulation therein, but failure to publish shall not impair the validity of such order. Any statute, regulation or requirement, or part thereof, inconsistent with such order shall be inoperative for the effective period of such order. Any such order shall be communicated by the Governor at the earliest date to both houses of the General Assembly.\n\n(2) The Governor may order into action all or any part of the department or local or joint organizations for civil preparedness mobile support units or any other civil preparedness forces.\n\n(3) The Governor shall order and enforce such blackouts and radio silences as are authorized by the United States Army or its duly designated agency and may take any other precautionary measures reasonably necessary in the light of the emergency.\n\n(4) The Governor may designate such vehicles and persons as shall be permitted to move and the routes which they shall follow.\n\n(5) The Governor shall take appropriate measures for protecting the health and safety of inmates of state institutions and children in schools.\n\n(6) The Governor may order the evacuation of all or part of the population of stricken or threatened areas and may take such steps as are necessary for the receipt and care of such evacuees.\n\n(7) The Governor may take such other steps as are reasonably necessary in the light of the emergency to protect the health, safety and welfare of the people of the state, to prevent or minimize loss or destruction of property and to minimize the effects of hostile action.\n\n(8) In order to insure the automatic and effective operation of civil preparedness in the event of enemy attack, sabotage or other hostile action, or in the event of the imminence thereof, the Governor may, at the Governor's discretion, at any time prior to actual development of such conditions, issue such proclamations and executive orders as the Governor deems necessary, such proclamations and orders to become effective only under such conditions.\n\nSee Sec. 28-8a re powers of chief executive officers of municipalities during major disasters or emergencies."

            "text": "(a) During the existence of a civil preparedness or public health emergency, as defined in section 19a-131 , the Governor may, in the event of shortage or disaster making such action necessary for the protection of the public, take possession (1) of any land or buildings, machinery or equipment; (2) of any horses, vehicles, motor vehicles, aircraft, ships, boats, rolling stock of steam, diesel or electric railroads or any other means of conveyance whatsoever; (3) of any antitoxins, pharmaceutical products, vaccines or other biological products; and (4) of any cattle, poultry or any provisions for persons or beast, and any fuel, gasoline or other means of propulsion necessary or convenient for the use of the military or naval forces of the state or of the United States, or for the better protection of the welfare of the state or its inhabitants according to the purposes of this chapter.\n\n(b) He may use and employ all property of which possession is taken, for such times and in such manner as he deems for the best interests of the state or its inhabitants, and may, in particular, when in his opinion the public exigency so requires, lease, sell or, when conditions warrant, distribute gratuitously to or among any or all of the persons within the state anything taken under this section.\n\n(c) If real estate is seized under this section, a declaration of the property seized, containing a full and complete description, shall within a reasonable time be filed with the Secretary of the State and with the town clerk of the town in which the property is located, and a copy of the declaration shall be furnished the owner. If personal property is seized under this section, the civil preparedness authorities by whom it is seized shall maintain a docket containing a permanent record of such personal property and its condition when seized, and shall furnish a true copy of the docket recording to the owner of the seized property.\n\n(d) The owner of any property taken under this section shall receive just compensation therefor as follows: (1) If property is taken for temporary use, the Governor shall, as soon as possible after the taking, fix the amount of compensation to be paid therefor. If such property is returned to the owner in a damaged condition or is not returned to the owner, the Governor shall fix forthwith the amount of compensation to be paid for such damages or failure to return. Whenever the Governor deems it advisable for the state to become the owner of property taken under this section, he shall forthwith cause the owner of the property to be notified in writing by registered or certified mail, postage prepaid, and shall file a copy of the notice with the Secretary of the State. (2) If the owner of property taken under this section refuses to accept the amount of compensation fixed in accordance with subdivision (1) of this subsection, he may prefer a petition to the superior court for the judicial district in which the property was taken or to a judge of said court if the court is not in session, praying that just compensation may be determined, which petition shall be accompanied by a summons signed by competent authority, to serve as process in civil actions before said court, notifying the Governor and all persons interested in such property to appear before the court or judge. The court or judge shall refer the determination of the amount of damages to a state referee as provided in section 48-10 . The state referee, after giving reasonable notice to the parties, shall, if possible, view the property in question, hear the evidence, ascertain the value, assess just damages to the owner or parties interested in the property taken and report his doings to the court or judge. The court or judge may accept the report or may reject it for irregular or improper conduct by the state referee in the course of his duties. If the report is rejected, the court or judge shall appoint another state referee, who shall proceed in the same manner as the first referee was required to proceed. If the report is accepted, such acceptance shall have the effect of a judgment in favor of the owner of the property against the state for the amount of the assessment made by the referee, and, except as otherwise provided by law, execution may issue therefor. The court or judge shall make any order necessary to protect the rights of all parties interested, but in no event shall the Governor be prevented from taking immediate possession and use of the property in question. The expenses and costs of such hearings shall be taxed against the petitioner except in cases where the assessment of damages made by the referee is larger than the amount fixed by the Governor under subdivision (1) of this subsection, in which case they shall be taxed against the state, audited and allowed by the Comptroller and paid by the state upon his order.\n\n(e) Whenever the Governor determines that any real property acquired and retained under the provisions of this chapter is no longer needed for the preparedness of the state or for purposes under this chapter, he shall so notify the original owner of such property and, upon the request of such owner and upon payment of the fair value thereof, the Governor shall return such property to such owner. If the Governor and the original owner do not agree as to the fair value of the property, such value shall be determined by three appraisers, one of whom shall be chosen by the Governor, one by the original owner and the third by the first two appraisers. The expenses of such determination shall be paid in equal shares by the state and the original owner.\n\n(f) Whenever the need for any personal property requisitioned under this chapter for the preparedness of the state terminates, the Governor may dispose of such property on such terms and conditions as he deems appropriate, but to the extent feasible and practicable he shall give the former owner of such property an opportunity to reacquire it (1) at its then fair value as determined by the Governor or (2) if it is to be disposed of at less than such value, otherwise than at a public sale of which such owner is given notice, at the highest price any other person is willing to pay therefor; provided the provisions of this subsection shall not apply in the case of fungibles or items having a fair value of less than one thousand dollars.\n\nSee Sec. 28-9 re Governor's powers during civil preparedness emergency."

              "This compact shall be known as the Intrastate Mutual Aid Compact and is made and entered into by and between the participating political subdivisions of this state. The purpose of this compact is to create a system of intrastate mutual aid between participating political subdivisions in the state. Each participant of this system recognizes that emergencies transcend political jurisdictional boundaries and that intergovernmental coordination is essential for the protection of lives and property and for best use of available assets. The system shall provide for mutual assistance among the participating political subdivisions in the prevention of, response to, and recovery from, any disaster that results in a declaration of a local civil preparedness emergency in a participating political subdivision, subject to that participating political subdivision's criteria for declaration. The system shall provide for mutual cooperation among the participating subdivisions in conducting disaster-related exercises, testing or training activities.",

              "(3) In the event of a serious disaster affecting any political subdivision of the state, the chief executive officer of that political subdivision may declare a local civil preparedness emergency. The chief executive officer of such political subdivision shall notify the Commissioner of Emergency Services and Public Protection of such declaration not later than twenty-four hours after such declaration. Such a declaration shall activate the emergency plan of operations of that political subdivision, as established under subsection (a) of section 28-7 , and authorize the request or furnishing of aid and assistance, including any aid and assistance provided under the intrastate mutual aid system described in this section. No immunity, rights or privileges shall be provided for any individual who self-dispatches in response to a declaration, without authorization by such individual's participating political subdivision.",

              "(2) The officers, members and employees of the responding political subdivision, including, but not limited to, public works personnel, firefighters, police or other assigned personnel rendering aid or assistance pursuant to the compact and this section shall have the same duties, rights, privileges and immunities as if they were performing their duties in the responding political subdivision.",

              "(2) A participating political subdivision may donate assets of any kind to a requesting participating political subdivision.

            "text": "Intrastate Mutual Aid Compact.\n\nArticle I. Purposes\n\nThis compact shall be known as the Intrastate Mutual Aid Compact and is made and entered into by and between the participating political subdivisions of this state. The purpose of this compact is to create a system of intrastate mutual aid between participating political subdivisions in the state. Each participant of this system recognizes that emergencies transcend political jurisdictional boundaries and that intergovernmental coordination is essential for the protection of lives and property and for best use of available assets. The system shall provide for mutual assistance among the participating political subdivisions in the prevention of, response to, and recovery from, any disaster that results in a declaration of a local civil preparedness emergency in a participating political subdivision, subject to that participating political subdivision's criteria for declaration. The system shall provide for mutual cooperation among the participating subdivisions in conducting disaster-related exercises, testing or training activities.\n\nArticle II. General Provisions\n\n(1) For purposes of this compact: (A) “Participating political subdivision” means each political subdivision of the state whose legislative body has not adopted a resolution withdrawing from this compact in accordance with the provisions of this article; and (B) “chief executive officer” means the elected or appointed officer granted the authority to declare a local civil preparedness emergency by the charter or ordinance of his or her political subdivision.\n\n(2) On and after October 1, 2007, each political subdivision within the state shall automatically be a participating member of this compact. A participating political subdivision may withdraw from this compact by adopting a resolution indicating its intent to do so. The political subdivision shall automatically be deemed to have withdrawn from this compact upon adoption of such a resolution. The chief executive officer of such political subdivision shall submit a copy of such resolution to the Commissioner of Emergency Services and Public Protection not later than ten days after the adoption of the resolution. Nothing in this article shall preclude a participating political subdivision from entering into a supplementary mutual aid agreement with another political subdivision or affect any other inter-local municipal agreement, including any other mutual aid agreement, to which a political subdivision may be a party or become a party.\n\n(3) In the event of a serious disaster affecting any political subdivision of the state, the chief executive officer of that political subdivision may declare a local civil preparedness emergency. The chief executive officer of such political subdivision shall notify the Commissioner of Emergency Services and Public Protection of such declaration not later than twenty-four hours after such declaration. Such a declaration shall activate the emergency plan of operations of that political subdivision, as established under subsection (a) of section 28-7 , and authorize the request or furnishing of aid and assistance, including any aid and assistance provided under the intrastate mutual aid system described in this section. No immunity, rights or privileges shall be provided for any individual who self-dispatches in response to a declaration, without authorization by such individual's participating political subdivision.\n\nArticle III. Responsibilities of the Local and Joint Organizations of Participating Political Subdivisions\n\nThe participating political subdivisions shall ensure that the duties of their local or joint organizations, as described in subsection (a) of section 28-7 , include the following:\n\n(1) Identifying potential hazards that could affect the participating political subdivisions using an identification system common to all participating jurisdictions;\n\n(2) Conducting of joint planning, intelligence sharing and threat assessment development with contiguous participating political subdivisions, and conducting joint training at least biennially;\n\n(3) Identifying and inventorying the current services, equipment, supplies, personnel and other resources related to planning, prevention, mitigation, response and recovery activities of the participating political subdivisions; and\n\n(4) Adopting and implementing the standardized incident management system approved by the Department of Emergency Services and Public Protection.\n\nArticle IV. Implementation\n\nAny request for assistance made by the chief executive officer of a participating political subdivision who has declared a local civil preparedness emergency shall be made to the chief executive officers of other participating political subdivisions or their designees. Requests may be oral or in writing, and shall be reported to the Commissioner of Emergency Services and Public Protection not later than twenty-four hours after the request. Oral requests shall be reduced to writing not later than forty-eight hours after the request.\n\nArticle V. Conditions\n\nA participating political subdivision's obligation to provide assistance in the case of a declared local civil preparedness emergency is subject to the following conditions:\n\n(1) A participating political subdivision shall have declared a local civil preparedness emergency;\n\n(2) A responding participating political subdivision may withhold or recall resources to the extent it deems necessary to provide reasonable protection and services for its own jurisdiction;\n\n(3) Personnel of a responding participating political subdivision shall continue under the command and control of their responding jurisdiction, including emergency medical treatment protocols, standard operating procedures and other protocols, but shall be under the operational control of the appropriate officials within the incident management system of the participating political subdivision receiving assistance; and\n\n(4) Assets and equipment of a responding participating political subdivision shall continue under the control of the responding jurisdiction, but shall be under the operational control of the appropriate officials within the incident management system of the participating political subdivision receiving assistance.\n\nArticle VI. Licenses, Certificates and Permits\n\n(1) If a person or entity holds a license, certificate or other permit issued by a participating political subdivision or the state evidencing qualification in a profession, mechanical skill or other skill, and the assistance of that person or entity is requested by a participating political subdivision, such person or entity shall be deemed to be licensed, certified or permitted in the political subdivision requesting assistance for the duration of the declared local civil preparedness emergency, subject to any limitations and conditions as may be prescribed by the chief executive officer of the participating political subdivisions, by executive order or otherwise; or by the person or entity's sponsor hospital.\n\n(2) The officers, members and employees of the responding political subdivision, including, but not limited to, public works personnel, firefighters, police or other assigned personnel rendering aid or assistance pursuant to the compact and this section shall have the same duties, rights, privileges and immunities as if they were performing their duties in the responding political subdivision.\n\nArticle VII. Reimbursement\n\n(1) Participating political subdivisions shall maintain documentation of all assets provided. In the event of federal reimbursement to a requesting political subdivision, any political subdivision providing assistance under the compact and this section shall receive its appropriate share of said reimbursement.\n\n(2) A participating political subdivision may donate assets of any kind to a requesting participating political subdivision. Unless requested in writing, no reimbursement shall be sought by a responding political subdivision from a requesting political subdivision that has declared a local civil preparedness emergency. Any written request for reimbursement must be made not later than thirty calendar days after the response, except that notice of intent to seek reimbursement shall be given at the time the aid is rendered, or as soon as possible thereafter.\n\n(3) Any dispute between political subdivisions regarding reimbursement shall be resolved by the parties not later than thirty days after written notice of the dispute by the party asserting noncompliance. If the dispute is not resolved within ninety days of the notice of the claim, either party may request that the dispute be resolved through arbitration. Any such arbitration shall be conducted under the commercial arbitration rules of the American Arbitration Association.\n\nArticle VIII. Liability\n\nFor the purposes of liability, all persons from a responding political subdivision under the operational control of the requesting political subdivision are deemed to be employees of the responding political subdivision. Neither the participating political subdivisions nor their employees, except in cases of wilful misconduct, gross negligence or bad faith, shall be liable for the death of or injury to persons or for damage to property when complying or attempting to comply with the intrastate mutual aid system."

Each state further recognizes that there will be emergencies which require immediate access and present procedures to apply outside resources to make a prompt and effective response to such an emergency. This is because few, if any, individual states have all the resources they may need in all types of emergencies or the capability of delivering resources to areas where emergencies exist.",
