The commissioner may, through the Attorney General, petition the superior court for the judicial district in which the violation occurred, or in which the person committing the violation resides or transacts business, for the enforcement of any order issued by the commissioner under this subdivision and for appropriate temporary relief or a restraining order. The commissioner shall certify and file in the court a transcript of the entire record of the hearing or hearings, including all testimony upon which such order was made and the findings and orders made by the commissioner.

Not later than twenty-one days after an embargo has been placed upon any article, unless the commissioner extends the embargo period based upon a reinspection which indicates the continuation of violation, the commissioner shall remove the embargo or bring a summary proceeding pursuant to chapter 54, or institute a civil action in the Superior Court, to embargo such article. No person shall alter, open, remove or dispose of such embargoed article by sale or otherwise without the permission of the commissioner or the commissioner's authorized agent, or, after a summary proceeding has been brought or a civil action has been instituted, without permission from the hearing officer or the court. If the embargo is removed by the commissioner, hearing officer or court, the commissioner, hearing officer and the state shall not be held liable for damages because of such embargo if the hearing officer or court finds that there was probable cause for the embargo.\n\n(b) Summary proceedings brought in accordance with this section shall be by complaint in the name of the commissioner against the person who has custody of the article to be embargoed.\n\n(c) The complaint shall contain: (1) A particular description of the article, (2) the name of the place where the article is located, (3) the name of the person in whose possession or custody the article was found, if such name is known to the person making the complaint or can be ascertained by reasonable effort, and (4) a statement as to the manner in which the article is adulterated or misbranded or the characteristics which render its distribution or sale illegal.\n\n(d) If, upon the hearing, it appears that the article was offered or exposed for sale, or had in possession with intent to distribute or sell, or was intended for distribution or sale, in violation of any provision of this chapter, the article may be confiscated by the Department of Consumer Protection or ordered by the hearing officer or court to be destroyed by the respondent or defendant in a manner prescribed by such hearing officer or court. No such article shall be sold contrary to any provision of this chapter. In the event of an adverse ruling against the respondent or defendant, the respondent or defendant shall be liable for all costs and expenses incurred by the department in investigating, containing, removing, monitoring, mitigating and disposing of the embargoed product as well as any legal expenses associated therewith. The proceeds of any sale, less the legal costs and charges, shall be paid into the State Treasury.\n\n(e) Whenever the commissioner or any of the commissioner's authorized agents finds, in any room, building, other structure or vehicle of transportation, any meat, seafood, poultry, vegetable, fruit or other perishable article which is unsound, or contains any filthy, decomposed or putrid substance, or that may be poisonous or deleterious to health or otherwise unsafe, the commissioner, or the commissioner's authorized agent, shall forthwith embargo or destroy the same, or in any other manner render the same unsalable as a human food.\n\n(f) Whenever the commissioner or any of the commissioner's authorized agents finds, in any room, building, other structure or vehicle of transportation, any drug or device, as defined in section 21a-92 , or drug paraphernalia, as defined in section 21a-240 , which is adulterated or insanitary, is produced, packed or held under insanitary conditions, is unsafe or not shown to be safe, may be contaminated by filth or may be deleterious or injurious to health, the commissioner, or the commissioner's authorized agent, shall forthwith embargo or destroy such drug, device or drug paraphernalia or in any other manner render such drug, device or drug paraphernalia unsalable.\n\n(g) The commissioner may, after notice and hearing, impose a civil penalty of not more than five thousand dollars for each separate offense on any person who removes any tag or other appropriate marking affixed to an article, or who offers or exposes an article for sale, which has been embargoed in accordance with the provisions of this section, without the permission of the commissioner or the commissioner's agent."

Such claim may be filed if the health club fails to make payment of such claim.",

If the commissioner discovers any such assets, the commissioner may request that the Attorney General take any action necessary for the realization thereof for the reimbursement of the guaranty fund.",

              "(k) When the commissioner has caused any sum to be paid from the guaranty fund to a buyer who has entered into a health club contract, the commissioner shall be subrogated to all of the rights of the buyer up to the amount paid, and the buyer shall assign all of the buyer's right, title, and interest in the claim up to such amount to the commissioner, and any amount and interest recovered by the commissioner on the claim shall be deposited to the guaranty fund, except as provided in subsection (c) of this section.",
              "(l) Notwithstanding any provision of the general statutes to the contrary, the commissioner may prohibit a health club from making payments to the Connecticut Health Club Guaranty Fund if, in the opinion of the commissioner, the health club within the past five years has engaged in any unfair or deceptive trade practices under subsection (a) of section 42-110b , has engaged in any conduct of a character likely to mislead, deceive or defraud the buyer, the public or the commissioner, or has violated any of the provisions this chapter. If the commissioner determines that a health club should be prohibited from making payments to the Connecticut Health Club Guaranty Fund, the department shall provide notice to the health club, which notice shall state the grounds for the contemplated action. Not later than fourteen days after the health club receives such notice, the health club may file a written request for a hearing. If a hearing is requested such hearing shall be conducted in accordance with the provisions of chapter 54.",
              "(m) Each health club which has been prohibited from making payments to the Connecticut Health Club Guaranty Fund shall furnish the commissioner with a guaranty bond satisfactory to the commissioner in a sum equal to one hundred twenty-five thousand dollars and shall obtain a certificate from the department that the requirements of this subsection have been met.

            "text": "(a) The Commissioner of Consumer Protection shall establish and maintain the Connecticut Health Club Guaranty Fund in accordance with the provisions of this section.\n\n(b) Any health club which receives a license pursuant to section 21a-223 shall pay a fee of five hundred dollars annually to the guaranty fund except that a health club operated primarily for the purpose of teaching particular forms of self-defense or martial arts that has annual gross revenues of less than one hundred thousand dollars shall pay one hundred dollars annually to the guaranty fund.\n\n(c) Payments received under subsection (b) of this section shall be credited to the guaranty fund whenever the fund balance is less than three hundred fifty thousand dollars. Money in the fund may be invested or reinvested in the same manner as funds of the state employees retirement system, and the interest derived from such investments shall be credited to the guaranty fund whenever the fund balance is less than three hundred fifty thousand dollars. Any such payments or interest not deposited in the guaranty fund shall be credited to the General Fund.\n\n(d) If a health club is no longer in operation at the location where the buyer entered into the contract, the buyer having a claim against said health club may apply to the commissioner for payment of such claim from the guaranty fund, if the claim arises from (1) failure to provide services, (2) failure to comply with its contract obligations, (3) failure to remain open for the duration of its contracts, or (4) failure to comply with any provision of this chapter. Such claim may be filed if the health club fails to make payment of such claim.\n\n(e) The commissioner shall provide forms for applications by buyers for payment from the guaranty fund. The application shall include the name and address of the health club, the beginning and ending date of the contract, the price of the contract, the date of the closing of the health club, the amount and the basis of the claim and a copy of the contract or other proof of membership deemed suitable by the commissioner. No application for a payment from the guaranty fund shall be accepted by the commissioner more than six months after the date of the closing of the location of the health club where the buyer entered into the contract.\n\n(f) (1) Before the commissioner may issue any order directing payment out of the guaranty fund to a buyer pursuant to this section, the commissioner shall first notify the health club of the buyer's application for an order directing payment out of the guaranty fund and of the health club's right to a hearing to contest the disbursement in the event that the health club (A) has already paid the buyer, or (B) is complying with a payment schedule in accordance with (i) a written agreement with the buyer, or (ii) a court judgment, order or decree.\n\n(2) If a health club described in subdivision (1) of this subsection requests a hearing, the commissioner shall grant such request and conduct the hearing in accordance with the provisions of chapter 54 if the health club submits such request (A) in writing, and (B) not later than fifteen days after the health club receives the notice issued by the commissioner pursuant to subdivision (1) of this subsection.\n\n(3) If the commissioner does not receive a request from a health club for a hearing within the fifteen-day period set forth in subdivision (2) of this subsection, the commissioner shall (A) determine that the buyer has not been paid, and (B) issue an order directing payment out of the guaranty fund for the amount due.\n\n(4) If multiple buyers submit claims against any health club, the commissioner may hear such buyers' applications in one proceeding.\n\n(g) After hearing, the commissioner shall issue an order requiring payment from the guaranty fund of any sum the commissioner finds to be payable upon such application. The total compensation payable from the guaranty fund on the closing of any one health club location shall not exceed seventy-five thousand dollars.\n\n(h) If the commissioner pays any amount as a result of a claim against a health club pursuant to an order under subsection (g) of this section, the health club shall not be eligible to receive a new or renewed license until the health club has repaid such amount in full, plus interest at a rate to be determined by the commissioner.\n\n(i) If the commissioner pays any amount as a result of a claim against a health club pursuant to an order under subsection (g) of this section, the commissioner shall determine if the health club is possessed of real or personal property or other assets, liable to be sold or applied in satisfaction of the claim on such fund. If the commissioner discovers any such assets, the commissioner may request that the Attorney General take any action necessary for the realization thereof for the reimbursement of the guaranty fund.\n\n(j) The commissioner may, in order to preserve the integrity of the guaranty fund, order payments to be made out of said fund for amounts less than the actual loss incurred by any buyer of a health club contract.\n\n(k) When the commissioner has caused any sum to be paid from the guaranty fund to a buyer who has entered into a health club contract, the commissioner shall be subrogated to all of the rights of the buyer up to the amount paid, and the buyer shall assign all of the buyer's right, title, and interest in the claim up to such amount to the commissioner, and any amount and interest recovered by the commissioner on the claim shall be deposited to the guaranty fund, except as provided in subsection (c) of this section.\n\n(l) Notwithstanding any provision of the general statutes to the contrary, the commissioner may prohibit a health club from making payments to the Connecticut Health Club Guaranty Fund if, in the opinion of the commissioner, the health club within the past five years has engaged in any unfair or deceptive trade practices under subsection (a) of section 42-110b , has engaged in any conduct of a character likely to mislead, deceive or defraud the buyer, the public or the commissioner, or has violated any of the provisions this chapter. If the commissioner determines that a health club should be prohibited from making payments to the Connecticut Health Club Guaranty Fund, the department shall provide notice to the health club, which notice shall state the grounds for the contemplated action. Not later than fourteen days after the health club receives such notice, the health club may file a written request for a hearing. If a hearing is requested such hearing shall be conducted in accordance with the provisions of chapter 54.\n\n(m) Each health club which has been prohibited from making payments to the Connecticut Health Club Guaranty Fund shall furnish the commissioner with a guaranty bond satisfactory to the commissioner in a sum equal to one hundred twenty-five thousand dollars and shall obtain a certificate from the department that the requirements of this subsection have been met. If a health club is no longer in operation at the location where the buyer entered into the contract, the buyer having a claim against the health club may apply to the commissioner for payment of such claim from the guaranty bond, if the claim arises from (1) failure to provide services, (2) failure to comply with its contract obligations, (3) failure to remain open for the duration of its contracts, or (4) failure to comply with any provision of this chapter. Such claim may be filed if, within thirty days after the buyer gives notice of the claim to the health club, the health club fails to make payment of such claim.\n\n(n) The commissioner may adopt regulations in accordance with chapter 54 to carry out the purposes of this section."

A practitioner who issues a prescription, but fails to electronically transmit the prescription, as permitted by this subsection, shall document the reason for the practitioner's failure to electronically transmit the prescription in the patient's medical record as soon as practicable, but in no instance more than seventy-two hours following the end of the temporary technological or electrical failure that prevented the electronic transmittal of the prescription. For purposes of this subdivision, “temporary technological or electrical failure” means failure of a computer system, application or device or the loss of electrical power to such system, application or device, or any other service interruption to such system, application or device that reasonably prevents the practitioner from utilizing his or her certified application to electronically transmit the prescription in accordance with subsection (b) of this section;",

The filling pharmacist shall promptly reduce such oral order to writing on a prescription blank, provided such oral order shall be confirmed by the proper completion and mailing or delivery of a prescription prepared by the prescribing registrant to the pharmacist filling such oral order within seventy-two hours after the oral order has been given. Such prescription of the registrant shall be affixed to the temporary prescription prepared by the pharmacist and both prescriptions shall be maintained on file as required in this chapter. The Department of Public Health and the Department of Consumer Protection, acting jointly, may adopt regulations, in accordance with chapter 54, allowing practitioners to prescribe, dispense or administer schedule II sympathomimetic amines as anorectics under certain specific circumstances.

No prescription or order for a controlled substance issued by a practitioner to an inanimate object or thing shall be considered a valid prescription within the meaning of this chapter.\n\n(b) Each prescribing practitioner, as defined in section 20-14c , who the Department of Consumer Protection authorizes to prescribe controlled substances, within the scope of practice of his or her license, shall electronically transmit the controlled substance prescription to a pharmacy. Electronically transmitted prescriptions shall be promptly printed out in hardcopy or created as an electronic record and filed by the prescriber. Electronically transmitted prescriptions shall be consistent with the requirements of the federal Controlled Substances Act, 21 USC 801, as amended from time to time. All records shall be kept on file for three years at the premises of the licensed practitioner and maintained in such form as to be readily available for inspection by the commissioner, his or her authorized agent or other persons, as authorized in section 21a-265 , at reasonable times. For purposes of this subsection and subsections (c), (d) and (e) of this section, the term “electronically transmit” means to transmit by computer modem or other similar electronic device.\n\n(c) A licensed practitioner shall not be required to electronically transmit a prescription when:\n\n(1) Electronic transmission is not available due to a temporary technological or electrical failure. In the event of a temporary technological or electrical failure, the practitioner shall, without undue delay, reasonably attempt to correct any cause for the failure that is within his or her control. A practitioner who issues a prescription, but fails to electronically transmit the prescription, as permitted by this subsection, shall document the reason for the practitioner's failure to electronically transmit the prescription in the patient's medical record as soon as practicable, but in no instance more than seventy-two hours following the end of the temporary technological or electrical failure that prevented the electronic transmittal of the prescription. For purposes of this subdivision, “temporary technological or electrical failure” means failure of a computer system, application or device or the loss of electrical power to such system, application or device, or any other service interruption to such system, application or device that reasonably prevents the practitioner from utilizing his or her certified application to electronically transmit the prescription in accordance with subsection (b) of this section;\n\n(2) The practitioner reasonably determines that it would be impractical for the patient to obtain substances prescribed by an electronically transmitted prescription in a timely manner and that such delay would adversely impact the patient's medical condition, provided if such prescription is for a controlled substance, the quantity of such controlled substance does not exceed a five-day supply for the patient, if the controlled substance was used in accordance with the directions for use. A practitioner who issues a prescription, but fails to electronically transmit the prescription, as permitted by this subsection, shall document the reason for the practitioner's failure to electronically transmit the prescription in the patient's medical record;\n\n(3) The prescription is to be dispensed by a pharmacy located outside this state. A practitioner who issues a prescription, but fails to electronically transmit the prescription, as permitted by this subsection, shall document the reason for the practitioner's failure to electronically transmit the prescription in the patient's medical record;\n\n(4) Use of an electronically transmitted prescription may negatively impact patient care, such as a prescription containing two or more products to be compounded by a pharmacist, a prescription for direct administration to a patient by parenteral, intravenous, intramuscular, subcutaneous or intraspinal infusion, a prescription that contains long or complicated directions, a prescription that requires certain elements to be included by the federal Food and Drug and Administration, or an oral prescription communicated to a pharmacist by a health care practitioner for a patient in a chronic and convalescent nursing home, licensed pursuant to chapter 368v; or\n\n(5) The practitioner demonstrates, in a form and manner prescribed by the commissioner, that such practitioner does not have the technological capacity to issue an electronically transmitted prescription. For the purposes of this subsection, “technological capacity” means possession of a computer system, hardware or device that can be used to electronically transmit controlled substance prescriptions consistent with the requirements of the federal Controlled Substances Act, 21 USC 801, as amended from time to time. The provisions of this subdivision shall not apply to a practitioner when such practitioner is prescribing as a telehealth provider, as defined in section 19a-906 , pursuant to subsection (c) of said section.\n\n(d) Any prescription issued in a form other than an electronically transmitted prescription pursuant to subsection (c) of this section may be issued as a written order or, to the extent permitted by the federal Controlled Substance Act, 21 USC 801, as from time to time amended, as an oral order or transmitted by facsimile machine. Such oral order or order transmitted by facsimile machine shall be promptly reduced to writing on a prescription blank or a hardcopy printout or created as an electronic record and filed by the pharmacist filling it. No duplicate, carbon or photographic copies and no printed or rubber-stamped orders shall be considered valid prescriptions within the meaning of this chapter.\n\n(e) Prescriptions for schedule II substances shall be electronically transmitted by the prescribing practitioner at the time of issuance and previously signed orders for such schedule II substances shall not be considered valid prescriptions within the meaning of this chapter. No practitioner shall prescribe, dispense or administer schedule II sympathomimetic amines as anorectics, except as may be authorized by regulations adopted by the Departments of Public Health and Consumer Protection acting jointly. To the extent permitted by the federal Controlled Substances Act, 21 USC 801, as from time to time amended, in an emergency, the dispensing of schedule II substances may be made upon the oral order of a prescribing registrant known to or confirmed by the filling pharmacist. The filling pharmacist shall promptly reduce such oral order to writing on a prescription blank, provided such oral order shall be confirmed by the proper completion and mailing or delivery of a prescription prepared by the prescribing registrant to the pharmacist filling such oral order within seventy-two hours after the oral order has been given. Such prescription of the registrant shall be affixed to the temporary prescription prepared by the pharmacist and both prescriptions shall be maintained on file as required in this chapter. The Department of Public Health and the Department of Consumer Protection, acting jointly, may adopt regulations, in accordance with chapter 54, allowing practitioners to prescribe, dispense or administer schedule II sympathomimetic amines as anorectics under certain specific circumstances. Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to require a licensed pharmacist to determine the diagnosis of a patient prior to dispensing a prescription for such substances to a patient.\n\n(f) All prescriptions for controlled substances shall comply fully with any additional requirements of the federal food and drug laws, the federal Controlled Substances Act, and state laws and regulations adopted under this chapter.\n\n(g) Repealed by P.A. 82-419, S. 46, 47.\n\n(h) Except when dispensed directly by a practitioner, other than a pharmacy, to an ultimate user, a controlled substance included in schedule III or IV, which is a prescription drug as determined under federal food and drug laws, shall not be dispensed without a written, electronically transmitted or oral prescription of a practitioner. The prescription shall not be filled or refilled more than six months after the date thereof or be refilled more than five times, unless renewed by the practitioner.\n\n(i) A controlled substance included in schedule V shall not be distributed or dispensed other than for a medical purpose.\n\n(j) A pharmacy may sell and dispense controlled substances upon the prescription of a prescribing practitioner, as defined in section 20-571 .\n\n(k) Pharmacies shall file filled prescriptions for controlled substances separately from other prescriptions. All schedule II prescriptions shall be filed in a separate file or in an electronic file. All schedule III, IV and V prescriptions shall be filed in another separate file or in an electronic file, except as otherwise provided for in regulations adopted pursuant to section 21a-243 , 21a-244 or 21a-244a . All written controlled substance prescriptions shall, immediately upon filling, be filed chronologically and consecutively.\n\n(l) (1) Any pharmacy may transfer:\n\n(A) A prescription for a controlled substance included in schedule III, IV or V to any other pharmacy in accordance with the requirements set forth in the federal Controlled Substances Act 21 USC 801 et seq. and the regulations promulgated thereunder, as from time to time amended; and\n\n(B) An unfilled prescription for a controlled substance included in schedule II, III, IV or V that was electronically transmitted in accordance with the requirements set forth in the federal Controlled Substances Act 21 USC 801 et seq. and the regulations promulgated thereunder, as from time to time amended. The pharmacy may transfer the unfilled electronic prescription by telephone or other electronic transmission if:\n\n(i) Such transfer is consistent with the federal Controlled Substances Act 21 USC 801 et seq. and the regulations promulgated thereunder, as from time to time amended, and policies established by the federal Drug Enforcement Administration;\n\n(ii) The pharmacy that first receives such prescription:\n\n(I) Takes measures to prevent such prescription from being filled at any pharmacy other than the pharmacy to which the such pharmacy is transferring such prescription; and\n\n(II) Records the name, telephone number and address of the pharmacy to which such pharmacy is transferring such prescription, and the name and license number of the pharmacist who receives such transferred prescription; and\n\n(iii) The pharmacy that receives such transferred prescription records:\n\n(I) All of the information required under subsection (a) of this section;\n\n(II) That such prescription has been transferred;\n\n(III) The name of the pharmacy that first received such prescription;\n\n(IV) The date on which such prescription was issued;\n\n(V) The date on which such prescription was transferred; and\n\n(VI) Any refills issued for such prescription if such prescription is for a controlled substance included in schedule III, IV or V of the federal Controlled Substances Act 21 USC 801 et seq.\n\n(2) The pharmacy that first receives an electronically transmitted prescription described in subparagraph (B) of subdivision (1) of this subsection may send a facsimile containing the prescription information for such prescription if such pharmacy is transferring such prescription pursuant to said subparagraph by telephone.\n\n(m) A practitioner authorized to prescribe controlled substances shall not prescribe anabolic steroids for the sole purpose of enhancing a patient's athletic ability or performance.\n\n(n) Each pharmacy, as defined in section 20-571 , shall accept an electronically transmitted prescription for a controlled substance from a practitioner, as defined in section 21a-316 . All records shall be kept on file for three years at the premises of the pharmacy and maintained current and separate from other business records in such form as to be readily available at the pharmacy for inspection by the Commissioner of Consumer Protection, his or her authorized agent or other persons, as authorized in section 21a-265 , at reasonable times. Prescription records received from the practitioner electronically may be stored electronically, provided the files are maintained in the pharmacy computer system for not less than three years. If the electronically transmitted prescription is printed, it shall be filed as required in subsection (k) of this section.\n\nSee Sec. 17a-714a re legal protections for licensed health care professionals who prescribe opioid antagonists to drug users.\n\nSee Sec. 20-14a re use of generic drug names in prescriptions."

For purposes of this subdivision, “business day” means any day during which the pharmacy is open to the public.\n\n(C) Each veterinarian, licensed pursuant to chapter 384, who dispenses a controlled substance prescription shall report to the commissioner the information described in subparagraph (A) of this subdivision, at least weekly, by electronic means or, if the veterinarian does not maintain records electronically, in a format approved by the commissioner.\n\n(5) The commissioner may contract with a vendor for purposes of electronically collecting such controlled substance prescription information. The commissioner and any such vendor shall maintain the information in accordance with the provisions of chapter 400j.\n\n(6) The commissioner and any such vendor shall not disclose controlled substance prescription information reported pursuant to subdivisions (3) and (4) of this subsection, except as authorized pursuant to the provisions of sections 21a-240 to 21a-283 , inclusive. Any person who knowingly violates any provision of this subdivision or subdivision (5) of this subsection shall be guilty of a class D felony.\n\n(7) The commissioner shall provide, upon request, controlled substance prescription information obtained in accordance with subdivisions (3) and (4) of this subsection to the following: (A) The prescribing practitioner or such practitioner's authorized agent, who is treating or has treated a specific patient, provided the information is obtained for purposes related to the treatment of the patient, including the monitoring of controlled substances obtained by the patient; (B) the prescribing practitioner with whom a patient has made contact for the purpose of seeking medical treatment or such practitioner's authorized agent, provided the request is accompanied by a written consent, signed by the prospective patient, for the release of controlled substance prescription information; or (C) the pharmacist who is dispensing controlled substances for a patient, or such pharmacist's authorized pharmacy technician, provided the information is obtained for purposes related to the scope of the pharmacist's practice and management of the patient's drug therapy, including the monitoring of controlled substances obtained by the patient. The prescribing practitioner, such practitioner's authorized agent, the pharmacist or such pharmacist's authorized pharmacy technician shall submit a written and signed request to the commissioner for controlled substance prescription information. Such prescribing practitioner, pharmacist or pharmacist's authorized pharmacy technician shall not disclose any such request except as authorized pursuant to sections 20-570 to 20-630 , inclusive, or sections 21a-240 to 21a-283 , inclusive.\n\n(8) No person or employer shall prohibit, discourage or impede a prescribing practitioner, pharmacist or pharmacist's authorized pharmacy technician from requesting controlled substance prescription information pursuant to this subsection.\n\n(9) Prior to prescribing greater than a seventy-two-hour supply of any controlled substance to any patient, the prescribing practitioner or such practitioner's authorized agent shall review the patient's records in the electronic prescription drug monitoring program established pursuant to this subsection. Whenever a prescribing practitioner prescribes a controlled substance, other than a schedule V nonnarcotic controlled substance, for the continuous or prolonged treatment of any patient, such prescriber, or such prescriber's authorized agent, shall review, not less than once every ninety days, the patient's records in such prescription drug monitoring program. Whenever a prescribing practitioner prescribes a schedule V nonnarcotic controlled substance, for the continuous or prolonged treatment of any patient, such prescribing practitioner, or such prescribing practitioner's authorized agent, shall review, not less than annually, the patient's records in such prescription drug monitoring program. If such electronic prescription drug monitoring program is not operational, such prescribing practitioner may prescribe greater than a seventy-two-hour supply of a controlled substance to a patient during the time of such program's inoperability, provided such prescribing practitioner or such authorized agent reviews the records of such patient in such program not more than twenty-four hours after regaining access to such program.\n\n(10) (A) A prescribing practitioner may designate an authorized agent to review the electronic prescription drug monitoring program and patient controlled substance prescription information on behalf of the prescribing practitioner. The prescribing practitioner shall ensure that any authorized agent's access to such program and patient controlled substance prescription information is limited to the purposes described in this section and occurs in a manner that protects the confidentiality of information that is accessed through such program. The prescribing practitioner and any authorized agent shall be subject to the provisions of 45 CFR 164.308, as amended from time to time, concerning administrative safeguards for the protection of electronic protected health information. A prescribing practitioner may be subject to disciplinary action for acts of the authorized agent as provided in subsection (a) of section 21a-322 .\n\n(B) Notwithstanding the provisions of subparagraph (A) of this subdivision, a prescribing practitioner who is employed by or provides professional services to a hospital shall, prior to designating an authorized agent to review the electronic prescription drug monitoring program and patient controlled substance prescription information on behalf of the prescribing practitioner, (i) submit a request to designate one or more authorized agents for such purposes and a written protocol for oversight of the authorized agent or agents to the commissioner, in the form and manner prescribed by the commissioner, and (ii) receive the commissioner's approval to designate such authorized agent or agents and of such written protocol. Such written protocol shall designate either the hospital's medical director, a hospital department head, who is a prescribing practitioner, or another prescribing practitioner as the person responsible for ensuring that the authorized agent's or agents' access to such program and patient controlled substance prescription information is limited to the purposes described in this section and occurs in a manner that protects the confidentiality of information that is accessed through such program. A hospital medical director, a hospital department head, who is a prescribing practitioner, or another prescribing practitioner designated as the person responsible for overseeing an authorized agent's or agents' access to such program and information in the written protocol approved by the commissioner may be subject to disciplinary action for acts of the authorized agent or agents as provided in subsection (a) of section 21a-322 . The commissioner may inspect hospital records to determine compliance with written protocols approved in accordance with this section.\n\n(C) A pharmacist may designate a pharmacy technician to access the electronic prescription drug monitoring program and patient controlled substance prescription information on behalf of the pharmacist only for the purposes of facilitating the pharmacist's review of such patient information. The pharmacist shall ensure that any such pharmacy technician's access to such program and patient controlled substance prescription information is limited to the purposes described in this section and occurs in a manner that protects the confidentiality of information that is accessed through such program. The pharmacist and any authorized pharmacy technician shall be subject to the provisions of 45 CFR 164.308, as amended from time to time, concerning administrative safeguards for the protection of electronic protected health information. A pharmacist may be subject to disciplinary action for acts of the authorized pharmacy technician.\n\n(D) Prior to designating a pharmacy technician to access the electronic prescription drug monitoring program and patient controlled substance prescription information on behalf of the pharmacist, the supervising pharmacist shall provide training for the authorized pharmacy technicians. Such training shall designate a pharmacist as the person responsible for ensuring that the authorized pharmacy technician's access to such program and patient controlled substance prescription information is limited to the purposes described in this section and occurs in a manner that protects the confidentiality of information that is accessed through such program. A pharmacist designated as the person responsible for overseeing the pharmacy technician's access to such program may be subject to disciplinary action for acts of the authorized pharmacy technician. The commissioner may inspect records to document pharmacy technician training, that pharmacy technicians have access to the program and that patient controlled substance prescription information has been limited in accordance with the provisions of this section.\n\n(11) The commissioner shall adopt regulations, in accordance with chapter 54, concerning the reporting, evaluation, management and storage of electronic controlled substance prescription information.\n\n(12) The provisions of this section shall not apply to (A) samples of controlled substances dispensed by a physician to a patient, or (B) any controlled substances dispensed to hospital inpatients.\n\n(13) The provisions of this section shall not apply to any institutional pharmacy or pharmacist's drug room operated by a facility, licensed under section 19a-495 and regulations adopted pursuant to said section 19a-495 , that dispenses or administers directly to a patient an opioid agonist for treatment of a substance use disorder, unless the patient has signed a consent to disclose the patient's records to a prescription drug monitoring program that is compliant with 42 CFR 2 Subpart B. Each signed consent form shall be made available for review by the commissioner upon request. If consent is withdrawn by the patient, the institutional pharmacy or pharmacist's drug room operated by a facility shall immediately discontinue disclosing information about the specific patient who withdrew consent.\n\n(14) The commissioner may provide controlled substance prescription information obtained in accordance with subdivisions (3) and (4) of this subsection to other state agencies, pursuant to an agreement between the commissioner and the head of such agency, provided the information is obtained for a study of disease prevention and control related to opioid abuse or the study of morbidity and mortality caused by overdoses of controlled substances. The provision of such information shall be in accordance with all applicable state and federal confidentiality requirements.\n\n(15) Nothing in this section shall prohibit a prescribing practitioner or such prescribing practitioner's authorized agent from disclosing controlled substance prescription information submitted pursuant to subdivisions (3) and (4) of this subsection to the Department of Social Services for the purposes of administering any of said department's medical assistance programs.\n\n(16) Each pharmacy, nonresident pharmacy, as defined in section 20-627 , outpatient pharmacy in a hospital or institution, and dispenser shall report to the commissioner, at least daily, by electronic means or, if a pharmacy or outpatient pharmacy does not maintain records electronically, in a format approved by the commissioner information for all insulin drugs, glucagon drugs, diabetes devices and diabetic ketoacidosis devices prescribed and dispensed by such pharmacy or outpatient pharmacy, except such reporting requirement shall not apply to any veterinarian, licensed under chapter 384, who dispenses insulin drugs, glucagon drugs, diabetes devices and diabetic ketoacidosis devices for animal patients. Such pharmacy or outpatient pharmacy shall report such information to the commissioner in a manner that is consistent with the manner in which such pharmacy or outpatient pharmacy reports information for controlled substance prescriptions pursuant to subdivision (4) of this subsection. For the purposes of this subdivision, “insulin drug”, “glucagon drug”, “diabetes devices” and “diabetic ketoacidosis device” have the same meanings as provided in section 20-616 ."

Said commissioner shall keep a full and complete record of all substances received and of all substances disposed of, showing the exact kinds, quantities and forms of such substances, the persons from whom received and to whom delivered, by whose authority received, delivered and destroyed, and the dates of the receipt, disposal or destruction. Controlled substances and preparations shall at all times be properly safeguarded and securely kept. Minimum security and safeguard standards for the storage, manufacture, sale or distribution of all controlled substances shall be established by regulations adopted hereunder. Controlled substances seized or held as contraband or controlled substances, the title to which cannot be resolved, which controlled substances are not held by law enforcement agencies or court officials as evidence in criminal proceedings, shall be, upon the order of the court, destroyed by the seizing authority or delivered to the Commissioner of Consumer Protection as soon as possible upon resolution of the case or upon ascertaining the status of the unclaimed substance. The agent of the Commissioner of Consumer Protection shall issue a receipt for all such substance obtained. Any loss, destruction or theft of controlled substances shall be reported by a registrant within seventy-two hours to the Commissioner of Consumer Protection as follows: (1) Where, through breakage of the container or other accident, otherwise than in transit, controlled substances are lost or destroyed, the person having title thereto shall make a signed statement as to the kinds and quantities of controlled substances lost or destroyed and the circumstances involved, and immediately forward the statement to the Commissioner of Consumer Protection. A copy of such statement shall be retained by the registrant; (2) where controlled substances are lost by theft, or otherwise lost or destroyed in transit, the consignee shall, immediately upon ascertainment of the occurrence, file with the Commissioner of Consumer Protection a signed statement of the facts, including a list of the controlled substances stolen, lost or destroyed and documentary evidence that the local authorities were notified. A copy of the statement shall be retained by the registrant. As used in this section, “care-giving institution”, “correctional or juvenile training institution”, “institutional pharmacy” and “pharmacist” have the same meanings as provided in section 20-571 .\n\n(b) For each long-term care facility, two or more of the following persons may jointly dispose of excess stock of controlled substances: A nursing home administrator, a pharmacist consultant, a director of nursing services or an assistant director of nursing services. Such facility shall maintain documentation of any such destruction and disposal for a period of three years and such documentation shall be maintained in a separate log and on a form prescribed by the department.\n\n(c) For each outpatient surgical facility, as defined in section 19a-493b , two or more of the following persons may jointly dispose of excess stock of controlled substances: An administrator, a clinical director or chief of staff, or a nursing supervisor. Such facility shall maintain documentation of any such destruction and disposal for a period of three years and such documentation shall be maintained in a separate log and on a form prescribed by the department.\n\n(d) A registered nurse licensed by the Department of Public Health and employed by a home health care agency, as defined in section 19a-490 , may, with the permission of a designated representative of the patient, oversee the destruction and disposal of the patient's controlled substances, using the recommendations for the proper disposal of prescription drugs on the Internet web site of the Department of Consumer Protection. Such registered nurse shall maintain written or electronic documentation for a period of three years of any such destruction and disposal on a form prescribed by the Commissioner of Consumer Protection. Such written or electronic documentation shall be maintained with the patient's medical record. Nothing in this subsection shall prevent the registered nurse and patient's designated representative from depositing the patient's controlled substances in a statutorily authorized prescription drug drop box."

Defendant's conviction for sale of narcotic substance vacated where there was no evidence presented to support finding that the substance transferred was crack cocaine. 64 CA 596. There was sufficient evidence to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant knowingly entered into conspiracy to possess a narcotic substance with intent to sell; conviction of both possession of at least one-half gram of crack cocaine with intent to sell under Sec. 21a-278 and possession of powder cocaine with intent to sell under this section does not constitute double jeopardy. 75 CA 223. The quantity of drugs is not sole dispositive factor in determining whether defendant had intent to sell; intent is determined from the cumulative weight of circumstantial evidence and reasonable and logical inferences derived therefrom. 78 CA 659. Defendant was in constructive possession of cocaine when it was found in plain view on the floor of backseat of vehicle where defendant's feet had been when police officer first approached vehicle, and there was sufficient evidence of defendant's intent to sell narcotics where he had in his constructive possession 43 individually packaged bags of various forms of cocaine, he was arrested in an area known for drug activity, he did not have any drug paraphernalia on his person to indicate personal use of drugs, and cash in small denominations and a cellular telephone were present in the vehicle. 110 CA 778. There was insufficient evidence that it was defendant who had hidden narcotics and insufficient evidence to buttress an inference of dominion and control by defendant; evidence was insufficient to show that defendant had requisite intent to sell narcotics. 123 CA 690. Defendant's conviction of possession of a narcotic substance with intent to sell in violation of Subsec. must be merged with his conviction of possession of a narcotic substance with intent to sell by a person who is not drug-dependent in violation of Sec. 21a-278(b), and his sentence for possession of narcotics with intent to sell must be vacated. 126 CA 323; judgment reversed in part re merger of convictions, see 308 C. 242. Conviction of conspiracy to possess narcotics under Sec. 21a-279(a) and conspiracy to possess narcotics with intent to sell under Subsec. constitutes double jeopardy and court must vacate conviction for lesser included offense of conspiracy to possess narcotics. 137 CA 733; judgment reversed in part re requirement that court vacate conviction, see 316 C. 34."

Cited re admission of, and sufficiency of, evidence re conviction. 51 CA 824. Defendant's claim of drug dependency discussed and rejected. 62 CA 102. Trial court improperly failed to provide definition of “drug dependency” in accordance with the term's statutory definition or otherwise in its instructions to jury. 69 CA 505. Circumstantial evidence at trial provided adequate evidentiary basis for jury to find that substance at issue was LSD, which evidence included court's definition and description of LSD, defendant's statement re substance and manner of ingestion and effect of substance on person who ingested it. 85 CA 575. Defendant failed to demonstrate that his two convictions under section, resulting from searches on the same day, constituted double jeopardy because defendant was found with one stash of cocaine in his pocket, and a later search of his home found another stash of different purity, reflecting different purposes related to the cocaine; defendant did not demonstrate a due process violation regarding jury instruction on nonexclusive possession of premises where narcotics were found. 93 CA 548. Circumstantial evidence that defendant picked up package and was engaged in illicit activity was insufficient to support conviction of possession of marijuana and possession with the intent to sell marijuana when essential element of offense, knowledge of the character of the illegal substance, was lacking. 98 CA 458. Evidence sufficient to show defendant possessed requisite knowledge for conviction under statute. 110 CA 245. Defendant's conviction of possession of a narcotic substance with intent to sell in violation of Sec. 21a-277(a) must be merged with his conviction of possession of a narcotic substance with intent to sell by a person who is not drug-dependent in violation of Subsec., and his sentence for possession of narcotics with intent to sell must be vacated. 126 CA 323; judgment reversed in part re merger of convictions, see 308 C. 242. Proof that defendant knew package contained marijuana, and not a different substance, was an essential element of both the conspiracy count and accessory count; where defendant is charged as an accessory, state must prove defendant possessed 1 kilogram or more of marijuana, but need not prove that defendant knew he possessed 1 kilogram or more of marijuana. 151 CA 154."

Evidence that included large quantity of drugs found in defendant's vehicle, money strewn on passenger seat and fact that officers stopped defendant within 1,500 feet of a public housing project which is known for heavy drug trafficking was insufficient to establish defendant had requisite intent to sell drugs within 1,500 feet of the public housing project. 297 C. 621.

Section is not impermissibly vague because it provides adequate notice that the act of agreeing to distribute drugs while in the protected area, even though the drugs might be distributed outside the protected area, is enough for a conviction for either conspiring or attempting to distribute drugs under section. 124 CA 9. Evidence showing that defendant delivered crack cocaine to purchaser during ride in defendant's automobile, which traveled within and in excess of 1,500 feet of a school, was insufficient to fulfill state's burden of proof that the delivery of drugs occurred within the 1,500 foot zone. 127 CA 264; judgment reversed, see 308 C. 43. Definition of “public housing project” not void for vagueness. Id., 654. Mere speculation about the precise location or locations where defendant intended to sell marijuana is insufficient to support a conviction for possession of a controlled substance with intent to sell within 1,500 feet of a public school. 134 CA 232."

A laboratory of the United States Bureau of Narcotics is not required to be licensed under this section if it is approved by the Division of Scientific Services within the Department of Emergency Services and Public Protection.\n\n(b) The Division of Scientific Services within the Department of Emergency Services and Public Protection shall establish the standards for analytical tests to be conducted with respect to controlled drugs, or with respect to body fluids believed to contain alcohol, by qualified professional toxicologists and chemists operating under the division's direction and shall have the general responsibility for supervising such analytical personnel in the performance of such tests. The original report of an analysis made by such analytical personnel of the Division of Scientific Services or by a qualified toxicologist, pathologist or chemist of a laboratory of the United States Bureau of Narcotics shall be signed and dated, either by hand or electronically, by the analyst actually conducting the tests and shall state the nature of the analytical tests or procedures, the identification and number of samples tested and the results of the analytical tests. A copy of such report certified by the analyst shall be received in any court of this state as competent evidence of the matters and facts therein contained at any hearing in probable cause, pretrial hearing or trial. If such copy is to be offered in evidence at a trial, the attorney for the state shall send a copy thereof, by certified mail, to the attorney of the defendant who has filed an appearance of record or, if there is no such attorney, to the defendant if such defendant has filed an appearance pro se, and such attorney or defendant, as the case may be, shall, not later than five days after the receipt of such copy, notify the attorney for the state, in writing, if such attorney or defendant intends to contest the introduction of such certified copy. No such trial shall commence until the expiration of such five-day period and, if such intention to contest has been filed, the usual rules of evidence shall obtain at such trial.\n\n(c) In the case of any person charged with a violation of any provision of sections 21a-243 to 21a-279 , inclusive, who has been previously convicted of a violation of the laws of the United States or of any other state, territory or the District of Columbia, relating to controlled drugs, such previous conviction shall, for the purpose of sections 21a-277 and 21a-279 , be deemed a prior offense.\n\n(d) In addition to any fine, fee or cost that may be imposed pursuant to any provision of the general statutes, the court shall impose a cost of fifty dollars upon any person convicted of a violation of this chapter if an analysis of a controlled substance in relation to the conviction was performed by or at the direction of the chief toxicologist of the Department of Public Health or the Division of Scientific Services within the Department of Emergency Services and Public Protection. Any cost imposed under this subsection shall be credited to the appropriation for the Department of Emergency Services and Public Protection and shall not be diverted for any other purpose than the provision of funds for the Division of Scientific Services."

Fifty per cent of the maximum number of applications that shall be considered for each license type (1) shall be selected through a social equity lottery for such license type, and (2) shall be reserved by the department for social equity applicants. If, upon the close of the application period for a license type, the department receives more applications than the maximum number to be considered in total or to be reserved for social equity applicants as set forth in this subsection, a third-party lottery operator shall conduct a lottery to identify applications for review by the department and the Social Equity Council.",

              "(d) (1) Prior to submitting an application, an applicant that is a business entity shall register such business entity with the Secretary of the State to do business in this state, and include with such application an attestation that such applicant has so registered.",
              "(2) No applicant shall apply more than once in any application period to the social equity lottery round, if applicable, or the general lottery round. The department shall review the list of all lottery applicants in the social equity lottery round and the general lottery round, independently for each such round, to determine whether any applicant has submitted more than one application under the same applicant name. Except as provided in subdivision (3) of this subsection, if the department determines that any applicant has submitted more than one application in the social equity lottery round or the general lottery round, all applications submitted in such round by such applicant shall be disqualified and the department shall remove all such applications from the pool of eligible applications the department provides to the third-party lottery operator for selection in such round.",

              "(e) (1) Upon receipt of an application for social equity consideration or, in the case where a social equity lottery is conducted, after such lottery applicants are selected, the department shall provide to the Social Equity Council the documentation received by the department during the application process that is required under subsection (a) of this section. No identifying information beyond what is necessary to establish social equity status shall be provided to the Social Equity Council. The Social Equity Council shall review the social equity applications to be considered as identified by the third-party lottery operator to determine whether the applicant meets the criteria for a social equity applicant. If the Social Equity Council determines that an applicant does not qualify as a social equity applicant, the application shall not be reviewed further for purposes of receiving a license designated for social equity applicants. The application shall be entered into the general lottery for the applicable license type and may be reviewed further if selected through such lottery, provided the applicant pays the additional amount necessary to pay the full fee for entry into such lottery within five business days of being notified by the Social Equity Council that such applicant does not qualify as a social equity applicant. Not later than thirty days after the Social Equity Council notifies an applicant of the Social Equity Council's determination that the applicant does not meet the criteria for a social equity applicant, the applicant may appeal from such determination to the Superior Court in accordance with section 4-183 .",

This process may continue until the Social Equity Council has identified for further consideration the number of applications set forth on the department's web site pursuant to subsection (b) of this section or until there are no remaining social equity applications to be considered.",
              "(3) For each license type, the Social Equity Council shall identify for the department the social equity applications that qualify as social equity applicants and that should be reviewed by the department for purposes of awarding a provisional license.",

The number of applications to be reviewed by the department shall consist of the applications ranked numerically one through the maximum number necessary to ensure that fifty per cent of the applications for each license type identified through the lottery process are selected from the social equity lottery and approved by the Social Equity Council.",
              "(6) The numerical rankings created by the third-party lottery operator shall be confidential and shall not be subject to disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act, as defined in section 1-200 .",
              "(f) The department shall review each application to be considered, as identified by the third-party lottery operator or Social Equity Council, as applicable, to confirm such application is complete and to determine whether any application: (1) Includes a backer with a disqualifying conviction; (2) exceeds the cap set forth in section 21a-420i ; or (3) has a backer who individually or in connection with a cannabis business in another state or country has an administrative finding or judicial decision that may substantively compromise the integrity of the cannabis program, as determined by the department, or that precludes its participation in this state's cannabis program.",
              "(g) No additional backers may be added to a cannabis establishment application between the time of lottery entry, or any initial application for a license, and when a final license is awarded to the cannabis establishment, except, if a backer of an applicant or provisional licensee dies, the applicant or provisional licensee may apply to the commissioner to replace the deceased backer, provided if such applicant is a social equity applicant, the Social Equity Council shall review ownership to ensure such replacement would not cause the applicant to no longer qualify as a social equity applicant. A backer may be removed from a cannabis establishment application selected through the general lottery at any time upon notice to the department.",
              "(h) If an applicant is disqualified on the basis of any of the criteria set forth in subsection (f) of this section, the entire application shall be denied, and such denial shall be a final decision of the department unless the applicant removes from such application all backers that would cause such denial not later than thirty days after the department sends notice to the applicant disclosing such denial. Any change to a social equity applicant shall be reviewed and approved by the Social Equity Council before such change is reviewed by the department. Not later than thirty days after the department sends notice to the applicant disclosing such denial, the applicant may appeal such denial to the Superior Court.",
              "(i) For each application denied pursuant to subsection (f) of this section, the department may, within its discretion, request that the third-party lottery operator identify the next-ranked application in the applicable lottery. If the applicant that was denied was a social equity applicant, the next ranked social equity applicant shall first be reviewed by the Social Equity Council to confirm that the applicant qualifies as a social equity applicant prior to being further reviewed by the department. This process may continue until the department has identified for further consideration the number of applications equivalent to the maximum number set forth on its Internet web site pursuant to subsection (b) of this section. If the number of applications remaining is less than the maximum number posted on the department's Internet web site, the department shall award fewer licenses. To the extent the denials result in less than fifty per cent of applicants being social equity applicants, the department shall continue to review and issue provisional and final licenses for the remaining applications, but shall reopen the application period only for social equity applicants.",
              "(j) All applicants selected in the lottery and not denied shall be provided a provisional license application, which shall be submitted in a form and manner prescribed by the commissioner. Lottery applicants shall have sixty days from the date they receive their provisional application to complete the application. The right to apply for a provisional license is nontransferable. Upon receiving a provisional application from an applicant, the department shall review the application for completeness and to confirm that all information provided is acceptable and in compliance with this section and any regulations adopted under this section. If a provisional application does not meet the standards set forth in this section, the applicant shall not be provided a provisional license. A provisional license issued by the department to an applicant on or before June 30, 2023, other than a provisional license issued pursuant to section 21a-420o , shall expire twenty-four months after the date on which the department issued such provisional license and shall not be renewed. A provisional license issued by the department to an applicant on or after July 1, 2023, other than a provisional license issued pursuant to section 21a-420o , shall expire after fourteen months and shall not be renewed. Upon granting a provisional license, the department shall notify the applicant of the project labor agreement requirements of section 21a-421e . A provisional licensee may apply for a final license of the license type for which the licensee applied during the initial application period. A provisional license shall be nontransferable. If the provisional application does not meet the standards set forth in this section or is not completed within sixty days, the applicant shall not receive a provisional license. The decision of the department not to award a provisional license shall be final and may be appealed in accordance with section 4-183 . Nothing in this section shall prevent a provisional applicant from submitting an application for a future lottery.",
              "(k) Final license applications shall be submitted on a form and in a manner approved by the commissioner and shall include, but not be limited to, the information set forth in this section, as well as evidence of the following:",

              "(5) A certification by the applicant that a project labor agreement complying with section 21a-421e will be entered into by the cannabis establishment prior to construction of any facility to be used in the operation of a cannabis establishment;",
              "(6) A social equity plan approved by the Social Equity Council;",
              "(7) A workforce development plan approved by the Social Equity Council;",

              "(9) All other security requirements set forth by the department based on the specific license type.",
              "(l) At any point prior to the expiration of the provisional license, the department may award a provisional licensee a final license for the license type for which the licensee applied. Prior to receiving final license approval, a provisional licensee shall not possess, distribute, manufacture, sell or transfer cannabis. The department may conduct site inspections prior to issuing a final license.",
              "(m) At any time after receiving a final license, a cannabis establishment may begin operations, provided all other requirements for opening a business in compliance with the laws of this state are complete and all employees have been registered and all key employees and backers have been licensed, with the department."

If, upon the close of the application period for a license type, the department receives more applications than the maximum number to be considered in total or to be reserved for social equity applicants as set forth in this subsection, a third-party lottery operator shall conduct a lottery to identify applications for review by the department and the Social Equity Council.\n\n(c) (1) The third-party lottery operator shall:\n\n(A) Not be provided any application received after the close of the application period;\n\n(B) Give equal weight to every complete application submitted during the application period; and\n\n(C) Conduct multiple, separate geographic lotteries if required by the department.\n\n(2) For purposes of the lottery, the third-party lottery operator shall:\n\n(A) Conduct an independent social equity lottery and general lottery for each license type that results in each application being randomly ranked starting with one and continuing sequentially; and\n\n(B) Rank all applications in each lottery numerically according to the order in which they were drawn, including those that exceed the number to be considered, and identify for the department all applications to be considered.\n\n(d) (1) Prior to submitting an application, an applicant that is a business entity shall register such business entity with the Secretary of the State to do business in this state, and include with such application an attestation that such applicant has so registered.\n\n(2) No applicant shall apply more than once in any application period to the social equity lottery round, if applicable, or the general lottery round. The department shall review the list of all lottery applicants in the social equity lottery round and the general lottery round, independently for each such round, to determine whether any applicant has submitted more than one application under the same applicant name. Except as provided in subdivision (3) of this subsection, if the department determines that any applicant has submitted more than one application in the social equity lottery round or the general lottery round, all applications submitted in such round by such applicant shall be disqualified and the department shall remove all such applications from the pool of eligible applications the department provides to the third-party lottery operator for selection in such round.\n\n(3) If a social equity application is entered into the general lottery round pursuant to subdivision (4) of subsection (e) of this section, thereby resulting in two entries by the same social equity applicant in the general lottery round, such entries shall not result in disqualification under subdivision (2) of this subsection. Such social equity applicant shall not be eligible to receive more than one license from any round of the general lottery. If such social equity applicant is selected twice for consideration in any general lottery round, the department shall disqualify the second such selection and request that the third-party lottery operator identify the next-ranked application in the applicable lottery.\n\n(4) No disqualification under this subsection shall result in any refund of lottery fees.\n\n(5) For the purpose of this subsection: (A) “Application period” means the established period of time within which the department may accept applications for a specific license type for the social equity or general lottery; and (B) “round” means each time a lottery is run to determine the ranking of applicants after the conclusion of an application period, either for the social equity lottery or the general lottery.\n\n(e) (1) Upon receipt of an application for social equity consideration or, in the case where a social equity lottery is conducted, after such lottery applicants are selected, the department shall provide to the Social Equity Council the documentation received by the department during the application process that is required under subsection (a) of this section. No identifying information beyond what is necessary to establish social equity status shall be provided to the Social Equity Council. The Social Equity Council shall review the social equity applications to be considered as identified by the third-party lottery operator to determine whether the applicant meets the criteria for a social equity applicant. If the Social Equity Council determines that an applicant does not qualify as a social equity applicant, the application shall not be reviewed further for purposes of receiving a license designated for social equity applicants. The application shall be entered into the general lottery for the applicable license type and may be reviewed further if selected through such lottery, provided the applicant pays the additional amount necessary to pay the full fee for entry into such lottery within five business days of being notified by the Social Equity Council that such applicant does not qualify as a social equity applicant. Not later than thirty days after the Social Equity Council notifies an applicant of the Social Equity Council's determination that the applicant does not meet the criteria for a social equity applicant, the applicant may appeal from such determination to the Superior Court in accordance with section 4-183 .\n\n(2) Upon determination by the Social Equity Council that an application selected through the lottery process does not qualify for consideration as a social equity applicant, the department shall request that the third-party lottery operator identify the next-ranked application in the social equity lottery. This process may continue until the Social Equity Council has identified for further consideration the number of applications set forth on the department's web site pursuant to subsection (b) of this section or until there are no remaining social equity applications to be considered.\n\n(3) For each license type, the Social Equity Council shall identify for the department the social equity applications that qualify as social equity applicants and that should be reviewed by the department for purposes of awarding a provisional license.\n\n(4) Any application entered into, but not selected through, the social equity lottery shall not be reviewed as a social equity application, but shall be entered into the general lottery for the applicable license type.\n\n(5) After receiving the list of selected social equity applications reviewed and approved by the Social Equity Council, the department shall notify the third-party lottery operator, which shall then conduct the independent general lottery for all remaining applicants for each license type, rank all general lottery applications numerically including those that exceed the number to be considered, and identify for the department all of the selected applications to be reviewed. The number of applications to be reviewed by the department shall consist of the applications ranked numerically one through the maximum number necessary to ensure that fifty per cent of the applications for each license type identified through the lottery process are selected from the social equity lottery and approved by the Social Equity Council.\n\n(6) The numerical rankings created by the third-party lottery operator shall be confidential and shall not be subject to disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act, as defined in section 1-200 .\n\n(f) The department shall review each application to be considered, as identified by the third-party lottery operator or Social Equity Council, as applicable, to confirm such application is complete and to determine whether any application: (1) Includes a backer with a disqualifying conviction; (2) exceeds the cap set forth in section 21a-420i ; or (3) has a backer who individually or in connection with a cannabis business in another state or country has an administrative finding or judicial decision that may substantively compromise the integrity of the cannabis program, as determined by the department, or that precludes its participation in this state's cannabis program.\n\n(g) No additional backers may be added to a cannabis establishment application between the time of lottery entry, or any initial application for a license, and when a final license is awarded to the cannabis establishment, except, if a backer of an applicant or provisional licensee dies, the applicant or provisional licensee may apply to the commissioner to replace the deceased backer, provided if such applicant is a social equity applicant, the Social Equity Council shall review ownership to ensure such replacement would not cause the applicant to no longer qualify as a social equity applicant. A backer may be removed from a cannabis establishment application selected through the general lottery at any time upon notice to the department.\n\n(h) If an applicant is disqualified on the basis of any of the criteria set forth in subsection (f) of this section, the entire application shall be denied, and such denial shall be a final decision of the department unless the applicant removes from such application all backers that would cause such denial not later than thirty days after the department sends notice to the applicant disclosing such denial. Any change to a social equity applicant shall be reviewed and approved by the Social Equity Council before such change is reviewed by the department. Not later than thirty days after the department sends notice to the applicant disclosing such denial, the applicant may appeal such denial to the Superior Court.\n\n(i) For each application denied pursuant to subsection (f) of this section, the department may, within its discretion, request that the third-party lottery operator identify the next-ranked application in the applicable lottery. If the applicant that was denied was a social equity applicant, the next ranked social equity applicant shall first be reviewed by the Social Equity Council to confirm that the applicant qualifies as a social equity applicant prior to being further reviewed by the department. This process may continue until the department has identified for further consideration the number of applications equivalent to the maximum number set forth on its Internet web site pursuant to subsection (b) of this section. If the number of applications remaining is less than the maximum number posted on the department's Internet web site, the department shall award fewer licenses. To the extent the denials result in less than fifty per cent of applicants being social equity applicants, the department shall continue to review and issue provisional and final licenses for the remaining applications, but shall reopen the application period only for social equity applicants.\n\n(j) All applicants selected in the lottery and not denied shall be provided a provisional license application, which shall be submitted in a form and manner prescribed by the commissioner. Lottery applicants shall have sixty days from the date they receive their provisional application to complete the application. The right to apply for a provisional license is nontransferable. Upon receiving a provisional application from an applicant, the department shall review the application for completeness and to confirm that all information provided is acceptable and in compliance with this section and any regulations adopted under this section. If a provisional application does not meet the standards set forth in this section, the applicant shall not be provided a provisional license. A provisional license issued by the department to an applicant on or before June 30, 2023, other than a provisional license issued pursuant to section 21a-420o , shall expire twenty-four months after the date on which the department issued such provisional license and shall not be renewed. A provisional license issued by the department to an applicant on or after July 1, 2023, other than a provisional license issued pursuant to section 21a-420o , shall expire after fourteen months and shall not be renewed. Upon granting a provisional license, the department shall notify the applicant of the project labor agreement requirements of section 21a-421e . A provisional licensee may apply for a final license of the license type for which the licensee applied during the initial application period. A provisional license shall be nontransferable. If the provisional application does not meet the standards set forth in this section or is not completed within sixty days, the applicant shall not receive a provisional license. The decision of the department not to award a provisional license shall be final and may be appealed in accordance with section 4-183 . Nothing in this section shall prevent a provisional applicant from submitting an application for a future lottery.\n\n(k) Final license applications shall be submitted on a form and in a manner approved by the commissioner and shall include, but not be limited to, the information set forth in this section, as well as evidence of the following:\n\n(1) A contract with an entity providing an approved electronic tracking system as set forth in section 21a-421n ;\n\n(2) A right to occupy the location at which the cannabis establishment operation will be located;\n\n(3) Any necessary local zoning approval for the cannabis establishment operation;\n\n(4) A labor peace agreement complying with section 21a-421d has been entered into between the cannabis establishment and a bona fide labor organization, as defined in section 21a-421d ;\n\n(5) A certification by the applicant that a project labor agreement complying with section 21a-421e will be entered into by the cannabis establishment prior to construction of any facility to be used in the operation of a cannabis establishment;\n\n(6) A social equity plan approved by the Social Equity Council;\n\n(7) A workforce development plan approved by the Social Equity Council;\n\n(8) Written policies for preventing diversion and misuse of cannabis and sales to underage persons; and\n\n(9) All other security requirements set forth by the department based on the specific license type.\n\n(l) At any point prior to the expiration of the provisional license, the department may award a provisional licensee a final license for the license type for which the licensee applied. Prior to receiving final license approval, a provisional licensee shall not possess, distribute, manufacture, sell or transfer cannabis. The department may conduct site inspections prior to issuing a final license.\n\n(m) At any time after receiving a final license, a cannabis establishment may begin operations, provided all other requirements for opening a business in compliance with the laws of this state are complete and all employees have been registered and all key employees and backers have been licensed, with the department."

Nothing in this section prohibits an operator from requiring that a person applying for a position as a coach, instructor or athletic trainer submit to comprehensive background checks more than once during a five-year period.\n\n(g) If the comprehensive background check conducted pursuant to subsection (d) of this section results in a finding that a person who applied for a position as a coach, instructor or athletic trainer for a youth athletic activity has been convicted in this state or any other state of a felony as defined in section 53a-25 involving the use, attempted use or threatened use of physical force against another person, of cruelty to persons under section 53-20 , injury or risk of injury to or impairing morals of children under section 53-21 , abandonment of children under the age of six years under section 53-23 , or any felony where the victim of the felony is a child under eighteen years of age, or of a violation of section 53a-70b of the general statutes, revision of 1958, revised to January 1, 2019, or section 53a-70 , 53a-70a , 53a-71 , 53a-72a , 53a-72b or 53a-73a , or has a criminal record in this state or any other state that the operator reasonably believes may render the person unsuitable for a position as a coach, instructor or athletic trainer for a youth athletic activity, the operator to whom the person has applied shall not employ the person or accept the person as a volunteer if, after considering (1) the nature of the crime and its relationship to the position for which the person has applied; (2) information pertaining to the degree of rehabilitation of the convicted person; and (3) the time elapsed since the conviction or release, the operator determines that such person is not suitable for the position for which such person has applied."
