If, there are no known claimants, or possible claimants, to the property described in the complaint, the action shall be deemed to be maintained against all unknown persons claiming or who may claim any rights, title, estate, or interest, or lien or encumbrance upon the real or personal property described in the complaint, adverse to that of the plaintiff, whether the claim be vested or contingent, and the action may be prosecuted to judgment in the same manner and with like effect as though there had been known claimants or possible claimants designated as party defendants.",
              "(c) If the plaintiff or his attorney annexes to the complaint in any such action an affidavit setting forth such facts and in addition sets forth the efforts which were made to ascertain the names and addresses as well as the interest or estates of the unknown persons, the court to which the action is brought or a judge thereof may make such order relative to the notice which shall be given in such cause as the court or judge deems reasonable. That notice having been given according to the order and duly proven shall be sufficient to confer jurisdiction of all such unknown persons and the court may proceed to a hearing of the cause at any time that it deems proper. The court shall not be required to appoint any guardian or other person to represent such unknown persons under any legal disabilities and all such persons shall be concluded by any decree or judgment in respect to the real or personal property involved in the action.",
              "(d) Each defendant shall, in his answer, state whether or not he claims any estate or interest in, or encumbrance on, the property, or any part of it, and, if so, the nature and extent of the estate, interest or encumbrance which he claims, and he shall set out the manner in which the estate, interest or encumbrance is claimed to be derived.",
              "(e) No judgment for costs shall be rendered in such action against any defendant, who, by his answer, disclaims all estate or interest in or encumbrance on such property, but costs shall be taxed in his favor at the discretion of the court; and the court shall, in any such case, without further proof, render judgment that such defendant has no estate, interest in or encumbrance on such property or any part of it.",
              "(f) The court shall hear the several claims and determine the rights of the parties, whether derived from deeds, wills or other instruments or sources of title, and may determine the construction of the same, and render judgment determining the questions and disputes and quieting and settling the title to the property."

One to whom property is transferred pending action may be joined as party plaintiff. 123 C. 372. Attorney who prosecuted action involving real estate acquired no right of lien. Id., 374. Cited. 134 C. 427. Where defendant makes no claim until evidence is all in, that plaintiff failed sufficiently to set forth in his complaint the nature of his claim, title or interest, court will decline to entertain claim. Id., 663. Cited. 137 C. 646. In complaint, ownership or interest of plaintiff in land must be stated and plaintiff must prove that this title or interest is in actual controversy. 146 C. 288. Plaintiff's proof of an interest necessary to enable him to maintain an action under section is technically distinct from his proof of facts necessary to entitle him to an affirmative adjudication in his favor; party can obtain an adjudication of title or interest in himself only on the strength of his own title or interest as distinguished from the weakness of the title or interest of his adversaries; added claims for damages and appropriate equitable relief may be included in complaint. 147 C. 689. Cited. 149 C. 129. An exclusive possession maintained over a marked and readily visible area without the consent or license of the owner may result in the acquisition of title by adverse possession even though the adverse possessor may have believed he was not assuming a possession to which he was not entitled. 151 C. 357, 358. Trial court's judgment that defendant or its assignee was title owner set aside where assignee not made party to action; court failed to make positive and precise determination of where title lies which section requires. 155 C. 287. Plaintiffs, having failed to prove title in themselves by adverse possession, could not question title of defendant and there was no error in judgment of trial court finding issues for defendant. Id., 327. Recognition will be given to expressed intent of parties to deed in which there is ambiguity; to determine meaning of what parties said, testimony of parties was permitted where granting and habendum clauses were patently ambiguous; requirements for answer and judgment in actions to quiet title reviewed. 156 C. 12. Action may be brought under section by executor to determine validity of option to purchase her real estate given by decedent as section applies to personalty as well as realty. Id., 175. Right-of-way appurtenant cannot be created without dominant as well as servient estate; hence plaintiff has burden of proving her predecessor in title owned her land on date he reserved right-of-way in his deed to defendant's predecessor in title. Id., 387. Where executor seeks to institute action to quiet title to real property without alleging and proving that property is needed to settle claims against estate, requirements of section are not met, nor does his statutory power of “possession, care and control” over his decedents' realty alone amount to interest sufficient to satisfy requirements of section. 159 C. 371. Failure of defendant banks to plead the nature and extent of their interest in the property was not detrimental to any of the parties since the banks which took mortgages on the property admit the title of the mortgagor and therefore have an interest essentially identical to the other defendants. 175 C. 308. Title to portion of proposed street could be acquired by adverse possession since town had not expressly or implicitly accepted it for public use. 180 C. 274.

If the petitioner fails to provide such reasonable notice, the court may direct the petitioner to provide such reasonable notice and certify to the court that the petitioner has provided such reasonable notice.\n\n(c) In reviewing a petition filed under subsection (a) of this section, the court may only consider evidence as to whether the real estate listing provider recorded or rerecorded, or caused to be recorded or rerecorded, an unfair real estate listing agreement or a notice or memorandum thereof. The court may issue an order declaring such agreement, notice or memorandum to be void and unenforceable upon a showing that such agreement, notice or memorandum does not comply with the provisions of sections 47-36aaa to 47-36fff , inclusive. Such order shall include the volume and page number of the land records where such agreement, notice or memorandum is recorded or rerecorded, and shall direct the town clerk of the town in which the residential real property is located to discharge the recording or rerecording of such agreement, notice or memorandum as void and unenforceable.\n\n(d) If any unfair real estate listing agreement or notice or memorandum thereof is recorded or rerecorded, any person with an interest in the residential real property that is the subject of such agreement may recover such actual damages, costs and attorney's fees as may be proven against the real estate listing provider who recorded or rerecorded such agreement, notice or memorandum or caused such agreement, notice or memorandum to be recorded or rerecorded. Such actual damages, costs and attorney's fees shall be in lieu of any damages, costs and attorney's fees awarded in any action brought under chapter 735a for a violation of subsection (a) of section 47-36bbb ."

Use may originate in oral agreement or void deed; effect of claimant becoming executor of owner of fee. 90 C. 241. Where an individual use is in common with a public use, there must have been a use of the way by the individual distinctive from that of the general public. 134 C. 576. Trial court erred in denying plaintiff injunctive relief. 136 C. 277. No right can be acquired unless use defines its bounds with reasonable certainty. Id., 398. User by plaintiff's tenants inures to benefit of lessor; user by defendants not inconsistent with plaintiff's right. 137 C. 586. Where use is permissive, it cannot be under a claim of right. 139 C. 352. To acquire a right-of-way by prescription, there must be a user which is open, visible, continuous and uninterrupted for 15 years and made under a claim of right. 142 C. 296. Cited. Id., 708. Essential elements of a right-of-way by prescription are a use which is (1) open and visible, (2) continuous and uninterrupted for 15 years, (3) engaged in under a claim of right. 143 C. 40. Where defendant had maintained mooring stakes for over 30 years along river frontage of plaintiff's property and thereafter erected floating docks also along plaintiff's property, held defendant had not sustained burden of proving continuity of user to acquire by prescription enough of plaintiff's littoral rights to justify interference created by docks. 149 C. 560. Plaintiff acquired no prescriptive right where owner gave him permission of use; in absence of finding when use began, no prescriptive rights can be acquired. 151 C. 458. Riparian owner's rights to natural flow of water of stream through his land infringed by New London's expansion of its water reservoir in a drought held to entitle plaintiff to nominal damages and, unless city acquired water rights by eminent domain in a reasonable time, to an injunction of further diversion by the city. 157 C. 9.

Permanent injunction precluded plaintiff's asserting valid claim of right to use private way over defendant's property. 244 C. 583. In order to acquire a prescriptive easement, party may “tack on” the period of use or possession of someone who is in privity with the party, a relationship that may be established by showing a transfer of possession rights. 276 C. 782. Evidence was sufficient to establish that plaintiff's use of right-of-way was adverse, notorious and continuous and sufficient to gain legal right and title. 294 C. 418. Plaintiffs acquired prescriptive easement for recreational use of nonnavigable, artificial body of water through uninterrupted and continuous use for at least 15 years, and proof of daily or constant use was not necessary to acquire this type of easement. 296 C. 43."

Trial court finding that underground utility lines placed outside the deeded utility easement were open and visible where plaintiffs had knowledge of parameters of easement and sewer cleanouts were visible outside those parameters was not clearly erroneous. 92 CA 172. Trial court properly applied facts found to requirements of section in determining that necessary elements for establishing an easement by prescription had been met by a preponderance of the evidence and, in doing so, properly concluded plaintiff satisfied her burden of proof to establish use of driveway under a claim of right by offering testimony that neither she nor her predecessors asked for or were given permission to use defendant's driveway, but rather had used it under belief that it was their right to do so. 139 CA 813."

In the event the land records contain separate grantor indexes for persons and corporations, the name of such condominium shall be indexed in the grantee volume for corporations.\n\n(c) After any of the original condominium instruments has been modified or amended a total of five times, the board of directors shall prepare a restatement of such condominium instrument, incorporating all modifications and amendments to date, which instrument shall be recorded forthwith.\n\n(d) Simultaneously with the recording of the original declaration, if not previously filed, there shall be filed in the office of the town clerk of the municipality in which the condominium is located one or more surveys of the land submitted to the provisions of this chapter, showing (1) the boundary of the property and the immediate boundary of adjoining streets or highways to which the property has access; (2) the location and dimensions of any existing improvements; (3) the intended location and dimensions of any proposed improvements which are to be located within the condominium property; (4) to the extent feasible, the location and dimensions of all easements granted by or to the condominium; (5) any encroachments by or on any portion of the condominium property; (6) the distances between parcels constituting the condominium property, if any parcels are not contiguous; (7) to the extent then known, the location and dimensions of any parcels which may be added to the condominium property pursuant to section 47-70 , labeling each such parcel as an expansion parcel and, if there is more than one such parcel, identifying each parcel with an identifying letter or number, distinguishable from the letters or numbers used to identify individual units, and, where such expansion parcel is noncontiguous to the existing condominium property, the distance between each such expansion parcel and the existing condominium property. The specification within this subsection of matters to be shown on the survey shall not be construed to exclude other matters customarily shown or hereafter required for land title surveys.\n\n(e) There shall also be filed plans of every building which contains or constitutes all or any part of any unit or units, and which is located on any portion of the condominium parcel. Such plans shall show the approximate dimensions, floor area and location of each unit in each such building; the location and approximate dimensions of the limited common elements and common elements appertaining to each such building; and the elevation, or average elevation, in case of minor variances, above sea level, or from a fixed known point, of the upper and lower boundaries of each unit delineated on the plans. Such plans shall state the name of the condominium and shall bear a verified statement of a registered architect or licensed professional engineer certifying that the plans are an accurate copy of portions of the plans filed with the building official appointed pursuant to section 29-260 . Each unit shall be designated on the condominium plans by a letter or number, or a combination of them, or other appropriate designation. In the event the plans are modified, new plans shall be prepared and filed, containing all the identifications and references of the original plans, numbered identically to the original plans, filed therewith and designated “unit ownership–plans modified (indicate date).”\n\n(f) When adding additional land to an expandable condominium, the declarant shall file with the town clerk a new survey or surveys conforming to the requirements of subsection (d) of this section.\n\n(g) Each conveyance of any legal interest in a unit shall be recorded and indexed similarly to the conveyance of any interest in real property. No instrument conveying or purporting to convey such an interest shall be effectual against any other person but the grantor and his heirs unless recorded on the land records of the municipality in which the property lies.\n\n(h) If the condominium instruments create any restraint on free alienability of the condominium units including but not limited to a right of first refusal, the condominium association shall, during the month of January in each year, record on the land records of the municipality or municipalities where such condominium is located, a certificate setting forth the names of the president, secretary and treasurer of such association, their terms of office and the mailing address to which requests for approval of transfers or leases shall be sent.\n\n(i) Each condominium association shall, during the month of January in each year record on the land records of the municipality or municipalities where such condominium is located, a certificate setting forth the name and address of the insurance agency or agencies servicing the insurance policies required under section 47-83 and the expiration date of such policies. The information required by this subsection and by subsection (h) of this section may be included in a single certificate where appropriate."

Such percentage shall be computed on any of the following bases, or a combination thereof, provided that the declaration shall fully set forth the manner in which the percentage appertaining to each unit is ascertained: (A) The fair value of each unit at the date of the declaration in relation to the fair value of all the units having an interest in the common elements; (B) the size of each unit, as shown in the plans filed with the condominium instruments, in relation to the size of all of the units having any interest in the common elements; or (C) that the percentage appertaining to each unit, or to each unit within separate classifications, is to be identical. (2) The declaration may contain provisions relating to the appropriation, taking or condemnation by eminent domain by a federal, state or local government, or instrumentality thereof, including, but not limited to, reapportionment or other change of the common interest appurtenant to each unit or portion thereof remaining after a partial appropriation, taking or condemnation. The percentage of the undivided interest in the common elements shall not be separated from the unit to which it appertains and shall be deemed to be conveyed or encumbered with the unit even though such interest is not expressly mentioned or described in the conveyance or other instrument. (3) The common elements shall remain undivided and no unit owner or any other person shall bring any action for partition or division of any part thereof, unless the property has been removed from the provisions of this chapter and any covenant or provision in the condominium instruments or other document to the contrary shall be null and void, provided, that the unit owners may vote to sever all or part of the recreation facilities from the common elements and convey the same to a nonstock corporation pursuant to section 47-74c . (4) Each unit owner may use the common elements in accordance with the purpose for which they were intended, without hindering or encroaching upon the lawful rights of the other unit owners and, except as provided in the condominium instruments, the common elements shall be subject to mutual rights of support, access, use and enjoyment by all unit owners. Any portion of the common elements designated as limited common elements shall be used only by the owner or owners of the unit or units to which their use is limited in the condominium instruments, provided, that any unit owner of a unit to which the use of any limited common element is restricted may lease or license the use of the limited common element to any other unit owner, for an initial period of not more than one year. (5) The necessary work of maintenance, repair and replacement of the common elements and the making of any additions or improvements thereto shall be carried out only as provided herein and in the declaration and in the bylaws. (6) The declarant and the association of unit owners shall have the right, to be exercised by their duly authorized agents, to have access to each unit from time to time during reasonable hours as may be necessary for the maintenance, repair or replacement of any of the common elements therein or accessible therefrom, or for making emergency repairs therein necessary to prevent damage to the common elements or to another unit or units and the condominium instruments may contain such reasonable rules and regulations for the administration of this provision as the privacy and the protection of such units and their contents from burglary or larceny and from fire or other casualty may require.\n\n(c) The undivided interests in the common elements within any land added to the condominium pursuant to section 47-71a shall not be allocated until surveys and plans showing the same are recorded pursuant to said section 47-71a . Simultaneously with the recording of such survey and plans, the declarant shall execute and record an amendment to the declaration reallocating undivided interests in the common elements so that the units shown on such survey and plans shall be allocated undivided interests in the common elements on the same basis as the units shown on the survey and plans recorded simultaneously with the declaration pursuant to section 47-71 ."

              "(a) The General Assembly expressly finds that many leases involving the use of land or recreational or other common facilities by residents of a residential common interest community were entered into by parties wholly representative of the interests of a residential common interest developer at a time when the residential common interest community unit owners not only did not control the administration of their residential common interest community, but also had little or no voice in such administration. Such leases often contain numerous obligations on the part of either or both a residential common interest community association and residential common interest community unit owners with relatively few obligations on the part of the lessor. Such lease may or may not be unconscionable in any given case. Nevertheless, the General Assembly finds that a combination of certain onerous obligations and circumstances warrants the establishment of a rebuttable presumption of unconscionability of certain leases, as specified in subsection (d) of this section. The presumption may be rebutted by a lessor upon the showing of additional facts and circumstances to justify and validate what otherwise appears to be an unconscionable lease under this section. Failure of a lease to contain the required number of specified elements shall not preclude a determination of unconscionability of the lease. It is the intent of the General Assembly that this section is remedial and does not create any new cause of action to invalidate any residential common interest community lease, but shall operate as a statutory prescription on procedural matters in actions brought on one or more causes of action existing at the time of the execution of such lease.",
              "(b) The court, on finding as a matter of law that a contract or contract clause was unconscionable at the time the contract was made, may refuse to enforce the contract, enforce the remainder of the contract without the unconscionable clause or limit the application of any unconscionable clause in order to avoid an unconscionable result.",
              "(c) Whenever it is claimed, or appears to the court, that a contract or any contract clause is or may be unconscionable, the parties, in order to aid the court in making the determination, shall be afforded a reasonable opportunity to present evidence as to:",

            "text": "(a) The General Assembly expressly finds that many leases involving the use of land or recreational or other common facilities by residents of a residential common interest community were entered into by parties wholly representative of the interests of a residential common interest developer at a time when the residential common interest community unit owners not only did not control the administration of their residential common interest community, but also had little or no voice in such administration. Such leases often contain numerous obligations on the part of either or both a residential common interest community association and residential common interest community unit owners with relatively few obligations on the part of the lessor. Such lease may or may not be unconscionable in any given case. Nevertheless, the General Assembly finds that a combination of certain onerous obligations and circumstances warrants the establishment of a rebuttable presumption of unconscionability of certain leases, as specified in subsection (d) of this section. The presumption may be rebutted by a lessor upon the showing of additional facts and circumstances to justify and validate what otherwise appears to be an unconscionable lease under this section. Failure of a lease to contain the required number of specified elements shall not preclude a determination of unconscionability of the lease. It is the intent of the General Assembly that this section is remedial and does not create any new cause of action to invalidate any residential common interest community lease, but shall operate as a statutory prescription on procedural matters in actions brought on one or more causes of action existing at the time of the execution of such lease.\n\n(b) The court, on finding as a matter of law that a contract or contract clause was unconscionable at the time the contract was made, may refuse to enforce the contract, enforce the remainder of the contract without the unconscionable clause or limit the application of any unconscionable clause in order to avoid an unconscionable result.\n\n(c) Whenever it is claimed, or appears to the court, that a contract or any contract clause is or may be unconscionable, the parties, in order to aid the court in making the determination, shall be afforded a reasonable opportunity to present evidence as to:\n\n(1) The commercial setting of the negotiations;\n\n(2) Whether a party has knowingly taken advantage of the inability of the other party reasonably to protect his interests by reason of physical or mental infirmity, illiteracy, inability to understand the language of the agreement or similar factors;\n\n(3) The effect and purpose of the contract or clause; and\n\n(4) If a sale, any gross disparity, at the time of contracting, between the amount charged for the property and the value of that property measured by the price at which similar property was readily obtainable in similar transactions. A disparity between the contract price and the value of the property measured by the price at which similar property was readily obtainable in similar transactions does not, of itself, render the contract unconscionable.\n\n(d) A lease entered into prior to January 1, 1984, pertaining to use of land or facilities by unit owners in a residential common interest community, is presumed to be unconscionable if:\n\n(1) The lease by its terms requires the lessee to pay an annual rental and other expenses that exceed fifteen per cent of the appraised value of the leased property as improved, provided for the purposes of this subdivision, “annual rental and other expenses” means the amount paid by the lessee during the twelve months immediately preceding the filing of an action under this section as rent and for real estate taxes, insurance, capital improvements and other expenses required to maintain the property under the lease terms, and “appraised value” means the appraised value placed upon the leased property by a licensed or certified real estate appraiser on a date during the twelve months immediately preceding the filing of an action under this section; and\n\n(2) Seven of the following eight elements exist:\n\n(A) The lease was executed by persons none of whom at the time of the execution of the lease were elected by unit owners, other than the declarant;\n\n(B) The lease requires either the association or the unit owners to pay all real estate taxes on the subject real property;\n\n(C) The lease requires either the association or the unit owners to insure buildings or other facilities on the subject real property against fire or any other hazard;\n\n(D) The lease requires either the association or the unit owners to perform some or all maintenance obligations pertaining to the subject real property or facilities located upon the subject real property;\n\n(E) The lease requires either the association or the unit owners to pay rents to the lessor for a period of twenty-one years or more;\n\n(F) The lease provides that failure of the lessee to make payments of rents due under the lease creates, establishes or permits establishment of a lien upon individual units to secure claims for rent;\n\n(G) The lease provides for a periodic rental increase based upon reference to a price index; and\n\n(H) The lease or other common interest community documents require that any transferee of a unit must assume obligations under the lease.\n\n(e) The presumption set forth in subsection (d) of this section may be rebutted by a lessor upon the showing of additional facts and circumstances to justify and validate what otherwise appears to be an unconscionable lease under this section.\n\n(f) Failure of a lease to contain the required number of elements specified in subsection (d) of this section shall not preclude a determination that the lease is unconscionable.\n\n(g) Notwithstanding any provision of the general statutes, neither the statute of limitations nor laches shall prohibit unit owners of a residential common interest community from maintaining a cause of action under this section.\n\n(h) If a court finds that a lease contract or lease contract clause was unconscionable at the time the contract was made, in determining whether to enforce the contract, or enforce the remainder of the contract without the unconscionable clause, or whether to limit the application of any unconscionable clause in order to avoid an unconscionable result, the court shall consider evidence regarding the adverse impact, if any, of any such determination on the interests of third parties, including lenders who may have, in good faith, relied upon such lease provisions, and the court, in formulating such a determination, shall seek to avoid an unjust impact on such third parties and shall make no such determination, the effect of which would be to terminate the common interest community."

(1) re applicability of chapter to nonresidential communities by deleting the provision that a nonresidential community “is subject only to sections 47-204, 47-205 and 47-206 unless the declaration provides that this entire chapter is applicable” and adding Subparas.

(3), and revise renumbered Subdiv. (3) by restricting the exemption to a planned community “that is not subject to any development right”, increasing the maximum annual average common expense liability for the exemption to apply from $100 to $300 and adding Subparas.

An amendment, except an amendment pursuant to subsection (a) of section 47-231 , shall be indexed in the grantee's index in the name of the common interest community and the association and in the grantor's index in the name of the parties executing the amendment.\n\n(d) Except in the case of the exercise of development rights pursuant to section 47-229 or to the extent otherwise expressly permitted or required by other provisions of this chapter, with respect to a common interest community, whether created before, on or after January 1, 1984, no amendment may create or increase special declarant rights, increase the number of units or change the boundaries of any unit or the allocated interests of a unit, in the absence of unanimous consent of the unit owners.\n\n(e) Amendments to the declaration required by this chapter to be recorded by the association shall be prepared, executed, recorded and certified on behalf of the association by any officer of the association designated for that purpose or, in the absence of designation, by the president of the association.\n\n(f) An amendment to the declaration may prohibit or materially restrict the permitted uses or occupancy of a unit or the number or other qualifications of persons who may occupy units only by vote or agreement of unit owners of units to which at least eighty per cent of the votes in the association are allocated, unless the declaration specifies that a larger percentage of unit owners must vote or agree to that amendment or that such an amendment may be approved by the unit owners of units having at least eighty per cent of the votes of a specified group of units that would be affected by the amendment. An amendment approved under this subsection must provide reasonable protection for a use or occupancy permitted at the time the amendment was adopted.\n\n(g) The time limits specified in the declaration pursuant to subdivision (8) of subsection (a) of section 47-224 , within which reserved development rights and special declarant rights must be exercised may be extended, the number of units may be increased and new development rights or other special declarant rights may be created by amendment to the declaration if persons entitled to cast at least eighty per cent of the votes in the association, including eighty per cent of the votes allocated to units not owned by the declarant, agree to that action.

Notice of the proposed amendment to the declaration must be delivered in a record to all persons holding development rights or security interests in those rights. Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (c) of this section, the amendment to the declaration is effective thirty days after the amendment is recorded and notice is delivered unless any of the persons entitled to notice under this subsection records an objection in a record within the thirty-day period, in which case the amendment is void, or unless all of the persons entitled to notice under this subsection consent in a record at the time the amendment is recorded, in which case the amendment is effective when recorded.\n\n(h) Provisions in the declaration creating special declarant rights that have not expired may not be amended without the consent of the declarant.\n\n(i) If any provision of this chapter or of the declaration or bylaws of any common interest community created before, on or after January 1, 1984, requires the consent of a person holding a security interest in a unit as a condition to the effectiveness of any amendment to the declaration or bylaws, that consent shall be deemed granted if a refusal to consent in a record is not received by the association within forty-five days after the association delivers notice of the proposed amendment to the holder of the interest or mails the notice to the holder of the interest by certified mail, return receipt requested. The association may rely on the last-recorded security interest of record in delivering or mailing notice to the holder of that interest. Notwithstanding any provision of this section, an amendment to the declaration or bylaws that affects the priority of a holder's security interest, other than an amendment regarding the priority of the association's lien authorized by section 47-258 or the ability of that holder to foreclose its security interest may not be adopted without that holder's consent in a record if the declaration or bylaws require that consent as a condition to the effectiveness of the amendment.\n\n(j) If the declaration or bylaws of a common interest community, whether created before, on or after January 1, 1984, contains a provision requiring that amendments to the declaration or bylaws, other than amendments described in subsection (d) of this section, may be adopted only by the vote or agreement of unit owners of units to which more than eighty per cent of the votes in the association are allocated, such a proposed amendment shall be deemed approved if:\n\n(1) (A) Unit owners of units to which more than eighty per cent of the votes in the association are allocated vote for or agree to the proposed amendment;\n\n(B) No unit owner votes against the proposed amendment; and\n\n(C) Notice of the proposed amendment is delivered to the unit owners holding the votes in the association that have not voted or agreed to the proposed amendment and no objection in a record to the proposed amendment is received by the association within thirty days after the association delivers notice; or\n\n(2) Unit owners of units to which more than eighty per cent of the votes in the association are allocated vote for or agree to the proposed amendment but at least one unit owner objects to the proposed amendment and, pursuant to an action brought by the association in the Superior Court against all objecting unit owners, the court finds that the objecting unit owner or owners do not have a unique minority interest, different in kind from the interests of the other unit owners, that the voting requirement of the declaration was intended to protect.\n\n(k) (1) The executive board may, by a vote of a majority of the members of said board at a meeting held pursuant to section 47-250 , amend the declaration of a common interest community to remove from such declaration a provision that purports to restrict ownership or occupancy of units within the common interest community on the basis of race.\n\n(2) If a unit owner submits a written request to the executive board for an amendment to the declaration to remove a provision that purports to restrict ownership or occupancy of units within the common interest community on the basis of race, the board shall, not later than ninety days after receipt of such a request, hold a meeting to determine whether such a provision exists in the declaration and should be removed pursuant to the provisions of subdivision (1) of this subsection."

The declaration may specify a smaller percentage, but in no event less than a majority of the votes in the association, only if all of the units are restricted exclusively to nonresidential uses.",
              "(b) An agreement to terminate shall be evidenced by the execution of a termination agreement, or ratifications thereof, in the same manner as a deed, by the requisite number of unit owners. The termination agreement shall specify a date after which the agreement will be void unless it is recorded before that date. A termination agreement and all ratifications thereof shall be recorded in every town in which a portion of the common interest community is situated and is effective only on recordation.",

              "(d) In the case of a condominium or planned community containing any units not having horizontal boundaries described in the declaration, a termination agreement may provide for sale of the common elements, but it may not require that the units be sold following termination, unless the declaration as originally recorded provided otherwise or all unit owners consent to the sale.",

If any real property is to be sold following termination, title to that real property, on termination, vests in the association as trustee for the holders of all interests in the units. Thereafter, the association has all powers necessary and appropriate to effect the sale.

Proceeds of the sale shall be distributed to unit owners and lien holders, as their interests may appear, in accordance with subsections (h), (i) and (j) of this section. Unless otherwise specified in the termination agreement, as long as the association holds title to the real property, each unit owner and the unit owner's successors in interest have an exclusive right to occupancy of the portion of the real property that formerly constituted the unit. During the period of that occupancy, each unit owner and the unit owner's successors in interest remain liable for all assessments and other obligations imposed on unit owners by this chapter or the declaration.",

All other creditors of the association are to be treated as if they had perfected liens on the units immediately before termination.",

The decision of the independent appraisers shall be distributed to the unit owners and becomes final unless disapproved within thirty days after distribution by unit owners of units to which twenty-five per cent of the votes in the association are allocated. The proportion of any unit owner's interest to that of all unit owners is determined by dividing the fair market value of that unit owner's unit and its allocated interests by the total fair market values of all the units and their allocated interests.",
              "(2) If any unit or any limited common element is destroyed to the extent that an appraisal of the fair market value thereof before destruction cannot be made, the interests of all unit owners are their respective common expense liabilities immediately before the termination.",

Foreclosure or enforcement of a lien or encumbrance against withdrawable real property, or against common elements that have been subjected to a security interest by the association under section 47-254 , does not withdraw, of itself, that real property from the common interest community, but the person taking title thereto may require from the association, on request, an amendment excluding the real property from the common interest community.",

During the pendency of the action, the court may issue whatever orders it considers appropriate, including appointment of a receiver. After a hearing, the court may terminate the common interest community or reduce its size pursuant to this section, notwithstanding that eighty per cent of the unit owners did not vote or agree to that action, and may issue any other order the court considers to be in the best interest of the unit owners and persons holding a property interest in the common interest community."

Lack of privity does not deprive any unit owner of standing to maintain an action to enforce any obligation of the transferor.\n\n(2) If a successor to any special declarant right is an affiliate of a declarant, as defined in subsection (1) of section 47-202 , the transferor is jointly and severally liable with the successor for any obligations or liabilities of the successor relating to the common interest community.\n\n(3) If a transferor retains any special declarant rights, but transfers other special declarant rights to a successor who is not an affiliate of the declarant, the transferor is liable for any obligations or liabilities imposed on a declarant by this chapter or by the declaration relating to the retained special declarant rights and arising after the transfer.\n\n(4) A transferor has no liability for any act or omission or any breach of a contractual or warranty obligation arising from the exercise of a special declarant right by a successor declarant who is not an affiliate of the transferor.\n\n(c) (1) Unless otherwise provided in a mortgage instrument, deed of trust or other agreement creating a security interest, in case of a sale by a trustee under an agreement creating a security interest, tax sale, judicial sale other than a foreclosure sale, or sale under bankruptcy or receivership proceedings, of any units owned by a declarant or real property in a common interest community subject to development rights, a person acquiring title to all the property being sold, but only on his request, succeeds to all special declarant rights related to that property held by that declarant, or only to any rights reserved in the declaration pursuant to section 47-234 and held by that declarant to maintain models, sales offices, management offices and signs. The judgment or instrument conveying title shall provide for transfer of only the special declarant rights requested.\n\n(2) Unless otherwise provided in a mortgage instrument, a foreclosure of a mortgage on property in a common interest community subject to development rights operates to vest absolute title to the development rights related to the property being foreclosed and held by the declarant whose interest is being foreclosed in the foreclosing mortgagee, or in a redeeming defendant, or in a purchaser at a foreclosure auction unless the foreclosing mortgagee, in its complaint for foreclosure, indicates that those development rights are not part of the mortgaged property for which the mortgagee is seeking a foreclosure.\n\n(d) On foreclosure of a security interest, sale by a trustee under an agreement creating a security interest, tax sale, judicial sale, or sale under bankruptcy or receivership proceedings, of all interests in a common interest community owned by a declarant:\n\n(1) The declarant ceases to have any special declarant rights; and\n\n(2) The period of declarant control, as provided in subsection (d) of section 47-245 , terminates unless the judgment or instrument conveying title provides for transfer of all special declarant rights held by that declarant to a successor declarant.\n\n(e) The liabilities and obligations of a person who succeeds to special declarant rights are as follows:\n\n(1) A successor to any special declarant right who is an affiliate of a declarant is subject to all obligations and liabilities imposed on the transferor by this chapter or by the declaration.\n\n(2) A successor to any special declarant right, other than a successor described in subdivisions (3) or (4) of this subsection or a successor who is an affiliate of a declarant, is subject to the obligations and liabilities imposed by this chapter or the declaration: (A) On a declarant which relate to the successor's exercise or nonexercise of special declarant rights; or (B) on his transferor, other than: (i) Misrepresentations by any previous declarant; (ii) warranty obligations on improvements made and sold by any previous declarant, or made before the common interest community was created; (iii) breach of any fiduciary obligation by any previous declarant or his appointees to the executive board; or (iv) any liability or obligation imposed on the transferor as a result of the transferor's acts or omissions after the transfer.\n\n(3) A successor to only a right reserved in the declaration to maintain models, sales offices, and signs, as provided in section 47-234 , may not exercise any other special declarant right, and is not subject to any liability or obligation as a declarant, except the obligation to provide a public offering statement and any liability arising as a result thereof.\n\n(4) A successor to all special declarant rights held by a transferor who succeeded to those rights pursuant to a deed or other instrument of conveyance in lieu of foreclosure or a judgment or instrument conveying title under subsection (c), may declare in a recorded instrument the intention to hold those rights solely for transfer to another person. Thereafter, until transferring all special declarant rights to any person acquiring title to any unit or real property subject to development rights owned by the successor, or until recording an instrument permitting exercise of all those rights, that successor may not exercise any of those rights other than any right held by his transferor to control the executive board in accordance with subsection (d) of section 47-245 for the duration of any period of declarant control, and any attempted exercise of those rights is void. As long as a successor declarant may not exercise special declarant rights under this subsection, he is not subject to any liability or obligation as a declarant other than liability for his acts and omissions under subsection (d) of section 47-245 .\n\n(f) Nothing in this section subjects any successor to a special declarant right to any claims against or other obligations of a transferor declarant, other than claims and obligations arising under this chapter or the declaration."

The executive board and those committees may hold an executive session only during a regular or special meeting of the board or a committee. No final vote or action may be taken during an executive session. An executive session may be held only to: (A) Consult with the association's attorney concerning legal matters; (B) discuss existing or potential litigation or mediation, arbitration or administrative proceedings; (C) discuss labor or personnel matters; (D) discuss contracts, leases and other commercial transactions to purchase or provide goods or services currently being negotiated, including the review of bids or proposals, if premature general knowledge of those matters would place the association at a disadvantage; or (E) prevent public knowledge of the matter to be discussed if the executive board or committee determines that public knowledge would violate the privacy of any person.\n\n(2) For purposes of this section, a gathering of board members at which the board members do not conduct association business is not a meeting of the executive board. The executive board and its members may not use incidental or social gatherings of board members or any other method to evade the open meeting requirements of this section.\n\n(3) Notwithstanding any actions taken by not less than two-thirds consent of the entire executive board pursuant to subdivision (8) or (9) of this subsection, during and after the period of declarant control, the executive board shall meet at least two times a year at the common interest community or at a place convenient to the community. Those meetings, and after termination of the period of declarant control, all executive board meetings, shall be at the common interest community or at a place convenient to the community unless the bylaws are amended to vary the location of those meetings.\n\n(4) At each executive board meeting, the executive board shall provide a reasonable opportunity for unit owners to comment regarding any matter affecting the common interest community and the association.\n\n(5) Unless the meeting is included in a schedule given to the unit owners or the meeting is called to deal with an emergency, the secretary or other officer specified in the bylaws shall give notice of each executive board meeting to each board member and to the unit owners. The notice shall be given at least five days before the meeting and shall state the time, date, place and agenda of the meeting, except that notice of a meeting called to adopt, amend or repeal a rule shall be given in accordance with subsection (a) of section 47-261b . If notice of the meeting is included in a schedule given to the unit owners, the secretary or other officer specified in the bylaws shall make available an agenda for such meeting to each board member and to the unit owners not later than forty-eight hours prior to the meeting.\n\n(6) If any materials are distributed to the executive board before the meeting, the executive board at the same time shall make copies of those materials reasonably available to unit owners, except that the board need not make available copies of unapproved minutes or materials that are to be considered in executive session.\n\n(7) Unless prohibited by the declaration or bylaws, the executive board may meet by telephonic, video or other conferencing process if (A) the meeting notice states the conferencing process to be used and provides information explaining how unit owners may participate in the conference directly or by meeting at a central location or conference connection; and (B) the process provides all unit owners the opportunity to hear or perceive the discussion and offer comments as provided in subdivision (4) of this subsection.\n\n(8) The minutes of all executive board meetings shall contain a record of how each board member cast his or her vote on any final action proposed to be taken by the executive board, unless such action was approved either by unanimous consent of the board members or without objection by any board member.\n\n(9) Instead of meeting, the executive board may act by not less than two-thirds consent of all executive board members as documented in a record authenticated by its members, noting the consent or nonconsent of each executive board member. The secretary promptly shall give notice to all unit owners of any action taken by not less than two-thirds consent of all executive board members.\n\n(10) Even if an action by the executive board is not in compliance with this section, it is valid unless set aside by a court. A challenge to the validity of an action of the executive board for failure to comply with this section may not be brought more than sixty days after the minutes of the executive board of the meeting at which the action was taken are approved or the record of that action is distributed to unit owners, whichever is later.\n\n(c) Meetings of the association shall be conducted in accordance with the most recent edition of Roberts' Rules of Order Newly Revised unless (1) the declaration, bylaws or other law otherwise provides, or (2) two-thirds of the votes allocated to owners present at the meeting are cast to suspend those rules."

If the wrong occurred during any period of declarant control and the association gives the declarant reasonable notice of and an opportunity to defend against the action, the declarant who then controlled the association is liable to the association or to any unit owner for (1) all tort losses not covered by insurance suffered by the association or that unit owner, and (2) all costs that the association would not have incurred but for a breach of contract or other wrongful act or omission.\n\n(c) The declarant is liable to the association for all funds of the association collected during the period of declarant control which were not properly expended.\n\n(d) Whenever the declarant is liable to the association under this section, the declarant is also liable for all expenses of litigation, including reasonable attorney's fees, incurred by the association. Any statute of limitation affecting the association's right of action against a declarant under this chapter is tolled until the period of declarant control terminates. A unit owner is not precluded from maintaining an action contemplated by this section because he is a unit owner or a member or officer of the association. Liens resulting from judgments against the association are governed by section 47-259 .\n\n(e) No member of the executive board or officer of the association shall be subject to criminal liability for an alleged violation of the Fire Safety Code, the State Building Code or a municipal health, housing or safety code when, pursuant to subsection (b) of section 47-261e , the executive board of an association proposes a special assessment to cover the cost of the repairs necessary to ensure compliance with the terms of such codes and the special assessment is rejected by a vote of the unit owners."

The text of the notice may be in any form reasonably calculated to give notice of the general nature of the association's claims, including a list of the claimed defects. The notice may be delivered by any method of service and may be addressed to any person if the method of service used: (A) Provides actual notice to the person named in the claim; or (B) would be sufficient to give notice to the person in connection with commencement of an action by the association against the person.\n\n(2) Subject to subsection (e) of this section, the association may not institute a proceeding against a person until forty-five days after the association sends notice of its claim to that person.\n\n(3) During the time period set forth in subdivision (2) of this subsection, the declarant and any other person to which the association gave notice may present to the association a plan to repair or otherwise remedy the construction defects described in the notice. If the association does not receive a timely remediation plan from a person to which it gave notice, or if the association does not accept the terms of any remediation plan submitted, the association may institute a proceeding against the person.\n\n(4) If the association receives one or more timely remediation plans, the executive board shall consider promptly those remediation plans and notify the persons to which it directed notice whether the remediation plan is acceptable as presented, acceptable with stated conditions, or not accepted.\n\n(5) If the association accepts a remediation plan from a person the association seeks to hold liable for the claimed defect, or if a person agrees to stated conditions to an otherwise acceptable remediation plan, the parties shall agree on a period for implementation of the remediation plan. The association may not institute a proceeding against the person during the time the remediation plan is being diligently implemented.\n\n(6) Any statute of limitation affecting the association's right of action against a declarant or other person is tolled during the time period set forth in subdivision (2) of this subsection and during any extension of that time because a person to which notice was directed has commenced and is diligently pursuing the remediation plan.\n\n(b) After the time period set forth in subdivision (2) of subsection (a) of this section expires, whether or not the association agrees to any remediation plan, a proceeding may be instituted by: (1) The association against a person to which notice was directed which fails to submit a timely remediation plan, the plan of which is not acceptable, or which fails to pursue diligent implementation of that plan; or (2) a unit owner with respect to the owner's unit and any limited common elements assigned to that unit, regardless of any action of the association.\n\n(c) The provisions of this section do not preclude the association from making repairs necessary to mitigate damages or to correct any defect that poses a significant and immediate health or safety risk.\n\n(d) Subject to the other provisions of this section, the determination of whether and when the association may institute a proceeding described in this section may be made by the executive board. The declaration may not require a vote by any number or percentage of unit owners as a condition to institution of a proceeding.\n\n(e) The provisions of this section shall not prevent an association from seeking equitable relief, a remedy in aid of arbitration or a prejudgment remedy under chapter 903a at any time without complying with subdivision (1) or (2) of subsection (a) of this section.\n\n(f) If the time for termination of any period of declarant control occurs and the declarant has failed to comply with subsection (d), (f) or (h) of section 47-245 , the limitations set forth in this section and the association's authority to institute litigation shall not apply."
