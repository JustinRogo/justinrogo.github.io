However, it is recognized that law and policy relating generally to the provision of welfare services by a particular state should not be determined by interstate compact and will remain a matter for determination by that party state and its subdivisions. This compact shall be open for joinder by any state of the United States and the District of Columbia.\n\nARTICLE II\n\nAs used in this compact, the phrase “welfare service” shall mean and include: (1) Old age assistance; (2) aid to the blind; (3) temporary family assistance; (4) aid to the permanently and totally disabled; (5) general assistance or home relief, by whatever name known, for persons not eligible under other assistance categories; (6) child welfare services; (7) care of unwed mothers; (8) welfare medical services for those in need; provided that no party state shall be obligated to provide a welfare service which is not made available generally by its laws.\n\nARTICLE III\n\n(a) No person who has removed himself from one party state to another party state shall be ineligible for a welfare service in such other party state because of failure to meet that state's residence or settlement requirements for eligibility. The cost of providing a welfare service to any person made eligible therefor by reason of this compact shall be charged within the state in accordance with the laws of such state.\n\n(b) The appropriate official, department or agency of the state where application for a welfare service is made pursuant to this compact shall be entitled to request and receive any pertinent information available from any other party state with respect to such applicant.\n\nARTICLE IV\n\n(a) The duly constituted administrative authorities of any two or more party states may enter into supplementary agreements for the provision of any service or facility in the field of social welfare which may be in addition to those denominated as welfare services in this compact whenever the states concerned shall find that such agreements will improve social welfare, its services or facilities.

The compact administrators of the respective party states shall have power to promulgate reasonable regulations to carry out the terms and provisions of this compact.\n\nARTICLE VI\n\n(a) This compact shall enter into full force and effect as to any state when enacted by it into law and such state shall thereafter be a party thereto with any and all states legally joining therein.\n\n(b) A state party to this compact may withdraw therefrom by enacting a statute repealing the same. Such withdrawal shall take effect six months after notice thereof has been communicated officially and in writing to the governors and compact administrators of all other party states. However, the withdrawal of any state shall not affect the rights of any person who is receiving a welfare service pursuant to the provisions of this compact.\n\n(c) Withdrawal from any supplementary agreement made pursuant to Article IV shall be in accordance with the terms of such agreement.\n\nARTICLE VII\n\nThis compact shall be liberally construed so as to effectuate the purposes thereof.

Such application shall be mailed to the commissioner within sixty days after the rendition of such decision. The commissioner shall thereupon hold a fair hearing within thirty days from receipt thereof and shall, at least ten days prior to the date of such hearing, mail a notice, giving the time and place thereof, to such aggrieved person, or if the application concerns a denial of or failure to provide emergency housing, the commissioner shall hold a fair hearing within four business days from receipt thereof, and shall make all reasonable efforts to provide notice of the time and place of the fair hearing to such aggrieved person at least one business day prior to said hearing. A reasonable period of continuance may be granted for good cause. The aggrieved person shall appear personally at the hearing, unless his physical or mental condition precludes appearing in person, and may be represented by an attorney or other authorized representative. A stenographic or mechanical record shall be made of each hearing, but need not be transcribed except (1) in the event of an appeal from the decision of the hearing officer or (2) if a copy is requested by the aggrieved person, in either of which cases it shall be furnished by the Commissioner of Social Services without charge. The Commissioner of Social Services and any person authorized by him to conduct any hearing under the provisions of this section shall have power to administer oaths and take testimony under oath relative to the matter of the hearing and may subpoena witnesses and require the production of records, papers and documents pertinent to such hearing. No witness under subpoena authorized to be issued by the provisions of this section shall be excused from testifying or from producing records, papers or documents on the ground that such testimony or the production of such records or other documentary evidence would tend to incriminate him, but such evidence or the records or papers so produced shall not be used in any criminal proceeding against him. If any person disobeys such process or, having appeared in obedience thereto, refuses to answer any pertinent question put to him by the commissioner or his authorized agent or to produce any records and papers pursuant thereto, the commissioner or his agent may apply to the superior court for the judicial district of Hartford or for the judicial district wherein the person resides, or to any judge of said court if the same is not in session, setting forth such disobedience to process or refusal to answer, and said court or such judge shall cite such person to appear before said court or such judge to answer such question or to produce such records and papers and, upon his refusal to do so, shall commit such person to a community correctional center until he testifies, but not for a longer period than sixty days. Notwithstanding the serving of the term of such commitment by any person, the commissioner or his agent may proceed with such inquiry and examination as if the witness had not previously been called upon to testify. Officers who serve subpoenas issued by the commissioner or under his authority and witnesses attending hearings conducted by him hereunder shall receive like fees and compensation as officers and witnesses in the courts of this state to be paid on vouchers of the commissioner on order of the Comptroller.",

Such decision shall be based upon all the evidence introduced before the commissioner or the commissioner's designated hearing officer and all pertinent provisions of law, regulations and departmental policy, and shall supersede the decision made without a hearing. Notice of such final decision shall be given to the aggrieved person by mailing such person a copy thereof not later than one business day after the decision is rendered. Such decision after hearing shall be final except as provided in subsections (c) and (d) of this section. Failure by the commissioner or the commissioner's designated hearing officer to render a final decision within the time limits set forth in this subsection shall not of itself be deemed an approval of the aggrieved person's requested relief on the merits.\n\n(b) If the commissioner or the commissioner's designated hearing officer fails to render a final decision within the time limits set forth in subsection (a) of this section, the aggrieved person may file a request for a final decision with the designated hearing officer. Such officer shall render such decision not later than twenty days after receiving such request.\n\n(c) The applicant for a fair hearing, if aggrieved, may appeal the final decision in accordance with section 4-183 . Appeals from decisions of said commissioner shall be privileged cases to be heard by the court as soon after the return day as shall be practicable.\n\n(d) The commissioner may, for good cause shown by an aggrieved person, extend the time for filing an appeal to Superior Court beyond the time limitations of section 4-183 , as set forth below:\n\n(1) Any aggrieved person who is authorized to appeal a decision of the commissioner, pursuant to subsection (c) of this section, but who fails to serve or file a timely appeal to the Superior Court pursuant to section 4-183 , may, as provided in this subsection, petition that the commissioner, for good cause shown, extend the time for filing any such appeal. Such a petition must be filed with the commissioner in writing and contain a complete and detailed explanation of the reasons that precluded the petitioner from serving or filing an appeal within the statutory time period. Such petition must also be accompanied by all available documentary evidence that supports or corroborates the reasons advanced for the extension request. In no event shall a petition for extension be considered or approved if filed later than ninety days after the rendition of the final decision. The decision as to whether to grant an extension shall be made consistent with the provisions of subdivision (2) of this subsection and shall be final and not subject to judicial review.\n\n(2) In determining whether to grant a good cause extension, as provided for in this subsection, the commissioner, or the commissioner's authorized designee, shall, without the necessity of further hearing, review and, as necessary, verify the reasons advanced by the petition in justification of the extension request. A determination that good cause prevented the filing of a timely appeal shall be issued in writing and shall enable the petitioner to serve and file an appeal within the time provisions of section 4-183 , from the date of the decision granting an extension. The circumstances that precluded the petitioner from filing a timely appeal, and which may be deemed good cause for purposes of granting an extension petition, include, but are not limited to: (A) Serious illness or incapacity of the petitioner which has been documented as materially affecting the conduct of the petitioner's personal affairs; (B) a death or serious illness in the petitioner's immediate family that has been documented as precluding the petitioner from perfecting a timely appeal; (C) incorrect or misleading information given to the petitioner by the agency, relating to the appeal time period, and shown to have been materially relied on by the petitioner as the basis for failure to file a timely appeal; (D) evidence that the petitioner did not receive notice of the agency decision; and (E) other unforeseen and unavoidable circumstances of an exceptional nature which prevented the filing of a timely appeal."

A vendor who is ineligible for federal financial participation shall be ineligible for participation in such programs. No vendor shall be eligible for reimbursement for any goods provided or services performed by a person convicted of a crime involving fraud in such programs. The convicted person may request a hearing concerning such ineligibility for reimbursement pursuant to sections 4-176e to 4-180a , inclusive, and 4-181a provided such request is filed in writing with the Commissioner of Social Services within ten days of the date of written notice by the commissioner to the person of such ineligibility.

Prior to the commissioner's acceptance of a provider agreement or at any time upon written request by the commissioner, the vendor shall furnish the commissioner with the identity of any person convicted of a crime involving fraud in such programs who has an ownership or control interest in the vendor or who is an agent or managing employee. The commissioner shall terminate, refuse to enter into or renew an agreement with a vendor, except a vendor providing room and board and services pursuant to section 17b-340 , if such convicted person has such interest or is such agent or employee. In the case of a vendor providing room and board and services pursuant to said section 17b-340 , the commissioner may terminate, refuse to enter into or renew an agreement after consideration of any adverse impact on beneficiaries of such termination or refusal.\n\n(c) The Department of Social Services shall distribute to all vendors who are providers in the medical assistance program a copy of the rules, regulations, standards and laws governing the program.

No audit shall include claims paid more than thirty-six months from the date claims are selected for the audit.

The commissioner shall accept a scanned copy of documentation supporting a claim when the original documentation is unavailable.\n\n(3) Any clerical error discovered in a record or document produced for any such audit shall not of itself constitute a wilful violation of program rules unless proof of intent to commit fraud or otherwise violate program rules is established. In determining which providers shall be subject to audits, the Commissioner of Social Services may give consideration to the history of a provider's compliance in addition to other criteria used to select a provider for an audit.\n\n(4) A finding of overpayment or underpayment to a provider in a program operated or administered by the department pursuant to this chapter or chapter 319t, 319v, 319y or 319ff, except a provider for which rates are established pursuant to section 17b-340 , shall not be based on extrapolation unless the total net amount of extrapolated overpayment calculated from a statistically valid sampling and extrapolation methodology exceeds one and three-quarters per cent of total claims paid to the provider for the audit period.\n\n(5) In conducting any audit pursuant to this subsection, the commissioner, or any entity with which the commissioner contracts to conduct such audit, shall accept (A) as sufficient proof of a written order: A photocopy, facsimile image, an electronically maintained document or original pen and ink document, and (B) as sufficient proof of delivery of a covered item or service: A receipt signed by the recipient of medical assistance or a nursing facility representative or, in the case of delivery of a covered item or service by a shipping or delivery service, a supplier's detailed shipping invoice and the delivery service tracking information substantiating delivery.

A provider, in complying with the requirements of any such audit, shall be allowed not less than thirty days to provide documentation in connection with any discrepancy discovered and brought to the attention of such provider in the course of any such audit. Such documentation may include evidence that errors concerning payment and billing resulted from a provider's transition to a new payment or billing service or accounting system. The commissioner shall not calculate an overpayment based on extrapolation or attempt to recover such extrapolated overpayment when the provider presents credible evidence that an error by the commissioner, or any entity with which the commissioner contracts to conduct an audit pursuant to this subsection, caused the overpayment, provided the commissioner may recover the amount of the original overpayment.\n\n(6) The commissioner, or any entity with which the commissioner contracts, for the purpose of conducting an audit of a provider of any of the programs operated or administered by the department pursuant to this chapter or chapter 319t, 319v, 319y or 319ff, except a service provider for which rates are established pursuant to section 17b-340 , shall produce a preliminary written report concerning any audit conducted pursuant to this subsection, and such preliminary report shall be provided to the provider that was the subject of the audit not later than sixty days after the conclusion of such audit.\n\n(7) The commissioner, or any entity with which the commissioner contracts, for the purpose of conducting an audit of a provider of any of the programs operated or administered by the department pursuant to this chapter or chapter 319t, 319v, 319y or 319ff, except a service provider for which rates are established pursuant to section 17b-340 , shall, following the issuance of the preliminary report pursuant to subdivision (6) of this subsection, hold an exit conference with any provider that was the subject of any audit pursuant to this subsection for the purpose of discussing the preliminary report. Such provider may present evidence at such exit conference refuting findings in the preliminary report.\n\n(8) The commissioner, or any entity with which the commissioner contracts, for the purpose of conducting an audit of a service provider, shall produce a final written report concerning any audit conducted pursuant to this subsection. Such final written report shall be provided to the provider that was the subject of the audit not later than sixty days after the date of the exit conference conducted pursuant to subdivision (7) of this subsection, unless the commissioner, or any entity with which the commissioner contracts for the purpose of conducting an audit of a service provider, agrees to a later date or there are other referrals or investigations pending concerning the provider.\n\n(9) Any provider aggrieved by a decision contained in a final written report issued pursuant to subdivision (8) of this subsection may, not later than thirty days after the receipt of the final report, request, in writing, a contested case hearing in accordance with chapter 54. Such request shall contain a detailed written description of each specific item of aggrievement. The designee of the commissioner who presides over the hearing shall be impartial and shall not be an employee of the Department of Social Services Office of Quality Assurance or an employee of an entity with which the commissioner contracts for the purpose of conducting an audit of a service provider. A provider shall be permitted to raise during such hearing that a negative audit finding was due to a provider's compliance with a state or federal law or regulation. Following review on all items of aggrievement, the designee of the commissioner who presides over the hearing shall issue a final decision not later than ninety days following the close of evidence or the date on which final briefs are filed, whichever occurs later. When a provider requests a hearing pursuant to this subdivision, and the provider is contesting an overpayment amount based on extrapolation, the Department of Social Services shall not recoup the overpayment amount at issue until a final decision is issued after the hearing.\n\n(10) The provisions of this subsection shall not apply to any audit conducted by the Medicaid Fraud Control Unit established within the Office of the Chief State's Attorney.\n\n(11) The commissioner shall provide free training to providers on how to enter claims to avoid errors and shall post information on the department's Internet web site concerning the auditing process, standard audit procedures and methods to avoid clerical errors. The commissioner shall establish and publish on the department's Internet web site audit protocols to assist the Medicaid provider community in developing programs to improve compliance with Medicaid requirements under state and federal laws and regulations, provided audit protocols may not be relied upon to create a substantive or procedural right or benefit enforceable at law or in equity by any person, including a corporation. The commissioner shall establish audit protocols for specific providers or categories of service, including, but not limited to: (A) Licensed home health agencies, (B) drug and alcohol treatment centers, (C) durable medical equipment, (D) hospital outpatient services, (E) physician and nursing services, (F) dental services, (G) behavioral health services, (H) pharmaceutical services, (I) emergency and nonemergency medical transportation services, and (J) homemaker companion services. The commissioner shall ensure that the Department of Social Services, or any entity with which the commissioner contracts to conduct an audit pursuant to this subsection, has on staff or consults with, as needed, a medical or dental professional who is experienced in the use and review of electronic medical records, and the treatment, billing and coding procedures used by the provider being audited. The commissioner shall ensure that an auditor reviews any electronic medical record associated with a patient chart included in the audit."

              "(a) The Department of Social Services shall administer a temporary family assistance program under which cash assistance shall be provided to eligible families in accordance with the temporary assistance for needy families program, established pursuant to the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996. The Commissioner of Social Services may operate portions of the temporary family assistance program as a solely state-funded program, separate from the federal temporary assistance for needy families program, if the commissioner determines that doing so will enable the state to avoid fiscal penalties under the temporary assistance for needy families program. Families receiving assistance under the solely state-funded portion of the temporary family assistance program shall be subject to the same conditions of eligibility as those receiving assistance under the federal temporary assistance for needy families program. Under the temporary family assistance program, benefits shall be provided to a family for not longer than thirty-six months, except as provided in subsections (b) and (c) of this section. For the purpose of calculating said thirty-six-month time limit, months of assistance received on and after January 1, 1996, pursuant to time limits under the aid to families with dependent children program, shall be included. For purposes of this section, “family” means one or more individuals who apply for or receive assistance together under the temporary family assistance program. If the commissioner determines that federal law allows individuals not otherwise in an eligible covered group for the temporary family assistance program to become covered, such family may also, at the discretion of the commissioner, be composed of (1) a pregnant woman, or (2) a parent, both parents or other caretaker relative and at least one child who is under the age of eighteen, or who is under the age of nineteen and a full-time student in a secondary school or its equivalent. A caretaker relative shall be related to the child or children by blood, marriage or adoption or shall be the legal guardian of such a child or pursuing legal proceedings necessary to achieve guardianship. If the commissioner elects to allow state eligibility consistent with any change in federal law, the commissioner may administratively transfer any qualifying family cases under the cash assistance portion of the state-administered general assistance program to the temporary family assistance program without regard to usual eligibility and enrollment procedures. If such families become an ineligible coverage group under the federal law, the commissioner shall administratively transfer such families back to the cash assistance portion of the state-administered general assistance program without regard to usual eligibility and enrollment procedures to the degree that such families are eligible for the state program.",
              "(b) The Commissioner of Social Services shall exempt a family from such time-limited benefits for circumstances including, but not limited to: (1) A family with a needy caretaker relative who is incapacitated or of an advanced age, as defined by the commissioner, if there is no other nonexempt caretaker relative in the household; (2) a family with a needy caretaker relative who is needed in the home because of the incapacity of another member of the household, if there is no other nonexempt caretaker relative in the household; (3) a family with a caretaker relative who is not legally responsible for the dependent children in the household if such relative's needs are not considered in calculating the amount of the benefit and there is no other nonexempt caretaker relative in the household; (4) a family with a caretaker relative caring for a child who is under one year of age if there is no other nonexempt caretaker relative in the household; (5) a family with a pregnant or postpartum caretaker relative if a physician has indicated that such relative is unable to work and there is no other nonexempt caretaker relative in the household; (6) a family with a caretaker relative determined by the commissioner to be unemployable and there is no other nonexempt caretaker relative in the household; and (7) minor parents attending and satisfactorily completing high school or high school equivalency programs.",
              "(c) A family who is subject to time-limited benefits may petition the Commissioner of Social Services for six-month extensions of such benefits. The commissioner shall grant not more than two extensions to such family who has made a good faith effort to comply with the requirements of the program and despite such effort has a total family income below one hundred per cent of the federal poverty level, or has encountered circumstances preventing employment including, but not limited to: (1) Domestic violence or physical harm to such family's children; or (2) other circumstances beyond such family's control. The commissioner shall disregard ninety dollars of earned income in determining applicable family income. The commissioner may grant a subsequent six-month extension if each adult in the family meets one or more of the following criteria: (A) The adult is precluded from engaging in employment activities due to domestic violence or another reason beyond the adult's control; (B) the adult has two or more substantiated barriers to employment including, but not limited to, the lack of available child care, substance abuse or addiction, severe mental or physical health problems, one or more severe learning disabilities, domestic violence or a child who has a serious physical or behavioral health problem; or (C) the adult is employed and works less than thirty-five hours per week due to (i) a documented medical impairment that limits the adult's hours of employment, provided the adult works the maximum number of hours that the medical condition permits, or (ii) the need to care for a disabled member of the adult's household, provided the adult works the maximum number of hours the adult's caregiving responsibilities permit. Families receiving temporary family assistance shall be notified by the department of the right to petition for such extensions. Notwithstanding the provisions of this section, the commissioner shall not provide benefits under the state's temporary family assistance program to a family that is subject to the thirty-six-month benefit limit and has received benefits beginning on or after October 1, 1996, if such benefits result in that family's receiving more than sixty months of time-limited benefits unless that family experiences domestic violence, as defined in Section 402(a)(7)(B), P.L. 104-193. For the purpose of calculating said sixty-month limit: (I) A month shall count toward the limit if the family receives assistance for any day of the month, provided any months of temporary family assistance received during the public health emergency declared by Governor Ned Lamont related to the COVID-19 pandemic shall not be included, and (II) a month in which a family receives temporary assistance for needy families benefits that are issued from a jurisdiction other than Connecticut shall count toward the limit.",
              "(d) (1) Under said program, no family shall be eligible that has total gross earnings exceeding the federal poverty level, however, in the calculation of the benefit amount for eligible families and previously eligible families that become ineligible temporarily because of receipt of workers' compensation benefits by a family member who subsequently returns to work immediately after the period of receipt of such benefits, earned income shall be disregarded up to the federal poverty level. On and after October 1, 2023, the commissioner shall not deny a family assistance under said program on the basis of such family's assets unless such assets exceed six thousand dollars. Except when determining eligibility for a six-month extension of benefits pursuant to subsection (c) of this section, the commissioner shall disregard the first fifty dollars per month of income attributable to current child support that a family receives in determining eligibility and benefit levels for temporary family assistance. Any current child support in excess of fifty dollars per month collected by the department on behalf of an eligible child shall be considered in determining eligibility but shall not be considered when calculating benefits and shall be taken as reimbursement for assistance paid under this section, except that when the current child support collected exceeds the family's monthly award of temporary family assistance benefits plus fifty dollars, the current child support shall be paid to the family and shall be considered when calculating benefits.",
              "(2) Notwithstanding the provisions of subdivision (1) of this subsection, on and after January 1, 2024, in the first month in which a family's total gross earnings exceed one hundred per cent of the federal poverty level and for a period not to exceed six consecutive months, the department shall disregard, for purposes of eligibility, a family's total gross earnings in an amount not to exceed two hundred thirty per cent of the federal poverty level. If a family's total gross earnings are an amount between one hundred seventy-one per cent and two hundred thirty per cent of the federal poverty level, the department shall reduce the household's benefit by twenty per cent for the months in which earnings are between one hundred seventy-one per cent and two hundred thirty per cent of the federal poverty level.",
              "(e) A family receiving assistance under said program shall cooperate with child support enforcement, under title IV-D of the Social Security Act. A family shall be ineligible for benefits for failure to cooperate with child support enforcement.",
              "(f) A family leaving assistance at the end of (1) said thirty-six-month time limit, or (2) the sixty-month limit shall have an interview for the purpose of being informed of services that may continue to be available to such family, including employment services available through the Labor Department. Such interview shall include (A) a determination of benefits available to the family provided by the Department of Social Services; and (B) a determination of whether such family is eligible for supplemental nutrition assistance or Medicaid. Information and referrals shall be made to such a family for services and benefits including, but not limited to, the earned income tax credit, rental subsidies emergency housing, employment services and energy assistance.",
              "(g) Notwithstanding section 17b-104 , commencing on July 1, 2023, the Commissioner of Social Services shall provide an annual cost-of-living adjustment in temporary family assistance benefits equal to the most recent percentage increase in the consumer price index for urban consumers whenever funds appropriated for temporary family assistance lapse at the close of any fiscal year and such adjustment has not otherwise been included in the budget for the assistance program, provided the increase would not create a budget deficiency in succeeding years. The commissioner shall provide a prorated benefit increase from such available lapsed funds in any fiscal year when such funds are not sufficient to cover a cost-of-living adjustment in accordance with this subsection.",
              "(h) An applicant or recipient of temporary family assistance who is adversely affected by a decision of the Commissioner of Social Services may request and shall be provided a hearing in accordance with section 17b-60 ."

            "text": "(a) The Department of Social Services shall administer a temporary family assistance program under which cash assistance shall be provided to eligible families in accordance with the temporary assistance for needy families program, established pursuant to the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996. The Commissioner of Social Services may operate portions of the temporary family assistance program as a solely state-funded program, separate from the federal temporary assistance for needy families program, if the commissioner determines that doing so will enable the state to avoid fiscal penalties under the temporary assistance for needy families program. Families receiving assistance under the solely state-funded portion of the temporary family assistance program shall be subject to the same conditions of eligibility as those receiving assistance under the federal temporary assistance for needy families program. Under the temporary family assistance program, benefits shall be provided to a family for not longer than thirty-six months, except as provided in subsections (b) and (c) of this section. For the purpose of calculating said thirty-six-month time limit, months of assistance received on and after January 1, 1996, pursuant to time limits under the aid to families with dependent children program, shall be included. For purposes of this section, “family” means one or more individuals who apply for or receive assistance together under the temporary family assistance program. If the commissioner determines that federal law allows individuals not otherwise in an eligible covered group for the temporary family assistance program to become covered, such family may also, at the discretion of the commissioner, be composed of (1) a pregnant woman, or (2) a parent, both parents or other caretaker relative and at least one child who is under the age of eighteen, or who is under the age of nineteen and a full-time student in a secondary school or its equivalent. A caretaker relative shall be related to the child or children by blood, marriage or adoption or shall be the legal guardian of such a child or pursuing legal proceedings necessary to achieve guardianship. If the commissioner elects to allow state eligibility consistent with any change in federal law, the commissioner may administratively transfer any qualifying family cases under the cash assistance portion of the state-administered general assistance program to the temporary family assistance program without regard to usual eligibility and enrollment procedures. If such families become an ineligible coverage group under the federal law, the commissioner shall administratively transfer such families back to the cash assistance portion of the state-administered general assistance program without regard to usual eligibility and enrollment procedures to the degree that such families are eligible for the state program.\n\n(b) The Commissioner of Social Services shall exempt a family from such time-limited benefits for circumstances including, but not limited to: (1) A family with a needy caretaker relative who is incapacitated or of an advanced age, as defined by the commissioner, if there is no other nonexempt caretaker relative in the household; (2) a family with a needy caretaker relative who is needed in the home because of the incapacity of another member of the household, if there is no other nonexempt caretaker relative in the household; (3) a family with a caretaker relative who is not legally responsible for the dependent children in the household if such relative's needs are not considered in calculating the amount of the benefit and there is no other nonexempt caretaker relative in the household; (4) a family with a caretaker relative caring for a child who is under one year of age if there is no other nonexempt caretaker relative in the household; (5) a family with a pregnant or postpartum caretaker relative if a physician has indicated that such relative is unable to work and there is no other nonexempt caretaker relative in the household; (6) a family with a caretaker relative determined by the commissioner to be unemployable and there is no other nonexempt caretaker relative in the household; and (7) minor parents attending and satisfactorily completing high school or high school equivalency programs.\n\n(c) A family who is subject to time-limited benefits may petition the Commissioner of Social Services for six-month extensions of such benefits. The commissioner shall grant not more than two extensions to such family who has made a good faith effort to comply with the requirements of the program and despite such effort has a total family income below one hundred per cent of the federal poverty level, or has encountered circumstances preventing employment including, but not limited to: (1) Domestic violence or physical harm to such family's children; or (2) other circumstances beyond such family's control. The commissioner shall disregard ninety dollars of earned income in determining applicable family income. The commissioner may grant a subsequent six-month extension if each adult in the family meets one or more of the following criteria: (A) The adult is precluded from engaging in employment activities due to domestic violence or another reason beyond the adult's control; (B) the adult has two or more substantiated barriers to employment including, but not limited to, the lack of available child care, substance abuse or addiction, severe mental or physical health problems, one or more severe learning disabilities, domestic violence or a child who has a serious physical or behavioral health problem; or (C) the adult is employed and works less than thirty-five hours per week due to (i) a documented medical impairment that limits the adult's hours of employment, provided the adult works the maximum number of hours that the medical condition permits, or (ii) the need to care for a disabled member of the adult's household, provided the adult works the maximum number of hours the adult's caregiving responsibilities permit. Families receiving temporary family assistance shall be notified by the department of the right to petition for such extensions. Notwithstanding the provisions of this section, the commissioner shall not provide benefits under the state's temporary family assistance program to a family that is subject to the thirty-six-month benefit limit and has received benefits beginning on or after October 1, 1996, if such benefits result in that family's receiving more than sixty months of time-limited benefits unless that family experiences domestic violence, as defined in Section 402(a)(7)(B), P.L. 104-193. For the purpose of calculating said sixty-month limit: (I) A month shall count toward the limit if the family receives assistance for any day of the month, provided any months of temporary family assistance received during the public health emergency declared by Governor Ned Lamont related to the COVID-19 pandemic shall not be included, and (II) a month in which a family receives temporary assistance for needy families benefits that are issued from a jurisdiction other than Connecticut shall count toward the limit.\n\n(d) (1) Under said program, no family shall be eligible that has total gross earnings exceeding the federal poverty level, however, in the calculation of the benefit amount for eligible families and previously eligible families that become ineligible temporarily because of receipt of workers' compensation benefits by a family member who subsequently returns to work immediately after the period of receipt of such benefits, earned income shall be disregarded up to the federal poverty level. On and after October 1, 2023, the commissioner shall not deny a family assistance under said program on the basis of such family's assets unless such assets exceed six thousand dollars. Except when determining eligibility for a six-month extension of benefits pursuant to subsection (c) of this section, the commissioner shall disregard the first fifty dollars per month of income attributable to current child support that a family receives in determining eligibility and benefit levels for temporary family assistance. Any current child support in excess of fifty dollars per month collected by the department on behalf of an eligible child shall be considered in determining eligibility but shall not be considered when calculating benefits and shall be taken as reimbursement for assistance paid under this section, except that when the current child support collected exceeds the family's monthly award of temporary family assistance benefits plus fifty dollars, the current child support shall be paid to the family and shall be considered when calculating benefits.\n\n(2) Notwithstanding the provisions of subdivision (1) of this subsection, on and after January 1, 2024, in the first month in which a family's total gross earnings exceed one hundred per cent of the federal poverty level and for a period not to exceed six consecutive months, the department shall disregard, for purposes of eligibility, a family's total gross earnings in an amount not to exceed two hundred thirty per cent of the federal poverty level. If a family's total gross earnings are an amount between one hundred seventy-one per cent and two hundred thirty per cent of the federal poverty level, the department shall reduce the household's benefit by twenty per cent for the months in which earnings are between one hundred seventy-one per cent and two hundred thirty per cent of the federal poverty level.\n\n(e) A family receiving assistance under said program shall cooperate with child support enforcement, under title IV-D of the Social Security Act. A family shall be ineligible for benefits for failure to cooperate with child support enforcement.\n\n(f) A family leaving assistance at the end of (1) said thirty-six-month time limit, or (2) the sixty-month limit shall have an interview for the purpose of being informed of services that may continue to be available to such family, including employment services available through the Labor Department. Such interview shall include (A) a determination of benefits available to the family provided by the Department of Social Services; and (B) a determination of whether such family is eligible for supplemental nutrition assistance or Medicaid. Information and referrals shall be made to such a family for services and benefits including, but not limited to, the earned income tax credit, rental subsidies emergency housing, employment services and energy assistance.\n\n(g) Notwithstanding section 17b-104 , commencing on July 1, 2023, the Commissioner of Social Services shall provide an annual cost-of-living adjustment in temporary family assistance benefits equal to the most recent percentage increase in the consumer price index for urban consumers whenever funds appropriated for temporary family assistance lapse at the close of any fiscal year and such adjustment has not otherwise been included in the budget for the assistance program, provided the increase would not create a budget deficiency in succeeding years. The commissioner shall provide a prorated benefit increase from such available lapsed funds in any fiscal year when such funds are not sufficient to cover a cost-of-living adjustment in accordance with this subsection.\n\n(h) An applicant or recipient of temporary family assistance who is adversely affected by a decision of the Commissioner of Social Services may request and shall be provided a hearing in accordance with section 17b-60 ."

            "text": "(a) There is created within the Department of Social Services the Office of Child Support Services. The office shall be administered by a director and shall act as the single and separate organizational unit to coordinate, plan and publish the state child support enforcement plan for the implementation of Title IV-D of the Social Security Act, as amended, as required by federal law and regulations. The office shall provide for the development and implementation of all child support services, including the administration of withholding of earnings, in accordance with the provisions of Title IV-D of the Social Security Act, as amended.\n\n(b) (1) The Commissioner of Social Services shall investigate the financial condition of the parent or parents of: (A) Any child applying for or receiving assistance under (i) the temporary family assistance program pursuant to section 17b-112 , which may be referred to as “TFA” for the purposes of this section, or (ii) the Medicaid program pursuant to section 17b-261 , (B) any child seeking IV-D child support enforcement services pursuant to subdivision (1) of subsection (h) of this section, and (C) any child committed to the care of the Commissioner of Children and Families who is receiving payments in the foster care program and for whom a referral to the Office of Child Support Services is made under section 46b-130 , and shall determine the financial liability of such parent or parents for the child.\n\n(2) The Office of Child Support Services may, upon notice to the obligor and obligee, redirect payments for the support of all such children to either the state of Connecticut or the present custodial party, as their interests may appear, provided neither the obligor nor the obligee objects in writing within ten business days from the mailing date of such notice. Any such notice shall be sent by first class mail to the most recent address of such obligor and obligee, as recorded in the state case registry pursuant to section 46b-218 , and a copy of such notice shall be filed with the court or family support magistrate if both the obligor and obligee fail to object to the redirected payments within ten business days from the mailing date of such notice. All payments shall be distributed as required by Title IV-D of the Social Security Act.\n\n(3) Notwithstanding subdivision (2) of this subsection or subparagraph (F) of subdivision (1) of subsection (u) of section 46b-231 , the Office of Child Support Services or a support enforcement agency under cooperative agreement with the Office of Child Support Services shall redirect payments for the support of children described in subparagraphs (A)(i) and (C) of subdivision (1) of this subsection to the state of Connecticut effective on the date of the assistance grant. Upon such redirection, the Office of Child Support Services or support enforcement agency shall notify the obligor and obligee as described in subdivision (2) of this subsection if assistance is being received by a new custodial party on behalf of such child and, if an objection to redirection is received in accordance with said subdivision (2), shall refund to the obligee of the support order any money retained by the state during the period of redirection that is due such obligee.\n\n(c) The Office of Child Support Services shall enter into cooperative agreements with appropriate officials of the Judicial Branch and law enforcement officials to assist in administering the child support enforcement plan and with respect to other matters of common concern in the area of child support enforcement. Officers of the Judicial Branch and law enforcement officials authorized and required to enter into cooperative agreements with the Office of Child Support Services include, but are not limited to, officials of the Superior Court and the office of the Attorney General. Such cooperative agreements shall contain performance standards to address the mandatory provisions of both state and federal laws and federal regulations concerning child support.\n\n(d) The Office of Child Support Services shall have authority to determine on a periodic basis whether any individuals who owe child support obligations are receiving unemployment compensation. In IV-D cases, the office may authorize the collection of any such obligations owed by an individual receiving unemployment compensation through an agreement with the individual or a court order pursuant to section 52-362 , under which a portion of the individual's unemployment compensation is withheld and forwarded to the state acting by and through the IV-D agency. As used in this section, “unemployment compensation” means any compensation payable under chapter 567, including amounts payable by the administrator of the unemployment compensation law pursuant to an agreement under any federal law providing for compensation, assistance or allowances with respect to unemployment.\n\n(e) The Office of Child Support Services shall enter into purchase of service agreements with other state officials, departments and agencies which do not have judicial or law enforcement authority, including, but not limited to, the Commissioner of Administrative Services, to assist in administering the child support enforcement plan. The Office of Child Support Services shall have authority to enter into such agreements with the Labor Commissioner and to withhold unemployment compensation pursuant to subsection (d) of this section and section 31-227 .\n\n(f) The Office of Child Support Services shall have the sole responsibility to make referrals to the federal Parent Locator Service established pursuant to 88 Stat. 2353 (1975), 42 USC 653, as amended, for the purpose of locating deserting parents.\n\n(g) The Office of Child Support Services shall have the sole responsibility to make recommendations to the Governor and the General Assembly for needed program legislation to ensure implementation of Title IV-D of the Social Security Act, as amended.\n\n(h) (1) The Office of Child Support Services shall provide, or arrange to provide through one or more of the state officials, departments and agencies, the same services for obtaining and enforcing child support orders in cases in which children are not beneficiaries of TFA, Medicaid or foster care as in cases where children are the beneficiaries of TFA, Medicaid or foster care. Such services shall also be made available to residents of other states on the same terms as to residents of this state. Support services in cases other than TFA, Medicaid or foster care will be provided upon application to the Office of Child Support Services by the person seeking to enforce a child support obligation and the payment of an application fee, pursuant to the provisions of subsection (i) of this section.\n\n(2) In addition to the application fee, the Office of Child Support Services may assess costs incurred for the establishment, enforcement or modification of a support order in cases other than TFA, Medicaid or foster care. Such assessment shall be based on a fee schedule adopted by the Department of Social Services pursuant to chapter 54. The fee schedule to be charged in such cases shall be made available to any individual upon request. The Office of Child Support Services shall adopt procedures for the notification of Superior Court judges and family support magistrates when a fee has been assessed upon an obligee for support services and a Superior Court judge or a family support magistrate shall order the obligor to pay any such assessment to the Office of Child Support Services. In cases where such order is not entered, the obligee shall pay an amount based on a sliding scale not to exceed the obligee's ability to pay. The Department of Social Services shall adopt such sliding scale pursuant to chapter 54.\n\n(3) The Office of Child Support Services shall also, in the case of an individual who never received temporary assistance for needy families and for whom the state has collected at least five hundred fifty dollars of support in a one-year period, impose an annual fee of thirty-five dollars for each case in which services are furnished. The annual fee shall be (A) retained by the state from the support collected on behalf of the individual, but not from the first five hundred fifty dollars collected, (B) paid by the individual applying for the services, (C) recovered from the noncustodial parent, or (D) paid by the state.\n\n(i) In child support cases other than TFA, Medicaid or foster care, the state shall impose an application fee in an amount necessary to comply with federal law and regulations under Title IV-D of the Social Security Act, which fee shall be paid by the state. The amount of such fee shall be established by regulations adopted, in accordance with the provisions of chapter 54, by the Commissioner of Social Services and shall not exceed twenty-five dollars or such higher or lower amount as the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services may determine to be appropriate for any fiscal year to reflect increases or decreases in administrative costs. The court in which a child support obligation is sought to be enforced may order the obligor to reimburse the state for such application fee. Recipients of TFA, Medicaid or foster care whose eligibility for aid is terminated shall be entitled to continuation of child support enforcement services without requiring an application or the payment of an application fee.\n\n(j) (1) The Commissioner of Social Services may accept for deposit in the General Fund all allotments of federal funds, and shall conform to federal requirements necessary for the receipt of federal matching grants that are not prohibited by the general statutes, including, but not limited to, distribution of collected support and operation of an automated centralized collection and disbursement unit, which shall be known as the “State Disbursement Unit”.\n\n(2) The commissioner may implement electronic funds transfer for all support payments processed through the State Disbursement Unit. The commissioner may establish a debit account at a financial institution, as defined in section 469A(d)(1) of the Social Security Act, for any recipient of support payments whose support payments are processed through the State Disbursement Unit and who does not establish and designate an account for the receipt of such payments by electronic funds transfer. Deposits to such account shall be limited to such support payments and accessible solely by means of a debit card that may be used to make purchases at participating retail outlets and obtain cash at automated teller machines. Any fees incurred for the use of such debit card, other than fees prohibited by this subsection or by agreement between the commissioner and the financial institution implementing the debit account, shall be the sole responsibility of the recipient of support payments for whom such account was established.\n\n(3) No debit card system authorized under subdivision (2) of this subsection shall be implemented, and no contract to implement such system may be entered into by the commissioner, unless such system or contract provides that the financial institution holding the debit account: (A) Imposes no charges to recipients of support payments for use of the debit card at (i) a point of sale terminal, or (ii) an automated teller machine, including an automated teller machine outside of the financial institution's network, for withdrawals from the account up to the maximum number of withdrawals specified in such contract; (B) assures the availability of a substantial number of in-network automated teller machines in all regions of the state in accordance with subparagraph (A) of this subdivision; (C) provides the recipient, without fee: (i) An adequate mechanism for promptly determining on and after the date a deposit is made that a deposit has been received and credited to the recipient's account, and (ii) account balance information by telephone or on the financial institution's Internet web site; (D) provides the recipient, without fee, regular written monthly account transaction statements which, at the recipient's option, may be received by mail or on the financial institution's Internet web site; (E) provides to recipient accounts the full protections of Regulation E of the Federal Reserve Board, 12 CFR Part 205, as from time to time amended; (F) to the extent that fees are permitted, prohibits the assessment of fees against recipients that are not assessed by the financial institution against other users of debit cards; and (G) provides customer service to recipients in languages other than English.\n\n(4) The commissioner, or the financial institution if such contract so requires, shall provide the recipient with a notice at the initial issuance of the debit card and at least annually thereafter that conforms to the requirements specified in this subdivision and is limited to the type of debit card account authorized by subdivision (2) of this subsection. The notice shall be in plain language and in an easily readable and understandable format and shall identify (A) all service and penalty fees and their amounts; (B) the procedure for reporting and replacing a lost or stolen debit card and the allocation of liability for its unauthorized use; (C) the procedure for reporting account errors and the allocation of liability for such errors; (D) the procedure for obtaining funds when a debit card is lost or stolen; (E) the possibility, if any, of overdrafts; and (F) other similar consumer information.\n\n(k) Investigators employed by the Department of Social Services shall, pursuant to authority granted to such investigators by the commissioner, make service of any summons, subpoena or citation in IV-D support cases in the Superior Court or in the Family Support Magistrate Division. Investigators at the time of service shall coordinate with the clerk of the Superior Court and the assistant clerk of the Family Support Magistrate Division in setting a date for appearance before the court. When serving process issued by such court, the date for such appearance before the court shall be not less than twelve days from the date of service.\n\n(l) The Office of Child Support Services shall arrange to provide a single centralized automated system for the reporting of collections on all accounts established for the collection of all IV-D support orders. Such reporting shall be made available to the Family Support Magistrate Division and to all state agencies which have a cooperative agreement with the IV-D agency. Such automated system shall include a state case registry which complies with federal law and regulations. The state case registry shall contain information on each support order established or modified in this state.\n\n(m) The Commissioner of Social Services shall adopt regulations, in accordance with the provisions of chapter 54, which shall establish performance standards to address the mandatory provisions of both state and federal laws and federal regulations concerning child support as well as establish additional standards that may be deemed necessary in order to enhance child support enforcement.\n\n(n) Each year, on or before April first, the IV-D agency, in accordance with section 11-4a , shall submit to the joint standing committees of the General Assembly having cognizance of matters relating to the judiciary and human services an assessment report on the administration and performance of the child support enforcement program during the preceding federal fiscal year. Such report may be submitted in electronic form."

The standard of assistance paid for individuals residing in rated boarding facilities shall remain at the level in effect on August 31, 2003. No person shall be eligible for cash assistance under the program if eligible for cash assistance under any other state or federal cash assistance program. The standards of assistance set forth in this subsection shall be subject to annual increases, as described in subsection (b) of section 17b-104 .",

In determining eligibility, the commissioner shall not consider as income (A) Aid and Attendance pension benefits granted to a veteran, as defined in section 27-103 , or the surviving spouse of such veteran; and (B) any tax refund or advance payment with respect to a refundable credit to the same extent such refund or advance payment would be disregarded under 26 USC 6409 in any federal program or state or local program financed in whole or in part with federal funds.

Such payment shall be equivalent to that which such victim would be entitled to receive as diversion assistance if such victim and his or her family, if any, were eligible for diversion assistance. In determining whether and in what amount a victim of domestic violence and his or her family are eligible for a one-time assistance payment pursuant to this subsection, the commissioner shall not include as a member of such victim's family the spouse, domestic partner or other household member credibly accused of domestic violence by such victim, nor shall the commissioner count the income or assets of such a spouse, domestic partner or other household member. For purposes of this subsection, allegations of domestic violence may be substantiated by the commissioner pursuant to the provisions of subsection (b) of section 17b-112a , and “family” has the same meaning as used in section 17b-112 , except as otherwise provided in this subsection."

Notwithstanding any provision of the general statutes, on and after October 1, 2003, no town shall be reimbursed by the state for any general assistance medical benefits incurred after September 30, 2003, and on and after March 1, 2004, no town shall be reimbursed by the state for any general assistance cash benefits or general assistance program administrative costs incurred after February 29, 2004.\n\n(b) The state-administered general assistance program shall provide cash assistance of (1) two hundred dollars per month for an unemployable person upon determination of such person's unemployability; (2) two hundred dollars per month for a transitional person who is required to pay for shelter; and (3) fifty dollars per month for a transitional person who is not required to pay for shelter. The standard of assistance paid for individuals residing in rated boarding facilities shall remain at the level in effect on August 31, 2003. No person shall be eligible for cash assistance under the program if eligible for cash assistance under any other state or federal cash assistance program. The standards of assistance set forth in this subsection shall be subject to annual increases, as described in subsection (b) of section 17b-104 .\n\n(c) To be eligible for cash assistance under the program, a person shall (1) be (A) eighteen years of age or older; (B) a minor found by a court to be emancipated pursuant to section 46b-150 ; or (C) under eighteen years of age and the commissioner determines good cause for such person's eligibility, and (2) not have assets exceeding five hundred dollars or, if such person is married, such person and his or her spouse shall not have assets exceeding one thousand dollars. In determining eligibility, the commissioner shall not consider as income (A) Aid and Attendance pension benefits granted to a veteran, as defined in section 27-103 , or the surviving spouse of such veteran; and (B) any tax refund or advance payment with respect to a refundable credit to the same extent such refund or advance payment would be disregarded under 26 USC 6409 in any federal program or state or local program financed in whole or in part with federal funds. No person who is a substance abuser and refuses or fails to enter available, appropriate treatment shall be eligible for cash assistance under the program until such person enters treatment. No person whose benefits from the temporary family assistance program have terminated as a result of time-limited benefits or for failure to comply with a program requirement shall be eligible for cash assistance under the program.\n\n(d) Prior to or upon discontinuance of assistance, a person previously determined to be a transitional person may petition the commissioner to review the determination of his or her status. In such review, the commissioner shall consider factors, including, but not limited to: (1) Age; (2) education; (3) vocational training; (4) mental and physical health; and (5) employment history and shall make a determination of such person's ability to obtain gainful employment.\n\n(e) Notwithstanding any other provision of this section or section 17b-194 , a victim of domestic violence, as defined in section 17b-112a , who is not eligible for diversion assistance under the provisions of section 17b-112g , shall be eligible for a one-time assistance payment under the state-administered general assistance program within resources available to the Department of Social Services. Such payment shall be equivalent to that which such victim would be entitled to receive as diversion assistance if such victim and his or her family, if any, were eligible for diversion assistance. In determining whether and in what amount a victim of domestic violence and his or her family are eligible for a one-time assistance payment pursuant to this subsection, the commissioner shall not include as a member of such victim's family the spouse, domestic partner or other household member credibly accused of domestic violence by such victim, nor shall the commissioner count the income or assets of such a spouse, domestic partner or other household member. For purposes of this subsection, allegations of domestic violence may be substantiated by the commissioner pursuant to the provisions of subsection (b) of section 17b-112a , and “family” has the same meaning as used in section 17b-112 , except as otherwise provided in this subsection."

Such cost for the care of persons in facilities operated by the Department of Mental Health and Addiction Services shall be determined by the Comptroller, in consultation with the Commissioner of Mental Health and Addiction Services, on a facility-wide, ward-wide or unit-wide basis. The provisions of this section shall not apply to cases eligible for medical assistance or public assistance under Title XVIII or Title XIX of the Social Security Act, and such cases shall be administered as medical or public assistance cases and shall be subject to federal and state law, rules and procedures governing the same.\n\n(b) The maximum rate to be charged for the support of each patient for the ensuing year shall be the per capita cost. The commissioner shall, upon the admission of each patient to a humane institution, and may, upon any subsequent readmission of such patient, cause an investigation to be made of the financial circumstances of each liable person and the estate of each patient and, if any such person or estate is found unable to pay the per capita cost, shall bill such liable person or estate from the date of admission at a rate which he finds such person or estate able to pay, provided the total billing to all persons responsible for the support of any patient, including the patient or patient's estate, shall be based on actual days of attendance at the facility involved and shall not exceed the per capita cost. A complete disclosure for the amount and terms of such monthly billing and continuing liability for costs associated with services provided by the state shall be provided to such liable person or patient prior to admission or if the immediate need or admission precludes such notification, at the earliest possibility thereafter.\n\n(c) Each patient, the husband or wife of such patient and the father and mother of a patient under the age of eighteen years each shall be legally liable from the date of admission for the support of such patient in such institution in accordance with his ability to pay; except that the maximum liability of legally liable relatives as such for a patient in a state humane institution shall be determined by the commissioner in accordance with section 4a-12 and subsection (b) of this section. The guardian, conservator and payee of Social Security or other benefits on behalf of any such patient shall be similarly responsible for the support of such patient, but shall be liable in such capacity only in accordance with the amount of the patient's estate or the benefits received, or both, as the case may be. Said commissioner may bill and accept payment from any other person or agency willing to assume any portion of the cost of support of a person in a state humane institution at such rate as such person or agency is willing to pay. The relatives of any such patient who is a veteran shall not be liable as such for any part of the cost of his care in such institution.\n\n(d) Wherever a rate of billing has been established as the result of a fraud of the patient or a liable person, or where assets of the patient or relative have been concealed so as not to be available to civil process, such patient or liable person, as the case may be, shall be liable for the difference between the amounts actually billed and paid and the amount which would have been billed against such patient or liable person except for such fraud or concealment, which difference may be recovered in a civil action in the same manner as is provided in section 17b-228 , together with interest at the rate of twelve per cent from the date of such billing, and no statute of limitations shall apply to such right of action.\n\nSee Sec. 17a-461 re charges for care in Connecticut Mental Health Center.\n\nSee Sec. 19a-257 re support of patients with chronic illness excluding tuberculosis."

The commissioner shall, in accordance with the provisions of section 11-4a , file a report on the results of the fiscal analysis not later than six months after implementing the rate payment system with the joint standing committees of the General Assembly having cognizance of matters relating to human services and appropriations and the budgets of state agencies. Within available appropriations, the commissioner shall annually determine in-patient payments for each hospital by multiplying diagnosis-related group relative weights by a base rate. Over a period of up to four years beginning on or after January 1, 2016, within available appropriations and at the discretion of the commissioner, the Department of Social Services shall transition hospital-specific, diagnosis-related group base rates to state-wide diagnosis-related group base rates by peer groups determined by the commissioner. For the purposes of this subsection and subsection (c) of this section, “peer group” means a group comprised of one of the following categories of acute care hospitals: Privately operated acute care hospitals, publicly operated acute care hospitals, or acute care children's hospitals licensed by the Department of Public Health. At the discretion of the Commissioner of Social Services, the peer group for privately operated acute care hospitals may be further subdivided into peer groups for privately operated acute care hospitals. For inpatient hospital services that the Commissioner of Social Services determines are not appropriate for reimbursement based on diagnosis-related groups, the commissioner shall reimburse for such services using any other methodology that complies with 42 USC 1396a(a)(30)(A). Within available appropriations, the commissioner may, in his or her discretion, make additional payments to hospitals based on criteria to be determined by the commissioner. Upon the conversion to a hospital payment methodology based on diagnosis-related groups, the commissioner shall evaluate payments for all hospital services, including, but not limited to, a review of pediatric psychiatric inpatient units within hospitals. The commissioner may, within available appropriations, implement a pay-for-performance program for pediatric psychiatric inpatient care. Nothing contained in this section shall authorize Medicaid payment by the state to any such hospital in excess of the charges made by such hospital for comparable services to the general public.",

Such ambulatory payment classification system may include one or more peer groups established by the Department of Social Services. The Commissioner of Social Services shall, in accordance with the provisions of section 11-4a , file a report on the results of the fiscal analysis not later than six months after implementing the rate payment system with the joint standing committees of the General Assembly having cognizance of matters relating to human services and appropriations and the budgets of state agencies. Nothing contained in this subsection shall authorize a payment by the state for such services to any hospital in excess of the charges made by such hospital for comparable services to the general public. Effective upon implementation of the ambulatory payment classification system, a covered outpatient hospital service that is not being reimbursed using such ambulatory payment classification system shall be paid in accordance with a fee schedule or an alternative payment methodology, as determined by the commissioner. The commissioner may, within available funding for implementation of the ambulatory payment classification methodology, establish a supplemental pool to provide payments to offset losses incurred, if any, by publicly operated acute care hospitals and acute care children's hospitals licensed by the Department of Public Health as a result of the implementation of the ambulatory payment classification system.

              "(5) Nothing in this section shall affect the authority of the state to recover overpayments and collect unpaid liabilities, as authorized by law. No provision of this subsection shall affect implementation of state-wide diagnosis-related group base rates in accordance with subsection (a) of this section.",
              "(j) Except as otherwise specifically required in subsection (i) of this section, (1) notwithstanding the provisions of this chapter or regulations adopted thereunder, the Department of Social Services is not required to increase rates paid, or to set any rates to be paid to or adjust upward any method of payment to, any hospital based on inflation or based on any inflationary factor, including, but not limited to, any current payments or adjustments that are being made based on dates of service in previous years, and (2) the Department of Social Services shall not increase or adjust upward any rates or method of payment to hospitals based on inflation or based on any inflationary factor unless the approved state budget includes appropriations for such increases or upward adjustments.",

            "text": "(a) Medicaid rates paid to acute care hospitals, including children's hospitals, shall be based on diagnosis-related groups established and periodically rebased by the Commissioner of Social Services in accordance with 42 USC 1396a(a)(30)(A), provided the Department of Social Services completes a fiscal analysis of the impact of such rate payment system on each hospital. The commissioner shall, in accordance with the provisions of section 11-4a , file a report on the results of the fiscal analysis not later than six months after implementing the rate payment system with the joint standing committees of the General Assembly having cognizance of matters relating to human services and appropriations and the budgets of state agencies. Within available appropriations, the commissioner shall annually determine in-patient payments for each hospital by multiplying diagnosis-related group relative weights by a base rate. Over a period of up to four years beginning on or after January 1, 2016, within available appropriations and at the discretion of the commissioner, the Department of Social Services shall transition hospital-specific, diagnosis-related group base rates to state-wide diagnosis-related group base rates by peer groups determined by the commissioner. For the purposes of this subsection and subsection (c) of this section, “peer group” means a group comprised of one of the following categories of acute care hospitals: Privately operated acute care hospitals, publicly operated acute care hospitals, or acute care children's hospitals licensed by the Department of Public Health. At the discretion of the Commissioner of Social Services, the peer group for privately operated acute care hospitals may be further subdivided into peer groups for privately operated acute care hospitals. For inpatient hospital services that the Commissioner of Social Services determines are not appropriate for reimbursement based on diagnosis-related groups, the commissioner shall reimburse for such services using any other methodology that complies with 42 USC 1396a(a)(30)(A). Within available appropriations, the commissioner may, in his or her discretion, make additional payments to hospitals based on criteria to be determined by the commissioner. Upon the conversion to a hospital payment methodology based on diagnosis-related groups, the commissioner shall evaluate payments for all hospital services, including, but not limited to, a review of pediatric psychiatric inpatient units within hospitals. The commissioner may, within available appropriations, implement a pay-for-performance program for pediatric psychiatric inpatient care. Nothing contained in this section shall authorize Medicaid payment by the state to any such hospital in excess of the charges made by such hospital for comparable services to the general public.\n\n(b) Effective October 1, 1991, the rate to be paid by the state for the cost of special services rendered by such hospitals shall be established annually by the commissioner for each such hospital pursuant to 42 USC 1396a(a)(30)(A) and within available appropriations. Nothing contained in this subsection shall authorize a payment by the state for such services to any such hospital in excess of the charges made by such hospital for comparable services to the general public.\n\n(c) (1) Until such time as subdivision (2) of this subsection is effective, the state shall also pay to such hospitals for each outpatient clinic and emergency room visit a rate established by the commissioner for each hospital pursuant to 42 USC 1396a(a)(30)(A) and within available appropriations.\n\n(2) On or after July 1, 2016, with the exception of publicly operated psychiatric hospitals, hospitals shall be paid for outpatient and emergency room services based on prospective rates established by the commissioner within available appropriations and in accordance with an ambulatory payment classification system, provided the Department of Social Services completes a fiscal analysis of the impact of such rate payment system on each hospital. Such ambulatory payment classification system may include one or more peer groups established by the Department of Social Services. The Commissioner of Social Services shall, in accordance with the provisions of section 11-4a , file a report on the results of the fiscal analysis not later than six months after implementing the rate payment system with the joint standing committees of the General Assembly having cognizance of matters relating to human services and appropriations and the budgets of state agencies. Nothing contained in this subsection shall authorize a payment by the state for such services to any hospital in excess of the charges made by such hospital for comparable services to the general public. Effective upon implementation of the ambulatory payment classification system, a covered outpatient hospital service that is not being reimbursed using such ambulatory payment classification system shall be paid in accordance with a fee schedule or an alternative payment methodology, as determined by the commissioner. The commissioner may, within available funding for implementation of the ambulatory payment classification methodology, establish a supplemental pool to provide payments to offset losses incurred, if any, by publicly operated acute care hospitals and acute care children's hospitals licensed by the Department of Public Health as a result of the implementation of the ambulatory payment classification system. Prior to the implementation of the ambulatory payment classification system, each hospital's charges shall be based on the charge master in effect as of June 1, 2015. After implementation of such system, annual increases in each hospital's charge master shall not exceed, in the aggregate, the annual increase in the Medicare economic index.\n\n(d) Concurrent with the implementation of the ambulatory payment classification methodology of payment to hospitals, an emergency department physician may enroll separately as a Medicaid provider and qualify for direct reimbursement for professional services provided in the emergency department of a hospital to a Medicaid recipient, including services provided on the same day the Medicaid recipient is admitted to the hospital. The commissioner shall pay to any such emergency department physician the Medicaid rate for physicians in accordance with the applicable physician fee schedule in effect at that time. If the commissioner determines that payment to an emergency department physician pursuant to this subsection results in an additional cost to the state, the commissioner shall adjust such rate in consultation with the Connecticut Hospital Association and the Connecticut College of Emergency Physicians to ensure budget neutrality.\n\n(e) The commissioner may adopt regulations, in accordance with the provisions of chapter 54, establishing criteria for defining emergency and nonemergency visits to hospital emergency rooms. All nonemergency visits to hospital emergency rooms shall be paid in accordance with subsection (c) of this section. Nothing contained in this subsection or the regulations adopted under this section shall authorize a payment by the state for such services to any hospital in excess of the charges made by such hospital for comparable services to the general public. To the extent permitted by federal law, the Commissioner of Social Services may impose cost-sharing requirements under the medical assistance program for nonemergency use of hospital emergency room services.\n\n(f) The commissioner shall establish rates to be paid to freestanding chronic disease hospitals within available appropriations.\n\n(g) The Commissioner of Social Services may implement policies and procedures as necessary to carry out the provisions of this section while in the process of adopting the policies and procedures as regulations, provided notice of intent to adopt the regulations is published in accordance with the provisions of section 17b-10 not later than twenty days after the date of implementation.\n\n(h) In the event the commissioner is unable to implement the provisions of subsection (d) of this section by January 1, 2015, the commissioner shall submit written notice, not later than thirty-five days prior to January 1, 2015, to the joint standing committees of the General Assembly having cognizance of matters relating to human services and appropriations and the budgets of state agencies indicating that the department will not be able to implement such provisions on or before such date. The commissioner shall include in such notice (1) the reasons why the department will not be able to implement such provisions by such date, and (2) the date by which the department will be able to implement such provisions.\n\n(i) (1) Subject to federal approval, the commissioner shall increase rates effective January 1, 2018, for hospitals, implementing those increases on the earliest available date, as follows: (A) The diagnosis-related group base rate for inpatient hospital services provided by nongovernmental licensed short-term general hospitals shall be increased by thirty-one and sixty-five-hundredths per cent from the level in effect on July 1, 2017, and (B) the ambulatory payment classification base conversion factor for outpatient hospital services provided by licensed short-term general hospitals shall be increased by six and one-half per cent from the level in effect on July 1, 2017.\n\n(2) (A) For the purposes of this subsection and subsection (k) of this section, “settlement agreement” has the same meaning as provided in section 12-263z .\n\n(B) To the extent required by the settlement agreement, including any court order issued in accordance with the provisions of section 12-263z , for dates of service from January 1, 2020, through June 30, 2026, applicable payments to nongovernmental licensed short-term general hospitals located in the state shall be made in accordance with the relevant requirements of said agreement regarding wage index values, the inpatient hospital all-patient refined diagnosis-related group base rate and the outpatient hospital ambulatory payment classification conversion factor.\n\n(3) (A) To the extent required by the settlement agreement, including any court order issued in accordance with the provisions of section 12-263z , effective January 1, 2020, and each January first thereafter until and including January 1, 2026, the commissioner shall increase annually the Medicaid rates payable to nongovernmental licensed short-term general hospitals located in the state as follows: (i) The inpatient hospital all-patient refined diagnosis-related group base rate by two per cent; (ii) the inpatient hospital behavioral health per diem rate, the inpatient psychiatric services and rehabilitation per diem rates and the inpatient behavioral health child discharge delay per diem rate, each by two per cent; (iii) the outpatient hospital ambulatory payment classification conversion factor by two and two-tenths per cent; and (iv) the revenue center codes listed on the hospital outpatient flat fee schedule by two and two-tenths per cent. Each such annual increase shall be calculated against the rates in effect for the calendar year immediately preceding such rate increase.\n\n(B) As soon as practicable after December 19, 2019, the commissioner shall publish public notice of the intent to submit the Medicaid state plan amendments necessary to provide for the rate increases set forth in subparagraph (A) of this subdivision. Not later than fifteen days after the expiration of the thirty-day comment period for such state plan amendments, the commissioner shall submit such state plan amendments to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services for approval. The commissioner shall diligently pursue the federal approvals required for such rate increases. The commissioner shall implement such rate increases for the dates of service set forth in subparagraph (A) of this subdivision even if federal approvals are received after such dates of service, provided the implementation of such rate increases remains subject to federal approval to the extent required by the terms of the settlement agreement, including any court order issued in accordance with the provisions of section 12-263z . If federal approvals of such rate increases are not obtained, the payment of such rate increases may later be recovered by the commissioner by recoupment against other Medicaid payments due to a hospital or in any manner authorized by law.\n\n(4) To the extent required by the settlement agreement, including any court order issued in accordance with the provisions of section 12-263z , from July 1, 2019, through June 30, 2026, the commissioner shall not remove, repeal or reduce the rate increases set forth in this subsection and appropriations for any payments to nongovernmental licensed short-term general hospitals based on such rates shall not be subject to rescissions or holdbacks.\n\n(5) Nothing in this section shall affect the authority of the state to recover overpayments and collect unpaid liabilities, as authorized by law. No provision of this subsection shall affect implementation of state-wide diagnosis-related group base rates in accordance with subsection (a) of this section.\n\n(j) Except as otherwise specifically required in subsection (i) of this section, (1) notwithstanding the provisions of this chapter or regulations adopted thereunder, the Department of Social Services is not required to increase rates paid, or to set any rates to be paid to or adjust upward any method of payment to, any hospital based on inflation or based on any inflationary factor, including, but not limited to, any current payments or adjustments that are being made based on dates of service in previous years, and (2) the Department of Social Services shall not increase or adjust upward any rates or method of payment to hospitals based on inflation or based on any inflationary factor unless the approved state budget includes appropriations for such increases or upward adjustments.\n\n(k) (1) Subject to any court order issued in accordance with the provisions of section 12-263z , the Department of Social Services shall make payments to nongovernmental licensed short-term general hospitals to the extent required by the settlement agreement, including, to the extent applicable, portions of payments for which the federal financial participation may not be available, such as one-time payments and payments using state-only funds above the upper payment limit. For the purposes of this subsection, “upper payment limit” means the limit on aggregate Medicaid payments to specified groups of facilities for which Medicaid federal financial participation is available, in accordance with 42 CFR 447.72 and 42 CFR 447.321, as applicable, each as amended from time to time.\n\n(2) To the extent required by the settlement agreement, including any court order issued in accordance with the provisions of section 12-263z , from July 1, 2019, through June 30, 2026, for nongovernmental licensed short-term general hospitals located in the state, the Department of Social Services shall continue to set Medicaid rates for inpatient hospital services and outpatient hospital services in accordance with the rate-setting rules and methodologies established in the Medicaid state plan in effect as of December 19, 2019, and incorporating changes to said plan as required by the settlement agreement."

Such pools shall include, but not be limited to, as applicable, general, small hospital, mid-sized hospital and large hospital supplemental pools.\n\n(c) (1) The department shall distribute supplemental payments to applicable hospitals in accordance with the settlement agreement, including any court order issued in accordance with the provisions of section 12-263z . The commissioner shall diligently pursue the federal approvals required for the supplemental pools and payments set forth in this section.\n\n(2) To the extent required by the settlement agreement, including any court order issued in accordance with the provisions of section 12-263z , the Department of Social Services shall pay Medicaid supplemental payments to nongovernmental licensed short-term general hospitals located in the state as follows: (A) For the fiscal years ending June 30, 2020, and June 30, 2021, five hundred forty-eight million three hundred thousand dollars in each such fiscal year; and (B) for the fiscal years ending June 30, 2022, through June 30, 2026, five hundred sixty-eight million three hundred thousand dollars in each such fiscal year. For fiscal years commencing on and after July 1, 2026, the total amount of supplemental payments paid to such hospitals shall continue at the level in effect for the prior fiscal year unless modified through any provision of the general statutes or appropriations act.\n\n(3) From July 1, 2019, through June 30, 2026, the Department of Social Services shall make supplemental payments to the applicable hospitals on or before the last day of the first month of each calendar quarter, except that payments scheduled to be made before December 19, 2019, shall be made not later than thirty days after December 19, 2019.\n\n(4) If a nongovernmental licensed short-term general hospital located in the state merges or consolidates with or is acquired by another hospital, such that the hospital does not continue to maintain a separate short-term general hospital license, the supplemental payments that would have been paid to the hospital that no longer maintains such license shall be paid instead to the surviving hospital, beginning with the first calendar quarter that commences on or after the effective date of the merger, consolidation or acquisition. If a nongovernmental licensed short-term general hospital located in the state dissolves, ceases to operate or otherwise terminates licensed short-term general hospital services, the supplemental payments that would have been paid to such hospital shall not be paid to any other hospital for the remainder of the fiscal year in which such hospital dissolves, ceases operations or otherwise terminates such services. Commencing with the fiscal year after the hospital dissolved, ceased to operate or otherwise terminated such services, the supplemental payments that would have been made to such hospital shall be redistributed to all other nongovernmental licensed short-term general hospitals located in the state in accordance with the distribution methodology set forth in the settlement agreement for each supplemental pool.\n\n(5) Both the state and federal share of supplemental payments set forth in this subsection shall be appropriated to the Department of Social Services.

Such reconciliation shall ensure that, after accounting for such payment adjustments, the actual supplemental payments made to each hospital shall be the amounts due to each hospital pursuant to the settlement agreement, even if federal approvals are received after each applicable date that supplemental payments are required to be made, provided the supplemental payments remain subject to federal approval. If federal approval of such payments is not obtained, such payments may later be recovered by the commissioner by recoupment against other Medicaid payments due to a hospital or in any manner authorized by law."

The Commissioner of Social Services shall establish a fee schedule for home health services to be effective on and after July 1, 1994. The commissioner may annually modify such fee schedule if such modification is needed to ensure that the conversion to an administrative services organization is cost neutral to home health care agencies and home health aide agencies in the aggregate and ensures patient access. Utilization may be a factor in determining cost neutrality. The commissioner shall increase the fee schedule for home health services provided under the Connecticut home-care program for the elderly established under section 17b-342 , effective July 1, 2000, by two per cent over the fee schedule for home health services for the previous year. On and after January 1, 2024, the commissioner shall increase the fee schedule for complex care nursing services provided to individuals over the age of eighteen such that the rate of reimbursement is equal to the rate for such services provided to individuals age eighteen and under.

The commissioner may increase any fee payable to a home health care agency or home health aide agency upon the application of such an agency evidencing extraordinary costs related to (1) serving persons with AIDS; (2) high-risk maternal and child health care; (3) escort services; or (4) extended hour services. In no case shall any rate or fee exceed the charge to the general public for similar services. A home health care agency or home health aide agency which, due to any material change in circumstances, is aggrieved by a rate determined pursuant to this subsection may, within ten days of receipt of written notice of such rate from the Commissioner of Social Services, request in writing a hearing on all items of aggrievement. The commissioner shall, upon the receipt of all documentation necessary to evaluate the request, determine whether there has been such a change in circumstances and shall conduct a hearing if appropriate. The Commissioner of Social Services shall adopt regulations, in accordance with chapter 54, to implement the provisions of this subsection. The commissioner may implement policies and procedures to carry out the provisions of this subsection while in the process of adopting regulations, provided notice of intent to adopt the regulations is posted on the eRegulations System not later than twenty days after the date of implementing the policies and procedures.

Administration of medication may include, but is not limited to, blood pressure checks, glucometer readings, pulse rate checks and similar indicators of health status. The fee for medication administration shall include administration of medications while the nurse is present, the pre-pouring of additional doses that the client will self-administer at a later time and the teaching of self-administration. The department shall not pay for medication administration in addition to any other nursing service at the same visit. The department may establish prior authorization requirements for this service. Before implementing such change, the Commissioner of Social Services shall consult with the chairpersons of the joint standing committees of the General Assembly having cognizance of matters relating to public health and human services. The commissioner shall monitor Medicaid home health care savings achieved through the implementation of nurse delegation of medication administration pursuant to section 19a-492e . If, by January 1, 2016, the commissioner determines that the rate of savings is not adequate to meet the annualized savings assumed in the budget for the biennium ending June 30, 2017, the department may reduce rates for medication administration as necessary to achieve the savings assumed in the budget. Prior to any rate reduction, the department shall report to the joint standing committees of the General Assembly having cognizance of matters relating to appropriations and the budgets of state agencies and human services provider specific cost and utilization trend data for those patients receiving medication administration. Should the department determine it necessary to reduce medication administration rates under this section, it shall examine the possibility of establishing a separate Medicaid supplemental rate or a pay-for-performance program for those providers, as determined by the commissioner, who have established successful nurse delegation programs.",

              "(f) If the electronic record or signature that has been transmitted to a home health care agency or home health aide agency is illegible or the department is unable to determine the validity of such electronic record or signature, the department shall review additional evidence of the accuracy or validity of the record or signature, including, but not limited to, (1) the original of the record or signature, or (2) a written statement, made under penalty of false statement, from (A) the licensed physician or licensed practitioner of a health care profession who signed such record, or (B) if such licensed physician or licensed practitioner of a health care profession is unavailable, the medical director of the agency verifying the accuracy or validity of such record or signature, and the department shall make a determination whether the electronic record or signature is valid.",

Nothing in this subsection shall be construed as limiting the powers of the Commissioner of Public Health to enforce the provisions of sections 19-13-D73 and 19-13-D74 of the regulations of Connecticut state agencies and 42 CFR 484.18(c).",

            "text": "(a) The Department of Social Services shall determine the rates to be paid to home health care agencies and home health aide agencies by the state or any town in the state for persons aided or cared for by the state or any such town. The Commissioner of Social Services shall establish a fee schedule for home health services to be effective on and after July 1, 1994. The commissioner may annually modify such fee schedule if such modification is needed to ensure that the conversion to an administrative services organization is cost neutral to home health care agencies and home health aide agencies in the aggregate and ensures patient access. Utilization may be a factor in determining cost neutrality. The commissioner shall increase the fee schedule for home health services provided under the Connecticut home-care program for the elderly established under section 17b-342 , effective July 1, 2000, by two per cent over the fee schedule for home health services for the previous year. On and after January 1, 2024, the commissioner shall increase the fee schedule for complex care nursing services provided to individuals over the age of eighteen such that the rate of reimbursement is equal to the rate for such services provided to individuals age eighteen and under. There shall be no differential in fees paid for such services based on the age of the patient. The commissioner may increase any fee payable to a home health care agency or home health aide agency upon the application of such an agency evidencing extraordinary costs related to (1) serving persons with AIDS; (2) high-risk maternal and child health care; (3) escort services; or (4) extended hour services. In no case shall any rate or fee exceed the charge to the general public for similar services. A home health care agency or home health aide agency which, due to any material change in circumstances, is aggrieved by a rate determined pursuant to this subsection may, within ten days of receipt of written notice of such rate from the Commissioner of Social Services, request in writing a hearing on all items of aggrievement. The commissioner shall, upon the receipt of all documentation necessary to evaluate the request, determine whether there has been such a change in circumstances and shall conduct a hearing if appropriate. The Commissioner of Social Services shall adopt regulations, in accordance with chapter 54, to implement the provisions of this subsection. The commissioner may implement policies and procedures to carry out the provisions of this subsection while in the process of adopting regulations, provided notice of intent to adopt the regulations is posted on the eRegulations System not later than twenty days after the date of implementing the policies and procedures. Such policies and procedures shall be valid for not longer than nine months. For purposes of this subsection, “complex care nursing services” means intensive, specialized nursing services provided to a patient with complex care needs who requires skilled nursing care at home.\n\n(b) The Department of Social Services shall monitor the rates charged by home health care agencies and home health aide agencies. Such agencies shall file annual cost reports and service charge information with the department.\n\n(c) The home health services fee schedule shall include a fee for the administration of medication, which shall apply when the purpose of a nurse's visit is limited to the administration of medication. Administration of medication may include, but is not limited to, blood pressure checks, glucometer readings, pulse rate checks and similar indicators of health status. The fee for medication administration shall include administration of medications while the nurse is present, the pre-pouring of additional doses that the client will self-administer at a later time and the teaching of self-administration. The department shall not pay for medication administration in addition to any other nursing service at the same visit. The department may establish prior authorization requirements for this service. Before implementing such change, the Commissioner of Social Services shall consult with the chairpersons of the joint standing committees of the General Assembly having cognizance of matters relating to public health and human services. The commissioner shall monitor Medicaid home health care savings achieved through the implementation of nurse delegation of medication administration pursuant to section 19a-492e . If, by January 1, 2016, the commissioner determines that the rate of savings is not adequate to meet the annualized savings assumed in the budget for the biennium ending June 30, 2017, the department may reduce rates for medication administration as necessary to achieve the savings assumed in the budget. Prior to any rate reduction, the department shall report to the joint standing committees of the General Assembly having cognizance of matters relating to appropriations and the budgets of state agencies and human services provider specific cost and utilization trend data for those patients receiving medication administration. Should the department determine it necessary to reduce medication administration rates under this section, it shall examine the possibility of establishing a separate Medicaid supplemental rate or a pay-for-performance program for those providers, as determined by the commissioner, who have established successful nurse delegation programs.\n\n(d) The home health services fee schedule established pursuant to subsection (c) of this section shall include rates for psychiatric nurse visits.\n\n(e) The Department of Social Services, when processing or auditing claims for reimbursement submitted by home health care agencies and home health aide agencies shall, in accordance with the provisions of chapter 15, accept electronic records and records bearing the electronic signature of a licensed physician or licensed practitioner of a healthcare profession that has been submitted to the home health care agency or home health aide agency.\n\n(f) If the electronic record or signature that has been transmitted to a home health care agency or home health aide agency is illegible or the department is unable to determine the validity of such electronic record or signature, the department shall review additional evidence of the accuracy or validity of the record or signature, including, but not limited to, (1) the original of the record or signature, or (2) a written statement, made under penalty of false statement, from (A) the licensed physician or licensed practitioner of a health care profession who signed such record, or (B) if such licensed physician or licensed practitioner of a health care profession is unavailable, the medical director of the agency verifying the accuracy or validity of such record or signature, and the department shall make a determination whether the electronic record or signature is valid.\n\n(g) The Department of Social Services, when auditing claims submitted by home health care agencies and home health aide agencies, shall consider any signature from a licensed physician or licensed practitioner of a health care profession that may be required on a plan of care for home health services, to have been provided in timely fashion if (1) the document bearing such signature was signed prior to the time when such agency seeks reimbursement from the department for services provided, and (2) verbal or telephone orders from the licensed physician or licensed practitioner of a health care profession were received prior to the commencement of services covered by the plan of care and such orders were subsequently documented. Nothing in this subsection shall be construed as limiting the powers of the Commissioner of Public Health to enforce the provisions of sections 19-13-D73 and 19-13-D74 of the regulations of Connecticut state agencies and 42 CFR 484.18(c).\n\n(h) Any order for home health care services covered by the Department of Social Services may be issued by any licensed practitioner authorized to issue such an order pursuant to section 19a-496a . Any Department of Social Services regulation, policy or procedure that applies to a physician who orders such home health care services, including related provisions such as review and approval of care plans for home health care services, shall apply to any licensed practitioner authorized to order such home health care services pursuant to section 19a-496a .\n\n(i) For purposes of this section, “licensed practitioner of a healthcare profession” has the same meaning as “licensed practitioner” in section 21a-244a ."

              "(a) Medical assistance shall be provided for any otherwise eligible person (1) whose income, including any available support from legally liable relatives and the income of the person's spouse or dependent child, is not more than one hundred fifty-nine per cent, pending approval of a federal waiver applied for pursuant to subsection (e) of this section, of the benefit amount paid to a person with no income under the temporary family assistance program and (2) if such person is an institutionalized individual as defined in Section 1917 of the Social Security Act, 42 USC 1396p(h)(3), and has not made an assignment or transfer or other disposition of property for less than fair market value for the purpose of establishing eligibility for benefits or assistance under this section. Any such disposition shall be treated in accordance with Section 1917(c) of the Social Security Act, 42 USC 1396p(c). Any disposition of property made on behalf of an applicant or recipient or the spouse of an applicant or recipient by a guardian, conservator, person authorized to make such disposition pursuant to a power of attorney or other person so authorized by law shall be attributed to such applicant, recipient or spouse. A disposition of property ordered by a court shall be evaluated in accordance with the standards applied to any other such disposition for the purpose of determining eligibility. The commissioner shall establish the standards for eligibility for medical assistance at one hundred fifty-nine per cent of the benefit amount paid to a household of equal size with no income under the temporary family assistance program. In determining eligibility, the commissioner shall not consider as income Aid and Attendance pension benefits granted to a veteran, as defined in section 27-103 , or the surviving spouse of such veteran. Except as provided in section 17b-277 and section 17b-292 , the medical assistance program shall provide coverage to persons under the age of nineteen with household income up to one hundred ninety-six per cent of the federal poverty level without an asset limit and to persons under the age of nineteen, who qualify for coverage under Section 1931 of the Social Security Act, with household income not exceeding one hundred ninety-six per cent of the federal poverty level without an asset limit, and their parents and needy caretaker relatives, who qualify for coverage under Section 1931 of the Social Security Act, with household income not exceeding one hundred thirty-three per cent of the federal poverty level without an asset limit. Such levels shall be based on the regional differences in such benefit amount, if applicable, unless such levels based on regional differences are not in conformance with federal law. Any income in excess of the applicable amounts shall be applied as may be required by said federal law, and assistance shall be granted for the balance of the cost of authorized medical assistance. The Commissioner of Social Services shall provide applicants for assistance under this section, at the time of application, with a written statement advising them of (A) the effect of an assignment or transfer or other disposition of property on eligibility for benefits or assistance, (B) the effect that having income that exceeds the limits prescribed in this subsection will have with respect to program eligibility, and (C) the availability of, and eligibility for, services provided by the Connecticut Home Visiting System, established pursuant to section 17b-751b . For coverage dates on or after January 1, 2014, the department shall use the modified adjusted gross income financial eligibility rules set forth in Section 1902(e)(14) of the Social Security Act and the implementing regulations to determine eligibility for HUSKY A, HUSKY B and HUSKY D applicants, as defined in section 17b-290 . Persons who are determined ineligible for assistance pursuant to this section shall be provided a written statement notifying such persons of their ineligibility and advising such persons of their potential eligibility for one of the other insurance affordability programs as defined in 42 CFR 435.4.",
              "(b) For the purposes of the Medicaid program, the Commissioner of Social Services shall consider parental income and resources as available to a child under eighteen years of age who is living with his or her parents and is blind or disabled for purposes of the Medicaid program, or to any other child under twenty-one years of age who is living with his or her parents.",
              "(c) For the purposes of determining eligibility for the Medicaid program, an available asset is one that is actually available to the applicant or one that the applicant has the legal right, authority or power to obtain or to have applied for the applicant's general or medical support. If the terms of a trust provide for the support of an applicant, the refusal of a trustee to make a distribution from the trust does not render the trust an unavailable asset. Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection, the availability of funds in a trust or similar instrument funded in whole or in part by the applicant or the applicant's spouse shall be determined pursuant to the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993, 42 USC 1396p. The provisions of this subsection shall not apply to a special needs trust, as defined in 42 USC 1396p(d)(4)(A), as amended from time to time. For purposes of determining whether a beneficiary under a special needs trust, who has not received a disability determination from the Social Security Administration, is disabled, as defined in 42 USC 1382c(a)(3), the Commissioner of Social Services, or the commissioner's designee, shall independently make such determination. The commissioner shall not require such beneficiary to apply for Social Security disability benefits or obtain a disability determination from the Social Security Administration for purposes of determining whether the beneficiary is disabled.",
              "(d) The transfer of an asset in exchange for other valuable consideration shall be allowable to the extent the value of the other valuable consideration is equal to or greater than the value of the asset transferred.",
              "(e) The Commissioner of Social Services shall seek a waiver from federal law to permit federal financial participation for Medicaid expenditures for families with incomes of one hundred forty-three per cent of the temporary family assistance program payment standard.",
              "(f) To the extent permitted by federal law, Medicaid eligibility shall be extended for one year to a family that becomes ineligible for medical assistance under Section 1931 of the Social Security Act due to income from employment by one of its members who is a caretaker relative or due to receipt of child support income. A family receiving extended benefits on July 1, 2005, shall receive the balance of such extended benefits, provided no such family shall receive more than twelve additional months of such benefits.",
              "(g) An institutionalized spouse applying for Medicaid and having a spouse living in the community shall be required, to the maximum extent permitted by law, to divert income to such community spouse in order to raise the community spouse's income to the level of the minimum monthly needs allowance, as described in Section 1924 of the Social Security Act. Such diversion of income shall occur before the community spouse is allowed to retain assets in excess of the community spouse protected amount described in Section 1924 of the Social Security Act. The Commissioner of Social Services, pursuant to section 17b-10 , may implement the provisions of this subsection while in the process of adopting regulations, provided the commissioner prints notice of intent to adopt the regulations in the Connecticut Law Journal within twenty days of adopting such policy. Such policy shall be valid until the time final regulations are effective.",
              "(h) To the extent permissible under federal law, an institutionalized individual, as defined in Section 1917 of the Social Security Act, 42 USC 1396p(h)(3), shall not be determined ineligible for Medicaid solely on the basis of the cash value of a life insurance policy worth less than ten thousand dollars provided the individual is pursuing the surrender of the policy.",
              "(i) Medical assistance shall be provided, in accordance with the provisions of subsection (e) of section 17a-6 , to any child under the supervision of the Commissioner of Children and Families who is not receiving Medicaid benefits, has not yet qualified for Medicaid benefits or is otherwise ineligible for such benefits. Medical assistance shall also be provided to any child in the behavioral services program operated by the Department of Developmental Services who is not receiving Medicaid benefits, has not yet qualified for Medicaid benefits or is otherwise ineligible for benefits. To the extent practicable, the Commissioner of Children and Families and the Commissioner of Developmental Services shall apply for, or assist such child in qualifying for, the Medicaid program.",
              "(j) The Commissioner of Social Services shall provide Early and Periodic Screening, Diagnostic and Treatment program services, as required and defined as of December 31, 2005, by 42 USC 1396a(a)(43), 42 USC 1396d(r) and 42 USC 1396d(a)(4)(B) and applicable federal regulations, to all persons who are under the age of twenty-one and otherwise eligible for medical assistance under this section.",
              "(k) A veteran, as defined in section 27-103 , and any member of his or her family, who applies for or receives assistance under the Medicaid program, shall apply for all benefits for which he or she may be eligible through the United States Department of Veterans Affairs or the United States Department of Defense.",
              "(l) On and after January 1, 2023, and until June 30, 2024, the Commissioner of Social Services shall, within available appropriations, provide state-funded medical assistance to any child twelve years of age and younger, regardless of immigration status, (1) whose household income does not exceed two hundred one per cent of the federal poverty level without an asset limit, and (2) who does not otherwise qualify for Medicaid, the Children's Health Insurance Program, or an offer of affordable, employer-sponsored insurance, as defined in the Affordable Care Act, as an employee or a dependent of an employee. On and after July 1, 2024, the commissioner shall, within available appropriations, provide state-funded medical assistance to any child fifteen years of age and younger, regardless of immigration status, who qualifies pursuant to subdivisions (1) and (2) of this subsection. A child eligible for such assistance under this subsection shall continue to receive such assistance until such child is nineteen years of age, provided the child continues to meet the eligibility requirements prescribed in subdivisions (1) and (2) of this subsection. The provisions of section 17b-265 shall apply with respect to any medical assistance provided pursuant to this subsection."

Any such disposition shall be treated in accordance with Section 1917(c) of the Social Security Act, 42 USC 1396p(c). Any disposition of property made on behalf of an applicant or recipient or the spouse of an applicant or recipient by a guardian, conservator, person authorized to make such disposition pursuant to a power of attorney or other person so authorized by law shall be attributed to such applicant, recipient or spouse. A disposition of property ordered by a court shall be evaluated in accordance with the standards applied to any other such disposition for the purpose of determining eligibility. The commissioner shall establish the standards for eligibility for medical assistance at one hundred fifty-nine per cent of the benefit amount paid to a household of equal size with no income under the temporary family assistance program. In determining eligibility, the commissioner shall not consider as income Aid and Attendance pension benefits granted to a veteran, as defined in section 27-103 , or the surviving spouse of such veteran. Except as provided in section 17b-277 and section 17b-292 , the medical assistance program shall provide coverage to persons under the age of nineteen with household income up to one hundred ninety-six per cent of the federal poverty level without an asset limit and to persons under the age of nineteen, who qualify for coverage under Section 1931 of the Social Security Act, with household income not exceeding one hundred ninety-six per cent of the federal poverty level without an asset limit, and their parents and needy caretaker relatives, who qualify for coverage under Section 1931 of the Social Security Act, with household income not exceeding one hundred thirty-three per cent of the federal poverty level without an asset limit. Such levels shall be based on the regional differences in such benefit amount, if applicable, unless such levels based on regional differences are not in conformance with federal law. Any income in excess of the applicable amounts shall be applied as may be required by said federal law, and assistance shall be granted for the balance of the cost of authorized medical assistance. The Commissioner of Social Services shall provide applicants for assistance under this section, at the time of application, with a written statement advising them of (A) the effect of an assignment or transfer or other disposition of property on eligibility for benefits or assistance, (B) the effect that having income that exceeds the limits prescribed in this subsection will have with respect to program eligibility, and (C) the availability of, and eligibility for, services provided by the Connecticut Home Visiting System, established pursuant to section 17b-751b . For coverage dates on or after January 1, 2014, the department shall use the modified adjusted gross income financial eligibility rules set forth in Section 1902(e)(14) of the Social Security Act and the implementing regulations to determine eligibility for HUSKY A, HUSKY B and HUSKY D applicants, as defined in section 17b-290 . Persons who are determined ineligible for assistance pursuant to this section shall be provided a written statement notifying such persons of their ineligibility and advising such persons of their potential eligibility for one of the other insurance affordability programs as defined in 42 CFR 435.4.\n\n(b) For the purposes of the Medicaid program, the Commissioner of Social Services shall consider parental income and resources as available to a child under eighteen years of age who is living with his or her parents and is blind or disabled for purposes of the Medicaid program, or to any other child under twenty-one years of age who is living with his or her parents.\n\n(c) For the purposes of determining eligibility for the Medicaid program, an available asset is one that is actually available to the applicant or one that the applicant has the legal right, authority or power to obtain or to have applied for the applicant's general or medical support. If the terms of a trust provide for the support of an applicant, the refusal of a trustee to make a distribution from the trust does not render the trust an unavailable asset. Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection, the availability of funds in a trust or similar instrument funded in whole or in part by the applicant or the applicant's spouse shall be determined pursuant to the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993, 42 USC 1396p. The provisions of this subsection shall not apply to a special needs trust, as defined in 42 USC 1396p(d)(4)(A), as amended from time to time. For purposes of determining whether a beneficiary under a special needs trust, who has not received a disability determination from the Social Security Administration, is disabled, as defined in 42 USC 1382c(a)(3), the Commissioner of Social Services, or the commissioner's designee, shall independently make such determination. The commissioner shall not require such beneficiary to apply for Social Security disability benefits or obtain a disability determination from the Social Security Administration for purposes of determining whether the beneficiary is disabled.\n\n(d) The transfer of an asset in exchange for other valuable consideration shall be allowable to the extent the value of the other valuable consideration is equal to or greater than the value of the asset transferred.\n\n(e) The Commissioner of Social Services shall seek a waiver from federal law to permit federal financial participation for Medicaid expenditures for families with incomes of one hundred forty-three per cent of the temporary family assistance program payment standard.\n\n(f) To the extent permitted by federal law, Medicaid eligibility shall be extended for one year to a family that becomes ineligible for medical assistance under Section 1931 of the Social Security Act due to income from employment by one of its members who is a caretaker relative or due to receipt of child support income. A family receiving extended benefits on July 1, 2005, shall receive the balance of such extended benefits, provided no such family shall receive more than twelve additional months of such benefits.\n\n(g) An institutionalized spouse applying for Medicaid and having a spouse living in the community shall be required, to the maximum extent permitted by law, to divert income to such community spouse in order to raise the community spouse's income to the level of the minimum monthly needs allowance, as described in Section 1924 of the Social Security Act. Such diversion of income shall occur before the community spouse is allowed to retain assets in excess of the community spouse protected amount described in Section 1924 of the Social Security Act. The Commissioner of Social Services, pursuant to section 17b-10 , may implement the provisions of this subsection while in the process of adopting regulations, provided the commissioner prints notice of intent to adopt the regulations in the Connecticut Law Journal within twenty days of adopting such policy. Such policy shall be valid until the time final regulations are effective.\n\n(h) To the extent permissible under federal law, an institutionalized individual, as defined in Section 1917 of the Social Security Act, 42 USC 1396p(h)(3), shall not be determined ineligible for Medicaid solely on the basis of the cash value of a life insurance policy worth less than ten thousand dollars provided the individual is pursuing the surrender of the policy.\n\n(i) Medical assistance shall be provided, in accordance with the provisions of subsection (e) of section 17a-6 , to any child under the supervision of the Commissioner of Children and Families who is not receiving Medicaid benefits, has not yet qualified for Medicaid benefits or is otherwise ineligible for such benefits. Medical assistance shall also be provided to any child in the behavioral services program operated by the Department of Developmental Services who is not receiving Medicaid benefits, has not yet qualified for Medicaid benefits or is otherwise ineligible for benefits. To the extent practicable, the Commissioner of Children and Families and the Commissioner of Developmental Services shall apply for, or assist such child in qualifying for, the Medicaid program.\n\n(j) The Commissioner of Social Services shall provide Early and Periodic Screening, Diagnostic and Treatment program services, as required and defined as of December 31, 2005, by 42 USC 1396a(a)(43), 42 USC 1396d(r) and 42 USC 1396d(a)(4)(B) and applicable federal regulations, to all persons who are under the age of twenty-one and otherwise eligible for medical assistance under this section.\n\n(k) A veteran, as defined in section 27-103 , and any member of his or her family, who applies for or receives assistance under the Medicaid program, shall apply for all benefits for which he or she may be eligible through the United States Department of Veterans Affairs or the United States Department of Defense.\n\n(l) On and after January 1, 2023, and until June 30, 2024, the Commissioner of Social Services shall, within available appropriations, provide state-funded medical assistance to any child twelve years of age and younger, regardless of immigration status, (1) whose household income does not exceed two hundred one per cent of the federal poverty level without an asset limit, and (2) who does not otherwise qualify for Medicaid, the Children's Health Insurance Program, or an offer of affordable, employer-sponsored insurance, as defined in the Affordable Care Act, as an employee or a dependent of an employee. On and after July 1, 2024, the commissioner shall, within available appropriations, provide state-funded medical assistance to any child fifteen years of age and younger, regardless of immigration status, who qualifies pursuant to subdivisions (1) and (2) of this subsection. A child eligible for such assistance under this subsection shall continue to receive such assistance until such child is nineteen years of age, provided the child continues to meet the eligibility requirements prescribed in subdivisions (1) and (2) of this subsection. The provisions of section 17b-265 shall apply with respect to any medical assistance provided pursuant to this subsection."

              "(a) Any transfer or assignment of assets resulting in the imposition of a penalty period shall be presumed to be made with the intent, on the part of the transferor or the transferee, to enable the transferor to obtain or maintain eligibility for medical assistance. This presumption may be rebutted only by clear and convincing evidence that the transferor's eligibility or potential eligibility for medical assistance was not a basis for the transfer or assignment.",
              "(b) Any transfer or assignment of assets resulting in the establishment or imposition of a penalty period shall create a debt, as defined in section 36a-645 , that shall be due and owing by the transferor or transferee to the Department of Social Services in an amount equal to the amount of the medical assistance provided to or on behalf of the transferor on or after the date of the transfer of assets, but said amount shall not exceed the fair market value of the assets at the time of transfer. The Commissioner of Social Services, the Commissioner of Administrative Services and the Attorney General shall have the power or authority to seek administrative, legal or equitable relief as provided by other statutes or by common law.",
              "(c) The Commissioner of Social Services may waive the imposition of a penalty period when the transferor (1) in accordance with the provisions of section 3025.25 of the department's Uniform Policy Manual, suffers from dementia at the time of application for medical assistance and cannot explain transfers that would otherwise result in the imposition of a penalty period; or (2) suffered from dementia at the time of the transfer; or (3) was exploited into making such a transfer due to dementia. Waiver of the imposition of a penalty period does not prohibit the establishment of a debt in accordance with subsection (b) of this section.",
              "(d) (1) For purposes of this subsection, an “institutionalized individual” means an individual who has applied for or is receiving (A) services from a long-term care facility, (B) services from a medical institution that are equivalent to those services provided in a long-term care facility, or (C) home and community-based services under a Medicaid waiver.",
              "(2) An institutionalized individual shall not be penalized for the transfer of an asset if the entire amount of the transferred asset is returned to the institutionalized individual. A transferee may return any portion of a transferred asset to the transferor. If any transferred asset is returned to the transferor, the Department of Social Services shall adjust the penalty period to the extent permitted by federal law, provided the ending date of the penalty period as originally determined by the department shall not change. The department shall consider the entire amount of the returned asset to be available to the transferor only from the date of return of the transferred asset, and shall not determine the transferor to be ineligible in the month the transferred asset is returned, provided the transferor reduced the returned asset in accordance with federal law.",
              "(3) If there are multiple transfers of assets to the same or different transferees, a return of anything less than the total amount of the transferred assets from all of the separate transferees shall not constitute a return of the entire amount of the transferred assets and shall represent a partial return.",
              "(4) The conveyance and subsequent return of an asset for the purpose of shifting costs to the Medicaid program shall be regarded as a trust-like device. Such asset shall be considered available for the purpose of determining Medicaid eligibility. The conveyance and subsequent return of an asset made exclusively for a purpose other than to qualify for the payment of long-term care services under the Medicaid program shall not be regarded as a trust-like device.",
              "(e) The Commissioner of Social Services, pursuant to section 17b-10 , shall implement the policies and procedures necessary to carry out the provisions of this section while in the process of adopting such policies and procedures in regulation form, provided notice of intent to adopt regulations is published in the Connecticut Law Journal not later than twenty days after implementation.

This presumption may be rebutted only by clear and convincing evidence that the transferor's eligibility or potential eligibility for medical assistance was not a basis for the transfer or assignment.\n\n(b) Any transfer or assignment of assets resulting in the establishment or imposition of a penalty period shall create a debt, as defined in section 36a-645 , that shall be due and owing by the transferor or transferee to the Department of Social Services in an amount equal to the amount of the medical assistance provided to or on behalf of the transferor on or after the date of the transfer of assets, but said amount shall not exceed the fair market value of the assets at the time of transfer. The Commissioner of Social Services, the Commissioner of Administrative Services and the Attorney General shall have the power or authority to seek administrative, legal or equitable relief as provided by other statutes or by common law.\n\n(c) The Commissioner of Social Services may waive the imposition of a penalty period when the transferor (1) in accordance with the provisions of section 3025.25 of the department's Uniform Policy Manual, suffers from dementia at the time of application for medical assistance and cannot explain transfers that would otherwise result in the imposition of a penalty period; or (2) suffered from dementia at the time of the transfer; or (3) was exploited into making such a transfer due to dementia. Waiver of the imposition of a penalty period does not prohibit the establishment of a debt in accordance with subsection (b) of this section.\n\n(d) (1) For purposes of this subsection, an “institutionalized individual” means an individual who has applied for or is receiving (A) services from a long-term care facility, (B) services from a medical institution that are equivalent to those services provided in a long-term care facility, or (C) home and community-based services under a Medicaid waiver.\n\n(2) An institutionalized individual shall not be penalized for the transfer of an asset if the entire amount of the transferred asset is returned to the institutionalized individual. A transferee may return any portion of a transferred asset to the transferor. If any transferred asset is returned to the transferor, the Department of Social Services shall adjust the penalty period to the extent permitted by federal law, provided the ending date of the penalty period as originally determined by the department shall not change. The department shall consider the entire amount of the returned asset to be available to the transferor only from the date of return of the transferred asset, and shall not determine the transferor to be ineligible in the month the transferred asset is returned, provided the transferor reduced the returned asset in accordance with federal law.\n\n(3) If there are multiple transfers of assets to the same or different transferees, a return of anything less than the total amount of the transferred assets from all of the separate transferees shall not constitute a return of the entire amount of the transferred assets and shall represent a partial return.\n\n(4) The conveyance and subsequent return of an asset for the purpose of shifting costs to the Medicaid program shall be regarded as a trust-like device. Such asset shall be considered available for the purpose of determining Medicaid eligibility. The conveyance and subsequent return of an asset made exclusively for a purpose other than to qualify for the payment of long-term care services under the Medicaid program shall not be regarded as a trust-like device.\n\n(e) The Commissioner of Social Services, pursuant to section 17b-10 , shall implement the policies and procedures necessary to carry out the provisions of this section while in the process of adopting such policies and procedures in regulation form, provided notice of intent to adopt regulations is published in the Connecticut Law Journal not later than twenty days after implementation. Such policies and procedures shall be valid until the time final regulations are effective."

In the case of such a recipient who is an enrollee in a care management organization under a Medicaid care management contract with the state or a legally liable relative of such an enrollee, the department shall be subrogated to any right of recovery or indemnification which the enrollee or legally liable relative has against such a private insurer or other third party for the medical costs incurred by the care management organization on behalf of an enrollee. Whenever funds owed to a person are collected pursuant to this section and the person who otherwise would have been entitled to such funds is subject to a court-ordered current or arrearage child support payment obligation in an IV-D support case, such funds shall first be paid to the state for reimbursement of Medicaid funds paid on behalf of such person for medical expenses incurred for injuries related to a legal claim by such person that was the subject of the state's right of subrogation, and remaining funds, if any, shall then be paid to the Office of Child Support Services for distribution pursuant to the federally mandated child support distribution system implemented pursuant to subsection (j) of section 17b-179 . Any additional claim of the state to the remainder of such funds, if any, shall be paid in accordance with state law.",
              "(b) An applicant or recipient or legally liable relative, by the act of the applicant's or recipient's receiving medical assistance, shall be deemed to have made a subrogation assignment and an assignment of claim for benefits to the department. The department shall inform an applicant of such assignments at the time of application. Any entitlements from a contractual agreement with an applicant or recipient, legally liable relative or a state or federal program for such medical services, not to exceed the amount expended by the department, shall be so assigned. Such entitlements shall be directly reimbursable to the department by third-party payors. The Department of Social Services may assign its right to subrogation or its entitlement to benefits to a designee or a health care provider participating in the Medicaid program and providing services to an applicant or recipient, in order to assist the provider in obtaining payment for such services. In accordance with subsection (b) of section 38a-472 , a provider that has received an assignment from the department shall notify the recipient's health insurer or other legally liable third party including, but not limited to, a self-insured plan, group health plan, as defined in Section 607(1) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, service benefit plan, managed care organization, health care center, pharmacy benefit manager, dental benefit manager, third-party administrator or other party that is, by statute, contract or agreement, legally responsible for payment of a claim for a health care item or service, of the assignment upon rendition of services to the applicant or recipient. Failure to so notify the health insurer or other legally liable third party shall render the provider ineligible for payment from the department. The provider shall notify the department of any request by the applicant or recipient or legally liable relative or representative of such applicant or recipient for billing information. This subsection shall not be construed to affect the right of an applicant or recipient to maintain an independent cause of action against such third-party tortfeasor.",
              "(c) Claims for recovery or indemnification submitted by the department, or the department's designee, shall not be denied solely on the basis of the date of the submission of the claim, the type or format of the claim, the lack of prior authorization or the failure to present proper documentation at the point-of-service that is the basis of the claim, if (1) the claim is submitted by the state within the three-year period beginning on the date on which the item or service was furnished; and (2) any action by the state to enforce its rights with respect to such claim is commenced within six years of the state's submission of the claim.",

              "(e) When a recipient of medical assistance has personal health insurance in force covering care or other benefits provided under such program, payment or part-payment of the premium for such insurance may be made when deemed appropriate by the Commissioner of Social Services. The commissioner shall limit reimbursement to medical assistance providers for coinsurance and deductible payments under Title XVIII of the Social Security Act to assure that the combined Medicare and Medicaid payment to the provider shall not exceed the maximum allowable under the Medicaid program fee schedules.",

No insurer, as defined in section 38a-497a , shall impose requirements on the state Medicaid agency, which has been assigned the rights of an individual eligible for Medicaid and covered for health benefits from an insurer, that differ from requirements applicable to an agent or assignee of another individual so covered.",
              "(g) The Commissioner of Social Services shall not pay for any services provided under this chapter if the individual eligible for medical assistance has coverage for the services under an accident or health insurance policy.",
              "(h) An insurer or other legally liable third party, upon receipt of a claim submitted by the department or the department's designee, in accordance with the requirements of subsection (c) of this section, for payment of a health care item or service covered under a state medical assistance program administered by the department, shall, not later than sixty days after receipt of the claim or not later than November 30, 2023, whichever is later, (1) make payment on the claim, (2) request information necessary to determine its legal obligation to pay the claim, or (3) issue a written reason for denial of the claim.

In the case of such a recipient who is an enrollee in a care management organization under a Medicaid care management contract with the state or a legally liable relative of such an enrollee, the department shall be subrogated to any right of recovery or indemnification which the enrollee or legally liable relative has against such a private insurer or other third party for the medical costs incurred by the care management organization on behalf of an enrollee. Whenever funds owed to a person are collected pursuant to this section and the person who otherwise would have been entitled to such funds is subject to a court-ordered current or arrearage child support payment obligation in an IV-D support case, such funds shall first be paid to the state for reimbursement of Medicaid funds paid on behalf of such person for medical expenses incurred for injuries related to a legal claim by such person that was the subject of the state's right of subrogation, and remaining funds, if any, shall then be paid to the Office of Child Support Services for distribution pursuant to the federally mandated child support distribution system implemented pursuant to subsection (j) of section 17b-179 . Any additional claim of the state to the remainder of such funds, if any, shall be paid in accordance with state law.\n\n(b) An applicant or recipient or legally liable relative, by the act of the applicant's or recipient's receiving medical assistance, shall be deemed to have made a subrogation assignment and an assignment of claim for benefits to the department. The department shall inform an applicant of such assignments at the time of application. Any entitlements from a contractual agreement with an applicant or recipient, legally liable relative or a state or federal program for such medical services, not to exceed the amount expended by the department, shall be so assigned. Such entitlements shall be directly reimbursable to the department by third-party payors. The Department of Social Services may assign its right to subrogation or its entitlement to benefits to a designee or a health care provider participating in the Medicaid program and providing services to an applicant or recipient, in order to assist the provider in obtaining payment for such services. In accordance with subsection (b) of section 38a-472 , a provider that has received an assignment from the department shall notify the recipient's health insurer or other legally liable third party including, but not limited to, a self-insured plan, group health plan, as defined in Section 607(1) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, service benefit plan, managed care organization, health care center, pharmacy benefit manager, dental benefit manager, third-party administrator or other party that is, by statute, contract or agreement, legally responsible for payment of a claim for a health care item or service, of the assignment upon rendition of services to the applicant or recipient. Failure to so notify the health insurer or other legally liable third party shall render the provider ineligible for payment from the department. The provider shall notify the department of any request by the applicant or recipient or legally liable relative or representative of such applicant or recipient for billing information. This subsection shall not be construed to affect the right of an applicant or recipient to maintain an independent cause of action against such third-party tortfeasor.\n\n(c) Claims for recovery or indemnification submitted by the department, or the department's designee, shall not be denied solely on the basis of the date of the submission of the claim, the type or format of the claim, the lack of prior authorization or the failure to present proper documentation at the point-of-service that is the basis of the claim, if (1) the claim is submitted by the state within the three-year period beginning on the date on which the item or service was furnished; and (2) any action by the state to enforce its rights with respect to such claim is commenced within six years of the state's submission of the claim.\n\n(d) (1) A party to whom a claim for recovery or indemnification is submitted for an item or service furnished under the Medicaid state plan, or a waiver of such plan, who requires prior authorization for such item or service shall accept authorization provided by the Department of Social Services that the item or service is covered under such plan or waiver as if such authorization were the prior authorization made by such party for the item or service.\n\n(2) The provisions of subdivision (1) of this subsection shall not apply with respect to a claim for recovery or indemnification submitted to Medicare, a Medicare Advantage plan or a Medicare Part D plan.\n\n(e) When a recipient of medical assistance has personal health insurance in force covering care or other benefits provided under such program, payment or part-payment of the premium for such insurance may be made when deemed appropriate by the Commissioner of Social Services. The commissioner shall limit reimbursement to medical assistance providers for coinsurance and deductible payments under Title XVIII of the Social Security Act to assure that the combined Medicare and Medicaid payment to the provider shall not exceed the maximum allowable under the Medicaid program fee schedules.\n\n(f) No self-insured plan, group health plan, as defined in Section 607(1) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, service benefit plan, managed care plan, or any plan offered or administered by a health care center, pharmacy benefit manager, dental benefit manager, third-party administrator or other party that is, by statute, contract or agreement, legally responsible for payment of a claim for a health care item or service, shall contain any provision that has the effect of denying or limiting enrollment benefits or excluding coverage because services are rendered to an insured or beneficiary who is eligible for or who received medical assistance under this chapter. No insurer, as defined in section 38a-497a , shall impose requirements on the state Medicaid agency, which has been assigned the rights of an individual eligible for Medicaid and covered for health benefits from an insurer, that differ from requirements applicable to an agent or assignee of another individual so covered.\n\n(g) The Commissioner of Social Services shall not pay for any services provided under this chapter if the individual eligible for medical assistance has coverage for the services under an accident or health insurance policy.\n\n(h) An insurer or other legally liable third party, upon receipt of a claim submitted by the department or the department's designee, in accordance with the requirements of subsection (c) of this section, for payment of a health care item or service covered under a state medical assistance program administered by the department, shall, not later than sixty days after receipt of the claim or not later than November 30, 2023, whichever is later, (1) make payment on the claim, (2) request information necessary to determine its legal obligation to pay the claim, or (3) issue a written reason for denial of the claim. Failure to pay, request information necessary to determine legal obligation to pay or issue a written reason for denial of a claim not later than one hundred twenty days after receipt of the claim, or not later than January 30, 2024, whichever is later, creates an uncontestable obligation to pay the claim. The provisions of this subsection shall apply to all claims, including claims submitted by the department or the department's designee prior to July 1, 2021.\n\n(i) On and after July 1, 2021, an insurer or other legally liable third party who has reimbursed the department for a health care item or service paid for and covered under a state medical assistance program administered by the department shall, upon determining it is not liable and at risk for cost of the health care item or service, request any refund from the department not later than twelve months from the date of its reimbursement to the department."

The committee may, on an ad hoc basis, seek the participation of other state agencies or other interested parties in its deliberations. The members shall serve for terms of two years from the date of their appointment. Members may be appointed to more than one term. The Commissioner of Social Services, or the commissioner's designee, shall convene the committee following the Governor's designation of appointments. The administrative staff of the Department of Social Services shall serve as staff for said committee and assist with all ministerial duties. The Governor shall ensure that the committee membership includes Medicaid participating physicians and pharmacists, with experience serving recipients of medical assistance.\n\n(c) Committee members shall select a chairperson and vice-chairperson from the committee membership on an annual basis.\n\n(d) The committee shall meet at least biannually, and may meet at other times at the discretion of the chairperson and committee membership.

To the extent feasible, the department shall review all drugs included on the preferred drug list at least every twelve months, and may recommend additions to, and deletions from, the preferred drug list, to ensure that the preferred drug list provides for medically appropriate drug therapies for Medicaid patients. The Department of Social Services, in consultation with the Pharmaceutical and Therapeutics Committee, shall expand such drug list to include other classes of drugs, except as provided in subsection (f) of this section, in order to achieve savings reflected in the amounts appropriated to the department, for the various components of the program, in the state budget act.\n\n(f) Nonpreferred drugs in the classes of drugs included on the preferred drug lists shall be subject to prior authorization.

Upon timely notice, the department shall ensure that any drug that has been approved, or had any of its particular uses approved, by the United States Food and Drug Administration under a priority review classification, will be reviewed by the Pharmaceutical and Therapeutics Committee at the next regularly scheduled meeting.

Nonemergency services that are exempt from the prior authorization process shall include diagnostic, prevention, basic restoration procedures and nonsurgical extractions that are consistent with standard and reasonable dental practices. Payment for nonemergency dental services shall not exceed one thousand dollars per calendar year for an individual adult, provided services determined to be medically necessary, as defined in section 17b-259b , including dentures, shall not be subject to such payment cap. Dental benefit limitations shall apply to each client regardless of the number of providers serving the client. The commissioner may recoup payments for services that are determined not to be for an emergency condition or otherwise in excess of what is medically necessary. The commissioner shall periodically, but not less than quarterly, review payments for emergency dental services and basic restoration procedures for appropriateness of payment. For the purposes of this section, “emergency condition” means a dental condition manifesting itself by acute symptoms of sufficient severity, including severe pain, such that a prudent layperson, who possesses an average knowledge of health and medicine, could reasonably expect the absence of immediate dental attention to result in placing the health of the individual, or with respect to a pregnant woman, the health of the woman or her unborn child, in serious jeopardy, cause serious impairment to body functions or cause serious dysfunction of any body organ or part.\n\n(b) The Commissioner of Social Services may implement policies and procedures necessary to administer the provisions of this section while in the process of adopting such policies and procedures as regulation, provided the commissioner prints notice of intent to adopt regulations in the Connecticut Law Journal not later than twenty days after the date of implementation. Policies and procedures implemented pursuant to this section shall be valid until the time final regulations are adopted."

The user fee shall be (1) the sum of each nursing home's anticipated nursing home net revenue, including, but not limited to, its estimated net revenue from any increases in Medicaid payments, during the twelve-month period ending on June thirtieth of the succeeding calendar year, (2) which sum shall be multiplied by a percentage as determined by the Secretary of the Office of Policy and Management, in consultation with the Commissioner of Social Services, provided before January 1, 2008, such percentage shall not exceed six per cent, on and after January 1, 2008, and prior to October 1, 2011, and prior to July 1, 2017, such percentage shall not exceed five and one-half per cent, and on and after October 1, 2011, such percentage shall not exceed the maximum allowed under federal law, and (3) which product shall be divided by the sum of each nursing home's anticipated resident days during the twelve-month period ending on June thirtieth of the succeeding calendar year. The Commissioner of Social Services, in anticipating nursing home net revenue and resident days, shall use the most recently available nursing home net revenue and resident day information. Notwithstanding the provisions of this section, the Commissioner of Social Services may adjust the user fee as necessary to prevent the state from exceeding the maximum allowed under federal law.\n\n(b) Upon approval of the waiver of federal requirements for uniform and broad-based user fees in accordance with 42 CFR 433.68 pursuant to section 17b-323 , the Commissioner of Social Services shall redetermine the amount of the user fee and promptly notify the commissioner and nursing homes of such amount. The user fee shall be (1) the sum of each nursing home's anticipated nursing home net revenue, including, but not limited to, its estimated net revenue from any increases in Medicaid payments, during the twelve-month period ending on June thirtieth of the succeeding calendar year but not including any such anticipated net revenue of any nursing home exempted from such user fee due to waiver of federal requirements pursuant to section 17b-323 , (2) which sum shall be multiplied by a percentage as determined by the Secretary of the Office of Policy and Management, in consultation with the Commissioner of Social Services, provided before January 1, 2008, such percentage shall not exceed six per cent, on and after January 1, 2008, and prior to October 1, 2011, such percentage shall not exceed five and one-half per cent, and on and after October 1, 2011, such percentage shall not exceed the maximum allowed under federal law, and (3) which product shall be divided by the sum of each nursing home's anticipated resident days, but not including the anticipated resident days of any nursing home exempted from such user fee due to waiver of federal requirements pursuant to section 17b-323 . Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection, the amount of the user fee for each nursing home licensed for more than two hundred thirty beds or owned by a municipality shall be equal to the amount necessary to comply with federal provider tax uniformity waiver requirements as determined by the Commissioner of Social Services. The Commissioner of Social Services may increase retroactively the user fee for nursing homes not licensed for more than two hundred thirty beds and not owned by a municipality to the effective date of waiver of said federal requirements to offset user fee reductions necessary to meet the federal waiver requirements. On or before July 1, 2005, and biennially thereafter, the Commissioner of Social Services shall determine the amount of the user fee in accordance with this subsection. The Commissioner of Social Services, in anticipating nursing home net revenue and resident days, shall use the most recently available nursing home net revenue and resident day information.\n\n(c) (1) Following a redetermination of the resident day user fee by the Commissioner of Social Services pursuant to subsection (b) of this section, the Commissioner of Social Services shall notify the commissioner of the identity of (A) any nursing home subsequently exempted from the resident day user fee due to the waiver of federal requirements pursuant to section 17b-323 and the effective date of such waiver, (B) any nursing home licensed for more than two hundred thirty beds or owned by a municipality and the effective date of any change in its user fee, and (C) any nursing home for which the user fee is retroactively increased pursuant to subsection (b) of this section and the effective date of such increase. The Commissioner of Social Services shall provide notice of any such retroactive user fee increase to each nursing home so affected.\n\n(2) Upon being notified by the Commissioner of Social Services, the commissioner shall refund or credit to any nursing home subsequently exempted from the resident day user fee due to the waiver of federal requirements pursuant to section 17b-323 any resident day user fee collected from such home. No interest shall be payable on the amount of such refund or credit. Any such nursing home shall refund any fees paid by or on behalf of any resident to the party making such payment.\n\n(3) Upon being notified by the Commissioner of Social Services, the commissioner shall refund or credit to any nursing home licensed for more than two hundred thirty beds or owned by a municipality any resident day user fee collected from such home in excess of the resident day user fee that would have been payable had the user fee, as redetermined by the Commissioner of Social Services, been used in calculating the nursing home's resident day user fee. No interest shall be payable on the amount of such refund or credit.\n\n(4) Upon being notified by the Commissioner of Social Services, the commissioner shall notify any nursing home for which the user fee is retroactively increased pursuant to subsection (b) of this section of the additional amount of resident day user fee due and owing from such nursing home. Such a notice of additional amount due and owing to the commissioner shall not be treated as a notice of deficiency assessment by the commissioner nor shall the nursing home have, based on such notice of additional amount due, any right of protest or appeal to the commissioner as in the case of such a deficiency assessment. No interest shall be payable on such additional amount to the extent such additional amount is paid on or before the last day of the month next succeeding the month during which the Commissioner of Social Services provided notice of such retroactive user fee increase to such nursing home.\n\nSee Ch. 211c re nursing home user fee."

Such policy and plan shall provide that individuals with long-term care needs have the option to choose and receive long-term care and support in the least restrictive, appropriate setting. Such plan shall integrate the three components of a long-term care system including home and community-based services, supportive housing arrangements and nursing facilities. Such plan shall include: (1) A vision and mission statement for a long-term care system; (2) the current number of persons receiving services; (3) the current number of persons receiving long-term care supports and services in the community and the number receiving such supports and services in institutions; (4) demographic data concerning such persons by service type; (5) the current aggregate cost of such system of services; (6) forecasts of future demand for services; (7) the type of services available and the amount of funds necessary to meet the demand; (8) projected costs for programs associated with such system; (9) strategies to promote the partnership for long-term care program; (10) resources necessary to accomplish goals for the future; (11) funding sources available; and (12) the number and types of providers needed to deliver services.

The committee shall evaluate issues relative to long-term care in light of the United States Supreme Court decision, Olmstead v. L.C., 119 S. Ct. 2176 (1999), requiring states to place persons with disabilities in community settings rather than in institutions when such placement is appropriate, the transfer to a less restrictive setting is not opposed by such persons and such placement can be reasonably accommodated. The committee, within available appropriations, shall evaluate available data on the average net actual Medicaid expenditures for nursing homes, in comparison to average net actual Medicaid expenditures for home and community-based services waiver participants who require a nursing home level of care, including the number of individuals served, to assist in short-term and long-term Medicaid expenditure forecasting.",

            "text": "(a) There shall be established a Long-Term Care Planning Committee for the purpose of exchanging information on long-term care issues, coordinating policy development and establishing a long-term care plan for all persons in need of long-term care. Such policy and plan shall provide that individuals with long-term care needs have the option to choose and receive long-term care and support in the least restrictive, appropriate setting. Such plan shall integrate the three components of a long-term care system including home and community-based services, supportive housing arrangements and nursing facilities. Such plan shall include: (1) A vision and mission statement for a long-term care system; (2) the current number of persons receiving services; (3) the current number of persons receiving long-term care supports and services in the community and the number receiving such supports and services in institutions; (4) demographic data concerning such persons by service type; (5) the current aggregate cost of such system of services; (6) forecasts of future demand for services; (7) the type of services available and the amount of funds necessary to meet the demand; (8) projected costs for programs associated with such system; (9) strategies to promote the partnership for long-term care program; (10) resources necessary to accomplish goals for the future; (11) funding sources available; and (12) the number and types of providers needed to deliver services. The plan shall address how changes in one component of such long-term care system impact other components of such system.\n\n(b) The Long-Term Care Planning Committee shall, within available appropriations, study issues relative to long-term care including, but not limited to, the case-mix system of Medicaid reimbursement, community-based service options, access to long-term care and geriatric psychiatric services. The committee shall evaluate issues relative to long-term care in light of the United States Supreme Court decision, Olmstead v. L.C., 119 S. Ct. 2176 (1999), requiring states to place persons with disabilities in community settings rather than in institutions when such placement is appropriate, the transfer to a less restrictive setting is not opposed by such persons and such placement can be reasonably accommodated. The committee, within available appropriations, shall evaluate available data on the average net actual Medicaid expenditures for nursing homes, in comparison to average net actual Medicaid expenditures for home and community-based services waiver participants who require a nursing home level of care, including the number of individuals served, to assist in short-term and long-term Medicaid expenditure forecasting.\n\n(c) The Long-Term Care Planning Committee shall consist of: (1) The chairpersons and ranking members of the joint standing committees of the General Assembly having cognizance of matters relating to human services, public health, elderly services and long-term care; (2) the Commissioner of Social Services, or the commissioner's designee; (3) one member of the Office of Policy and Management appointed by the Secretary of the Office of Policy and Management; (4) one member from the Department of Public Health appointed by the Commissioner of Public Health; (5) one member from the Department of Housing appointed by the Commissioner of Housing; (6) one member from the Department of Developmental Services appointed by the Commissioner of Developmental Services; (7) one member from the Department of Mental Health and Addiction Services appointed by the Commissioner of Mental Health and Addiction Services; (8) one member from the Department of Transportation appointed by the Commissioner of Transportation; (9) one member from the Department of Children and Families appointed by the Commissioner of Children and Families; (10) one member from the Health Systems Planning Unit of the Office of Health Strategy appointed by the Commissioner of Health Strategy; and (11) one member from the Department of Aging and Disability Services appointed by the Commissioner of Aging and Disability Services. The committee shall convene no later than ninety days after June 4, 1998. Any vacancy shall be filled by the appointing authority. The chairperson shall be elected from among the members of the committee. The committee shall seek the advice and participation of any person, organization or state or federal agency it deems necessary to carry out the provisions of this section.\n\n(d) Not later than January 1, 2018, and annually thereafter, the Long-Term Care Planning Committee shall submit a report to the joint standing committees of the General Assembly having cognizance of matters relating to aging and human services on the number of persons receiving (1) long-term care supports and services in the community; and (2) long-term care supports and services in institutions.\n\n(e) Not later than January 1, 1999, and every three years thereafter, the Long-Term Care Planning Committee shall submit a long-term care plan pursuant to subsection (a) of this section to the joint standing committees of the General Assembly having cognizance of matters relating to human services, public health, elderly services and long-term care, in accordance with the provisions of section 11-4a , and such plan shall serve as a guide for the actions of state agencies in developing and modifying programs that serve persons in need of long-term care.\n\n(f) Any state agency, when developing or modifying any program that, in whole or in part, provides assistance or support to persons with long-term care needs, shall, to the maximum extent feasible, include provisions that support care-giving provided by family members and other informal caregivers and promote consumer-directed care."

              "(a) For purposes of this subsection, (1) a “related party” includes, but is not limited to, any company related to a chronic and convalescent nursing home through family association, common ownership, control or business association with any of the owners, operators or officials of such nursing home; (2) “company” means any person, partnership, association, holding company, limited liability company or corporation; (3) “family association” means a relationship by birth, marriage or domestic partnership; and (4) “profit and loss statement” means the most recent annual statement on profits and losses finalized by a related party before the annual report mandated under this subsection. The rates to be paid by or for persons aided or cared for by the state or any town in this state to licensed chronic and convalescent nursing homes, to chronic disease hospitals associated with chronic and convalescent nursing homes, to rest homes with nursing supervision, to licensed residential care homes, as defined by section 19a-490 , and to residential facilities for persons with intellectual disability that are licensed pursuant to section 17a-227 and certified to participate in the Title XIX Medicaid program as intermediate care facilities for individuals with intellectual disabilities, for room, board and services specified in licensing regulations issued by the licensing agency shall be determined annually, except as otherwise provided in this subsection by the Commissioner of Social Services, to be effective July first of each year except as otherwise provided in this subsection. Such rates shall be determined on a basis of a reasonable payment for such necessary services, which basis shall take into account as a factor the costs of such services. Cost of such services shall include reasonable costs mandated by collective bargaining agreements with certified collective bargaining agents or other agreements between the employer and employees, provided “employees” shall not include persons employed as managers or chief administrators or required to be licensed as nursing home administrators, and compensation for services rendered by proprietors at prevailing wage rates, as determined by application of principles of accounting as prescribed by said commissioner. Cost of such services shall not include amounts paid by the facilities to employees as salary, or to attorneys or consultants as fees, where the responsibility of the employees, attorneys, or consultants is to persuade or seek to persuade the other employees of the facility to support or oppose unionization. Nothing in this subsection shall prohibit inclusion of amounts paid for legal counsel related to the negotiation of collective bargaining agreements, the settlement of grievances or normal administration of labor relations. The commissioner may, in the commissioner's discretion, allow the inclusion of extraordinary and unanticipated costs of providing services that were incurred to avoid an immediate negative impact on the health and safety of patients. The commissioner may, in the commissioner's discretion, based upon review of a facility's costs, direct care staff to patient ratio and any other related information, revise a facility's rate for any increases or decreases to total licensed capacity of more than ten beds or changes to its number of licensed rest home with nursing supervision beds and chronic and convalescent nursing home beds. The commissioner may, in the commissioner's discretion, revise the rate of a facility that is closing. An interim rate issued for the period during which a facility is closing shall be based on a review of facility costs, the expected duration of the close-down period, the anticipated impact on Medicaid costs, available appropriations and the relationship of the rate requested by the facility to the average Medicaid rate for a close-down period. The commissioner may so revise a facility's rate established for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1993, and thereafter for any bed increases, decreases or changes in licensure effective after October 1, 1989. Effective July 1, 1991, in facilities that have both a chronic and convalescent nursing home and a rest home with nursing supervision, the rate for the rest home with nursing supervision shall not exceed such facility's rate for its chronic and convalescent nursing home. All such facilities for which rates are determined under this subsection shall report on a fiscal year basis ending on September thirtieth. Such report shall be submitted to the commissioner by February fifteenth. Each chronic and convalescent nursing home that receives state funding pursuant to this section shall include in such annual report a profit and loss statement from each related party that receives from such chronic and convalescent nursing home thirty thousand dollars or more per year for goods, fees and services. No cause of action or liability shall arise against the state, the Department of Social Services, any state official or agent for failure to take action based on the information required to be reported under this subsection. The commissioner may reduce the rate in effect for a facility that fails to submit a complete and accurate report on or before February fifteenth by an amount not to exceed ten per cent of such rate. If a licensed residential care home fails to submit a complete and accurate report, the department shall notify such home of the failure and the home shall have thirty days from the date the notice was issued to submit a complete and accurate report. If a licensed residential care home fails to submit a complete and accurate report not later than thirty days after the date of notice, such home may not receive a retroactive rate increase, in the commissioner's discretion. The commissioner shall, annually, on or before April first, report the data contained in the reports of such facilities on the department's Internet web site. For the cost reporting year commencing October 1, 1985, and for subsequent cost reporting years, facilities shall report the cost of using the services of any nursing personnel supplied by a temporary nursing services agency by separating said cost into two categories, the portion of the cost equal to the salary of the employee for whom the nursing personnel supplied by a temporary nursing services agency is substituting shall be considered a nursing cost and any cost in excess of such salary shall be further divided so that seventy-five per cent of the excess cost shall be considered an administrative or general cost and twenty-five per cent of the excess cost shall be considered a nursing cost, provided if the total costs of a facility for nursing personnel supplied by a temporary nursing services agency in any cost year are equal to or exceed fifteen per cent of the total nursing expenditures of the facility for such cost year, no portion of such costs in excess of fifteen per cent shall be classified as administrative or general costs. The commissioner, in determining such rates, shall also take into account the classification of patients or boarders according to special care requirements or classification of the facility according to such factors as facilities and services and such other factors as the commissioner deems reasonable, including anticipated fluctuations in the cost of providing such services. The commissioner may establish a separate rate for a facility or a portion of a facility for traumatic brain injury patients who require extensive care but not acute general hospital care. Such separate rate shall reflect the special care requirements of such patients. If changes in federal or state laws, regulations or standards adopted subsequent to June 30, 1985, result in increased costs or expenditures in an amount exceeding one-half of one per cent of allowable costs for the most recent cost reporting year, the commissioner shall adjust rates and provide payment for any such increased reasonable costs or expenditures within a reasonable period of time retroactive to the date of enforcement. Nothing in this section shall be construed to require the Department of Social Services to adjust rates and provide payment for any increases in costs resulting from an inspection of a facility by the Department of Public Health. Such assistance as the commissioner requires from other state agencies or departments in determining rates shall be made available to the commissioner at the commissioner's request. Payment of the rates established pursuant to this section shall be conditioned on the establishment by such facilities of admissions procedures that conform with this section, section 19a-533 and all other applicable provisions of the law and the provision of equality of treatment to all persons in such facilities. The established rates shall be the maximum amount chargeable by such facilities for care of such beneficiaries, and the acceptance by or on behalf of any such facility of any additional compensation for care of any such beneficiary from any other person or source shall constitute the offense of aiding a beneficiary to obtain aid to which the beneficiary is not entitled and shall be punishable in the same manner as is provided in subsection (b) of section 17b-97 . Notwithstanding any provision of this section, the Commissioner of Social Services may, within available appropriations, provide an interim rate increase for a licensed chronic and convalescent nursing home or a rest home with nursing supervision for rate periods no earlier than April 1, 2004, only if the commissioner determines that the increase is necessary to avoid the filing of a petition for relief under Title 11 of the United States Code; imposition of receivership pursuant to sections 19a-542 and 19a-543 ; or substantial deterioration of the facility's financial condition that may be expected to adversely affect resident care and the continued operation of the facility, and the commissioner determines that the continued operation of the facility is in the best interest of the state. The commissioner shall consider any requests for interim rate increases on file with the department from March 30, 2004, and those submitted subsequently for rate periods no earlier than April 1, 2004. When reviewing an interim rate increase request the commissioner shall, at a minimum, consider: (A) Existing chronic and convalescent nursing home or rest home with nursing supervision utilization in the area and projected bed need; (B) physical plant long-term viability and the ability of the owner or purchaser to implement any necessary property improvements; (C) licensure and certification compliance history; (D) reasonableness of actual and projected expenses; and (E) the ability of the facility to meet wage and benefit costs. No interim rate shall be increased pursuant to this subsection in excess of one hundred fifteen per cent of the median rate for the facility's peer grouping, established pursuant to subdivision (3) of subsection (a) of section 17b-340d , unless recommended by the commissioner and approved by the Secretary of the Office of Policy and Management after consultation with the commissioner. Such median rates shall be published by the Department of Social Services not later than April first of each year. In the event that a facility granted an interim rate increase pursuant to this section is sold or otherwise conveyed for value to an unrelated entity less than five years after the effective date of such rate increase, the rate increase shall be deemed rescinded and the department shall recover an amount equal to the difference between payments made for all affected rate periods and payments that would have been made if the interim rate increase was not granted. The commissioner may seek recovery of such payments from any facility with common ownership. With the approval of the Secretary of the Office of Policy and Management, the commissioner may waive recovery and rescission of the interim rate for good cause shown that is not inconsistent with this section, including, but not limited to, transfers to family members that were made for no value. The commissioner shall provide written quarterly reports to the joint standing committees of the General Assembly having cognizance of matters relating to aging, human services and appropriations and the budgets of state agencies, that identify each facility requesting an interim rate increase, the amount of the requested rate increase for each facility, the action taken by the commissioner and the secretary pursuant to this subsection, and estimates of the additional cost to the state for each approved interim rate increase. Nothing in this subsection shall prohibit the commissioner from increasing the rate of a licensed chronic and convalescent nursing home or a rest home with nursing supervision for allowable costs associated with facility capital improvements or increasing the rate in case of a sale of a licensed chronic and convalescent nursing home or a rest home with nursing supervision if receivership has been imposed on such home. For purposes of this section, “temporary nursing services agency” and “nursing personnel” have the same meaning as provided in section 19a-118 .",
              "(b) The Commissioner of Social Services may implement policies and procedures as necessary to carry out the provisions of this section while in the process of adopting the policies and procedures as regulations, provided notice of intent to adopt the regulations is published in accordance with the provisions of section 17b-10 not later than twenty days after the date of implementation.",
              "(c) No facility subject to the requirements of this section shall accept payment in excess of the rate set by the commissioner pursuant to subsection (a) of this section for any medical assistance patient from this or any other state. No facility shall accept payment in excess of the reasonable and necessary costs of other allowable services as specified by the commissioner pursuant to the regulations adopted under subsection (b) of this section for any public assistance patient from this or any other state. Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection, the commissioner may authorize a facility to accept payment in excess of the rate paid for a medical assistance patient in this state for a patient who receives medical assistance from another state.",
              "(d) In any instance where the Commissioner of Social Services finds that a facility subject to the requirements of this section is accepting payment for a medical assistance beneficiary in violation of subsection (c) of this section, the commissioner shall proceed to recover through the rate set for the facility any sum in excess of the stipulated per diem and other allowable costs, as provided for in regulations adopted pursuant to subsections (a) and (b) of this section. The commissioner shall make the recovery prospectively at the time of the next annual rate redetermination.",
              "(e) Except as provided in this subsection, the provisions of subsections (c) and (d) of this section shall not apply to any facility subject to the requirements of this section, which on October 1, 1981, (1) was accepting payments from the commissioner in accordance with the provisions of subsection (a) of this section, (2) was accepting medical assistance payments from another state for at least twenty per cent of its patients, and (3) had not notified the commissioner of any intent to terminate its provider agreement, in accordance with section 17b-271 , provided no patient residing in any such facility on May 22, 1984, shall be removed from such facility for purposes of meeting the requirements of this subsection. If the commissioner finds that the number of beds available to medical assistance patients from this state in any such facility is less than fifteen per cent the provisions of subsections (c) and (d) of this section shall apply to that number of beds which is less than said percentage.",
              "(f) For the fiscal years ending on or before June 30, 2022, rates for nursing home facilities shall be set in accordance with this subsection. On and after July 1, 2022, such rates shall be set in accordance with section 17b-340d . For the fiscal year ending June 30, 1992, the rates paid by or for persons aided or cared for by the state or any town in this state to facilities for room, board and services specified in licensing regulations issued by the licensing agency, except intermediate care facilities for individuals with intellectual disabilities and residential care homes, shall be based on the cost year ending September 30, 1989. For the fiscal years ending June 30, 1993, and June 30, 1994, such rates shall be based on the cost year ending September 30, 1990. Such rates shall be determined by the Commissioner of Social Services in accordance with this section and the regulations of Connecticut state agencies promulgated by the commissioner and in effect on April 1, 1991, except that:",
              "(1) Allowable costs shall be divided into the following five cost components: (A) Direct costs, which shall include salaries for nursing personnel, related fringe benefits and costs for nursing personnel supplied by a temporary nursing services agency; (B) indirect costs, which shall include professional fees, dietary expenses, housekeeping expenses, laundry expenses, supplies related to patient care, salaries for indirect care personnel and related fringe benefits; (C) fair rent, which shall be defined in accordance with subsection (f) of section 17-311-52 of the regulations of Connecticut state agencies; (D) capital-related costs, which shall include property taxes, insurance expenses, equipment leases and equipment depreciation; and (E) administrative and general costs, which shall include (i) maintenance and operation of plant expenses, (ii) salaries for administrative and maintenance personnel, and (iii) related fringe benefits. The commissioner may provide a rate adjustment for nonemergency transportation services required by nursing facility residents. Such adjustment shall be a fixed amount determined annually by the commissioner based upon a review of costs and other associated information. Allowable costs shall not include costs for ancillary services payable under Part B of the Medicare program.",
              "(2) Two geographic peer groupings of facilities shall be established for each level of care, as defined by the Department of Social Services for the determination of rates, for the purpose of determining allowable direct costs. One peer grouping shall be comprised of those facilities located in Fairfield County. The other peer grouping shall be comprised of facilities located in all other counties.",

The Commissioner of Social Services shall add fair rent increases to any other rate increases established pursuant to this subdivision for a facility which has undergone a material change in circumstances related to fair rent, except for the fiscal years ending June 30, 2010, June 30, 2011, and June 30, 2012, such fair rent increases shall only be provided to facilities with an approved certificate of need pursuant to section 17b-352 , 17b-353 , 17b-354 or 17b-355 . For the fiscal year ending June 30, 2013, the commissioner may, within available appropriations, provide pro rata fair rent increases for facilities which have undergone a material change in circumstances related to fair rent additions placed in service in cost report years ending September 30, 2008, to September 30, 2011, inclusive, and not otherwise included in rates issued. For the fiscal years ending June 30, 2014, and June 30, 2015, the commissioner may, within available appropriations, provide pro rata fair rent increases, which may include moveable equipment at the discretion of the commissioner, for facilities which have undergone a material change in circumstances related to fair rent additions or moveable equipment placed in service in cost report years ending September 30, 2012, and September 30, 2013, and not otherwise included in rates issued. The commissioner shall add fair rent increases associated with an approved certificate of need pursuant to section 17b-352 , 17b-353 , 17b-354 or 17b-355 . Interim rates may take into account reasonable costs incurred by a facility, including wages and benefits. Notwithstanding the provisions of this section, the Commissioner of Social Services may, subject to available appropriations, increase or decrease rates issued to licensed chronic and convalescent nursing homes and licensed rest homes with nursing supervision. Notwithstanding any provision of this section, the Commissioner of Social Services shall, effective July 1, 2015, within available appropriations, adjust facility rates in accordance with the application of standard accounting principles as prescribed by the commissioner, for each facility subject to subsection (a) of this section. Such adjustment shall provide a pro-rata increase based on direct and indirect care employee salaries reported in the 2014 annual cost report, and adjusted to reflect subsequent salary increases, to reflect reasonable costs mandated by collective bargaining agreements with certified collective bargaining agents, or otherwise provided by a facility to its employees. For purposes of this subsection, “employee” shall not include a person employed as a facility's manager, chief administrator, a person required to be licensed as a nursing home administrator or any individual who receives compensation for services pursuant to a contractual arrangement and who is not directly employed by the facility. The commissioner may establish an upper limit for reasonable costs associated with salary adjustments beyond which the adjustment shall not apply. Nothing in this section shall require the commissioner to distribute such adjustments in a way that jeopardizes anticipated federal reimbursement. Facilities that receive such adjustment but do not provide increases in employee salaries as described in this subsection on or before July 31, 2015, may be subject to a rate decrease in the same amount as the adjustment by the commissioner. Of the amount appropriated for this purpose, no more than nine million dollars shall go to increases based on reasonable costs mandated by collective bargaining agreements. Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection, and section 17b-340d , effective July 1, 2019, October 1, 2020, January 1, 2021, July 1, 2021, and July 1, 2022, the commissioner shall, within available appropriations, increase rates for the purpose of wage and benefit enhancements for facility employees. The commissioner shall adjust the rate paid to the facility in the form of a rate adjustment to reflect any rate increases paid after the cost report year ending September 30, 2018. Facilities that receive a rate adjustment for the purpose of wage and benefit enhancements but do not provide increases in employee salaries as described in this subsection on or before September 30, 2019, October 31, 2020, January 31, 2021, July 31, 2021, and July 31, 2022, respectively, may be subject to a rate decrease in the same amount as the adjustment by the commissioner.",
              "(5) For the purpose of determining allowable fair rent, a facility with allowable fair rent less than the twenty-fifth percentile of the state-wide allowable fair rent shall be reimbursed as having allowable fair rent equal to the twenty-fifth percentile of the state-wide allowable fair rent, provided for the fiscal years ending June 30, 1996, and June 30, 1997, the reimbursement may not exceed the twenty-fifth percentile of the state-wide allowable fair rent for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1995. On and after July 1, 1998, the Commissioner of Social Services may allow minimum fair rent as the basis upon which reimbursement associated with improvements to real property is added. Beginning with the fiscal year ending June 30, 1996, any facility with a rate of return on real property other than land in excess of eleven per cent shall have such allowance revised to eleven per cent. Any facility or its related realty affiliate which finances or refinances debt through bonds issued by the State of Connecticut Health and Education Facilities Authority shall report the terms and conditions of such financing or refinancing to the Commissioner of Social Services within thirty days of completing such financing or refinancing. The Commissioner of Social Services may revise the facility's fair rent component of its rate to reflect any financial benefit the facility or its related realty affiliate received as a result of such financing or refinancing, including but not limited to, reductions in the amount of debt service payments or period of debt repayment. The commissioner shall allow actual debt service costs for bonds issued by the State of Connecticut Health and Educational Facilities Authority if such costs do not exceed property costs allowed pursuant to subsection (f) of section 17-311-52 of the regulations of Connecticut state agencies, provided the commissioner may allow higher debt service costs for such bonds for good cause. For facilities which first open on or after October 1, 1992, the commissioner shall determine allowable fair rent for real property other than land based on the rate of return for the cost year in which such bonds were issued. The financial benefit resulting from a facility financing or refinancing debt through such bonds shall be shared between the state and the facility to an extent determined by the commissioner on a case-by-case basis and shall be reflected in an adjustment to the facility's allowable fair rent.",
              "(6) A facility shall receive cost efficiency adjustments for indirect costs and for administrative and general costs if such costs are below the state-wide median costs. The cost efficiency adjustments shall equal twenty-five per cent of the difference between allowable reported costs and the applicable median allowable cost established pursuant to this subdivision.",
              "(7) For the fiscal year ending June 30, 1992, allowable operating costs, excluding fair rent, shall be inflated using the Regional Data Resources Incorporated McGraw-Hill Health Care Costs: Consumer Price Index (all urban) - All Items minus one and one-half per cent.

For the fiscal year ending June 30, 1996, allowable operating costs, excluding fair rent, shall be inflated using the Regional Data Resources Incorporated McGraw-Hill Health Care Costs: Consumer Price Index (all urban) - All Items minus two and one-half per cent. For the fiscal year ending June 30, 1997, allowable operating costs, excluding fair rent, shall be inflated using the Regional Data Resources Incorporated McGraw-Hill Health Care Costs: Consumer Price Index (all urban) - All Items minus three and one-half per cent. For the fiscal year ending June 30, 1992, and any succeeding fiscal year, allowable fair rent shall be those reported in the annual report of long-term care facilities for the cost year ending the immediately preceding September thirtieth. The inflation index to be used pursuant to this subsection shall be computed to reflect inflation between the midpoint of the cost year through the midpoint of the rate year. The Department of Social Services shall study methods of reimbursement for fair rent and shall report its findings and recommendations to the joint standing committee of the General Assembly having cognizance of matters relating to human services on or before January 15, 1993.",
              "(8) On and after July 1, 1994, costs shall be rebased no more frequently than every two years and no less frequently than every four years, as determined by the commissioner. The commissioner shall determine whether and to what extent a change in ownership of a facility shall occasion the rebasing of the facility's costs.",
              "(9) The method of establishing rates for new facilities shall be determined by the commissioner in accordance with the provisions of this subsection until June 30, 2022.",
              "(10) Rates determined under this section shall comply with federal laws and regulations.",
              "(11) Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection, interim rates issued for facilities on and after July 1, 1991, shall be subject to applicable fiscal year cost component limitations established pursuant to subdivision (3) of this subsection.",
              "(12) A chronic and convalescent nursing home having an ownership affiliation with and operated at the same location as a chronic disease hospital may request that the commissioner approve an exception to applicable rate-setting provisions for chronic and convalescent nursing homes and establish a rate for the fiscal years ending June 30, 1992, and June 30, 1993, in accordance with regulations in effect June 30, 1991. Any such rate shall not exceed one hundred sixty-five per cent of the median rate established for chronic and convalescent nursing homes established under this section for the applicable fiscal year.",
              "(13) For the fiscal year ending June 30, 2014, and any succeeding fiscal year, for purposes of computing minimum allowable patient days, utilization of a facility's certified beds shall be determined at a minimum of ninety per cent of capacity, except for new facilities and facilities which are certified for additional beds which may be permitted a lower occupancy rate for the first three months of operation after the effective date of licensure.",
              "(14) The Commissioner of Social Services shall adjust facility rates from April 1, 1999, to June 30, 1999, inclusive, by a per diem amount representing each facility's allocation of funds appropriated for the purpose of wage, benefit and staffing enhancement. A facility's per diem allocation of such funding shall be computed as follows: (A) The facility's direct and indirect component salary, wage, nursing pool and allocated fringe benefit costs as filed for the 1998 cost report period deemed allowable in accordance with this section and applicable regulations without application of cost component maximums specified in subdivision (3) of this subsection shall be totalled; (B) such total shall be multiplied by the facility's Medicaid utilization based on the 1998 cost report; (C) the resulting amount for the facility shall be divided by the sum of the calculations specified in subparagraphs (A) and (B) of this subdivision for all facilities to determine the facility's percentage share of appropriated wage, benefit and staffing enhancement funding; (D) the facility's percentage share shall be multiplied by the amount of appropriated wage, benefit and staffing enhancement funding to determine the facility's allocated amount; and (E) such allocated amount shall be divided by the number of days of care paid for by Medicaid on an annual basis including days for reserved beds specified in the 1998 cost report to determine the per diem wage and benefit rate adjustment amount. The commissioner may adjust a facility's reported 1998 cost and utilization data for the purposes of determining a facility's share of wage, benefit and staffing enhancement funding when reported 1998 information is not substantially representative of estimated cost and utilization data for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2000, due to special circumstances during the 1998 cost report period including change of ownership with a part year cost filing or reductions in facility capacity due to facility renovation projects. Upon completion of the calculation of the allocation of wage, benefit and staffing enhancement funding, the commissioner shall not adjust the allocations due to revisions submitted to previously filed 1998 annual cost reports. In the event that a facility's rate for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1999, is an interim rate or the rate includes an increase adjustment due to a rate request to the commissioner or other reasons, the commissioner may reduce or withhold the per diem wage, benefit and staffing enhancement allocation computed for the facility. Any enhancement allocations not applied to facility rates shall not be reallocated to other facilities and such unallocated amounts shall be available for the costs associated with interim rates and other Medicaid expenditures. The wage, benefit and staffing enhancement per diem adjustment for the period from April 1, 1999, to June 30, 1999, inclusive, shall also be applied to rates for the fiscal years ending June 30, 2000, and June 30, 2001, except that the commissioner may increase or decrease the adjustment to account for changes in facility capacity or operations. Any facility accepting a rate adjustment for wage, benefit and staffing enhancements shall apply payments made as a result of such rate adjustment for increased allowable employee wage rates and benefits and additional direct and indirect component staffing. Adjustment funding shall not be applied to wage and salary increases provided to the administrator, assistant administrator, owners or related party employees. Enhancement payments may be applied to increases in costs associated with staffing purchased from staffing agencies provided such costs are deemed necessary and reasonable by the commissioner. The commissioner shall compare expenditures for wages, benefits and staffing for the 1998 cost report period to such expenditures in the 1999, 2000 and 2001 cost report periods to verify whether a facility has applied additional payments to specified enhancements. In the event that the commissioner determines that a facility did not apply additional payments to specified enhancements, the commissioner shall recover such amounts from the facility through rate adjustments or other means. The commissioner may require facilities to file cost reporting forms, in addition to the annual cost report, as may be necessary, to verify the appropriate application of wage, benefit and staffing enhancement rate adjustment payments. For the purposes of this subdivision, “Medicaid utilization” means the number of days of care paid for by Medicaid on an annual basis including days for reserved beds as a percentage of total resident days.",
              "(g) The established interim rate to become effective upon sale of any licensed chronic and convalescent home or rest home with nursing supervision for which a receivership has been imposed pursuant to sections 19a-541 to 19a-549 , inclusive, shall not exceed the rate in effect for the facility at the time of the imposition of the receivership, subject to any annual increases permitted by this section, provided the Commissioner of Social Services may, in the commissioner's discretion and after consultation with the receiver, establish an increased rate for the facility if the commissioner, with the approval of the Secretary of the Office of Policy and Management, determines that such higher rate is needed to keep the facility open and to ensure the health, safety and welfare of the residents at such facility.",
              "(h) (1) For the fiscal year ending June 30, 1993, any intermediate care facility for individuals with intellectual disabilities with an operating cost component of its rate in excess of one hundred forty per cent of the median of operating cost components of rates in effect January 1, 1992, shall not receive an operating cost component increase. For the fiscal year ending June 30, 1993, any intermediate care facility for individuals with intellectual disabilities with an operating cost component of its rate that is less than one hundred forty per cent of the median of operating cost components of rates in effect January 1, 1992, shall have an allowance for real wage growth equal to thirty per cent of the increase determined in accordance with subsection (q) of section 17-311-52 of the regulations of Connecticut state agencies, provided such operating cost component shall not exceed one hundred forty per cent of the median of operating cost components in effect January 1, 1992. Any facility with real property other than land placed in service prior to October 1, 1991, shall, for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1995, receive a rate of return on real property equal to the average of the rates of return applied to real property other than land placed in service for the five years preceding October 1, 1993. For the fiscal year ending June 30, 1996, and any succeeding fiscal year, the rate of return on real property for property items shall be revised every five years. The commissioner shall, upon submission of a request, allow actual debt service, comprised of principal and interest, in excess of property costs allowed pursuant to section 17-311-52 of the regulations of Connecticut state agencies, provided such debt service terms and amounts are reasonable in relation to the useful life and the base value of the property.

For the fiscal year ending June 30, 1996, and any succeeding fiscal year, no rate shall exceed three hundred seventy-five dollars per day unless the commissioner, in consultation with the Commissioner of Developmental Services, determines after a review of program and management costs, that a rate in excess of this amount is necessary for care and treatment of facility residents. For the fiscal year ending June 30, 2002, rate period, the Commissioner of Social Services shall increase the inflation adjustment for rates made in accordance with subsection (p) of section 17-311-52 of the regulations of Connecticut state agencies to update allowable fiscal year 2000 costs to include a three and one-half per cent inflation factor. For the fiscal year ending June 30, 2003, rate period, the commissioner shall increase the inflation adjustment for rates made in accordance with subsection (p) of section 17-311-52 of the regulations of Connecticut state agencies to update allowable fiscal year 2001 costs to include a one and one-half per cent inflation factor, except that such increase shall be effective November 1, 2002, and such facility rate in effect for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2002, shall be paid for services provided until October 31, 2002, except any facility that would have been issued a lower rate effective July 1, 2002, than for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2002, due to interim rate status or agreement with the department shall be issued such lower rate effective July 1, 2002, and have such rate updated effective November 1, 2002, in accordance with applicable statutes and regulations.

            "text": "(a) For purposes of this subsection, (1) a “related party” includes, but is not limited to, any company related to a chronic and convalescent nursing home through family association, common ownership, control or business association with any of the owners, operators or officials of such nursing home; (2) “company” means any person, partnership, association, holding company, limited liability company or corporation; (3) “family association” means a relationship by birth, marriage or domestic partnership; and (4) “profit and loss statement” means the most recent annual statement on profits and losses finalized by a related party before the annual report mandated under this subsection. The rates to be paid by or for persons aided or cared for by the state or any town in this state to licensed chronic and convalescent nursing homes, to chronic disease hospitals associated with chronic and convalescent nursing homes, to rest homes with nursing supervision, to licensed residential care homes, as defined by section 19a-490 , and to residential facilities for persons with intellectual disability that are licensed pursuant to section 17a-227 and certified to participate in the Title XIX Medicaid program as intermediate care facilities for individuals with intellectual disabilities, for room, board and services specified in licensing regulations issued by the licensing agency shall be determined annually, except as otherwise provided in this subsection by the Commissioner of Social Services, to be effective July first of each year except as otherwise provided in this subsection. Such rates shall be determined on a basis of a reasonable payment for such necessary services, which basis shall take into account as a factor the costs of such services. Cost of such services shall include reasonable costs mandated by collective bargaining agreements with certified collective bargaining agents or other agreements between the employer and employees, provided “employees” shall not include persons employed as managers or chief administrators or required to be licensed as nursing home administrators, and compensation for services rendered by proprietors at prevailing wage rates, as determined by application of principles of accounting as prescribed by said commissioner. Cost of such services shall not include amounts paid by the facilities to employees as salary, or to attorneys or consultants as fees, where the responsibility of the employees, attorneys, or consultants is to persuade or seek to persuade the other employees of the facility to support or oppose unionization. Nothing in this subsection shall prohibit inclusion of amounts paid for legal counsel related to the negotiation of collective bargaining agreements, the settlement of grievances or normal administration of labor relations. The commissioner may, in the commissioner's discretion, allow the inclusion of extraordinary and unanticipated costs of providing services that were incurred to avoid an immediate negative impact on the health and safety of patients. The commissioner may, in the commissioner's discretion, based upon review of a facility's costs, direct care staff to patient ratio and any other related information, revise a facility's rate for any increases or decreases to total licensed capacity of more than ten beds or changes to its number of licensed rest home with nursing supervision beds and chronic and convalescent nursing home beds. The commissioner may, in the commissioner's discretion, revise the rate of a facility that is closing. An interim rate issued for the period during which a facility is closing shall be based on a review of facility costs, the expected duration of the close-down period, the anticipated impact on Medicaid costs, available appropriations and the relationship of the rate requested by the facility to the average Medicaid rate for a close-down period. The commissioner may so revise a facility's rate established for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1993, and thereafter for any bed increases, decreases or changes in licensure effective after October 1, 1989. Effective July 1, 1991, in facilities that have both a chronic and convalescent nursing home and a rest home with nursing supervision, the rate for the rest home with nursing supervision shall not exceed such facility's rate for its chronic and convalescent nursing home. All such facilities for which rates are determined under this subsection shall report on a fiscal year basis ending on September thirtieth. Such report shall be submitted to the commissioner by February fifteenth. Each chronic and convalescent nursing home that receives state funding pursuant to this section shall include in such annual report a profit and loss statement from each related party that receives from such chronic and convalescent nursing home thirty thousand dollars or more per year for goods, fees and services. No cause of action or liability shall arise against the state, the Department of Social Services, any state official or agent for failure to take action based on the information required to be reported under this subsection. The commissioner may reduce the rate in effect for a facility that fails to submit a complete and accurate report on or before February fifteenth by an amount not to exceed ten per cent of such rate. If a licensed residential care home fails to submit a complete and accurate report, the department shall notify such home of the failure and the home shall have thirty days from the date the notice was issued to submit a complete and accurate report. If a licensed residential care home fails to submit a complete and accurate report not later than thirty days after the date of notice, such home may not receive a retroactive rate increase, in the commissioner's discretion. The commissioner shall, annually, on or before April first, report the data contained in the reports of such facilities on the department's Internet web site. For the cost reporting year commencing October 1, 1985, and for subsequent cost reporting years, facilities shall report the cost of using the services of any nursing personnel supplied by a temporary nursing services agency by separating said cost into two categories, the portion of the cost equal to the salary of the employee for whom the nursing personnel supplied by a temporary nursing services agency is substituting shall be considered a nursing cost and any cost in excess of such salary shall be further divided so that seventy-five per cent of the excess cost shall be considered an administrative or general cost and twenty-five per cent of the excess cost shall be considered a nursing cost, provided if the total costs of a facility for nursing personnel supplied by a temporary nursing services agency in any cost year are equal to or exceed fifteen per cent of the total nursing expenditures of the facility for such cost year, no portion of such costs in excess of fifteen per cent shall be classified as administrative or general costs. The commissioner, in determining such rates, shall also take into account the classification of patients or boarders according to special care requirements or classification of the facility according to such factors as facilities and services and such other factors as the commissioner deems reasonable, including anticipated fluctuations in the cost of providing such services. The commissioner may establish a separate rate for a facility or a portion of a facility for traumatic brain injury patients who require extensive care but not acute general hospital care. Such separate rate shall reflect the special care requirements of such patients. If changes in federal or state laws, regulations or standards adopted subsequent to June 30, 1985, result in increased costs or expenditures in an amount exceeding one-half of one per cent of allowable costs for the most recent cost reporting year, the commissioner shall adjust rates and provide payment for any such increased reasonable costs or expenditures within a reasonable period of time retroactive to the date of enforcement. Nothing in this section shall be construed to require the Department of Social Services to adjust rates and provide payment for any increases in costs resulting from an inspection of a facility by the Department of Public Health. Such assistance as the commissioner requires from other state agencies or departments in determining rates shall be made available to the commissioner at the commissioner's request. Payment of the rates established pursuant to this section shall be conditioned on the establishment by such facilities of admissions procedures that conform with this section, section 19a-533 and all other applicable provisions of the law and the provision of equality of treatment to all persons in such facilities. The established rates shall be the maximum amount chargeable by such facilities for care of such beneficiaries, and the acceptance by or on behalf of any such facility of any additional compensation for care of any such beneficiary from any other person or source shall constitute the offense of aiding a beneficiary to obtain aid to which the beneficiary is not entitled and shall be punishable in the same manner as is provided in subsection (b) of section 17b-97 . Notwithstanding any provision of this section, the Commissioner of Social Services may, within available appropriations, provide an interim rate increase for a licensed chronic and convalescent nursing home or a rest home with nursing supervision for rate periods no earlier than April 1, 2004, only if the commissioner determines that the increase is necessary to avoid the filing of a petition for relief under Title 11 of the United States Code; imposition of receivership pursuant to sections 19a-542 and 19a-543 ; or substantial deterioration of the facility's financial condition that may be expected to adversely affect resident care and the continued operation of the facility, and the commissioner determines that the continued operation of the facility is in the best interest of the state. The commissioner shall consider any requests for interim rate increases on file with the department from March 30, 2004, and those submitted subsequently for rate periods no earlier than April 1, 2004. When reviewing an interim rate increase request the commissioner shall, at a minimum, consider: (A) Existing chronic and convalescent nursing home or rest home with nursing supervision utilization in the area and projected bed need; (B) physical plant long-term viability and the ability of the owner or purchaser to implement any necessary property improvements; (C) licensure and certification compliance history; (D) reasonableness of actual and projected expenses; and (E) the ability of the facility to meet wage and benefit costs. No interim rate shall be increased pursuant to this subsection in excess of one hundred fifteen per cent of the median rate for the facility's peer grouping, established pursuant to subdivision (3) of subsection (a) of section 17b-340d , unless recommended by the commissioner and approved by the Secretary of the Office of Policy and Management after consultation with the commissioner. Such median rates shall be published by the Department of Social Services not later than April first of each year. In the event that a facility granted an interim rate increase pursuant to this section is sold or otherwise conveyed for value to an unrelated entity less than five years after the effective date of such rate increase, the rate increase shall be deemed rescinded and the department shall recover an amount equal to the difference between payments made for all affected rate periods and payments that would have been made if the interim rate increase was not granted. The commissioner may seek recovery of such payments from any facility with common ownership. With the approval of the Secretary of the Office of Policy and Management, the commissioner may waive recovery and rescission of the interim rate for good cause shown that is not inconsistent with this section, including, but not limited to, transfers to family members that were made for no value. The commissioner shall provide written quarterly reports to the joint standing committees of the General Assembly having cognizance of matters relating to aging, human services and appropriations and the budgets of state agencies, that identify each facility requesting an interim rate increase, the amount of the requested rate increase for each facility, the action taken by the commissioner and the secretary pursuant to this subsection, and estimates of the additional cost to the state for each approved interim rate increase. Nothing in this subsection shall prohibit the commissioner from increasing the rate of a licensed chronic and convalescent nursing home or a rest home with nursing supervision for allowable costs associated with facility capital improvements or increasing the rate in case of a sale of a licensed chronic and convalescent nursing home or a rest home with nursing supervision if receivership has been imposed on such home. For purposes of this section, “temporary nursing services agency” and “nursing personnel” have the same meaning as provided in section 19a-118 .\n\n(b) The Commissioner of Social Services may implement policies and procedures as necessary to carry out the provisions of this section while in the process of adopting the policies and procedures as regulations, provided notice of intent to adopt the regulations is published in accordance with the provisions of section 17b-10 not later than twenty days after the date of implementation.\n\n(c) No facility subject to the requirements of this section shall accept payment in excess of the rate set by the commissioner pursuant to subsection (a) of this section for any medical assistance patient from this or any other state. No facility shall accept payment in excess of the reasonable and necessary costs of other allowable services as specified by the commissioner pursuant to the regulations adopted under subsection (b) of this section for any public assistance patient from this or any other state. Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection, the commissioner may authorize a facility to accept payment in excess of the rate paid for a medical assistance patient in this state for a patient who receives medical assistance from another state.\n\n(d) In any instance where the Commissioner of Social Services finds that a facility subject to the requirements of this section is accepting payment for a medical assistance beneficiary in violation of subsection (c) of this section, the commissioner shall proceed to recover through the rate set for the facility any sum in excess of the stipulated per diem and other allowable costs, as provided for in regulations adopted pursuant to subsections (a) and (b) of this section. The commissioner shall make the recovery prospectively at the time of the next annual rate redetermination.\n\n(e) Except as provided in this subsection, the provisions of subsections (c) and (d) of this section shall not apply to any facility subject to the requirements of this section, which on October 1, 1981, (1) was accepting payments from the commissioner in accordance with the provisions of subsection (a) of this section, (2) was accepting medical assistance payments from another state for at least twenty per cent of its patients, and (3) had not notified the commissioner of any intent to terminate its provider agreement, in accordance with section 17b-271 , provided no patient residing in any such facility on May 22, 1984, shall be removed from such facility for purposes of meeting the requirements of this subsection. If the commissioner finds that the number of beds available to medical assistance patients from this state in any such facility is less than fifteen per cent the provisions of subsections (c) and (d) of this section shall apply to that number of beds which is less than said percentage.\n\n(f) For the fiscal years ending on or before June 30, 2022, rates for nursing home facilities shall be set in accordance with this subsection. On and after July 1, 2022, such rates shall be set in accordance with section 17b-340d . For the fiscal year ending June 30, 1992, the rates paid by or for persons aided or cared for by the state or any town in this state to facilities for room, board and services specified in licensing regulations issued by the licensing agency, except intermediate care facilities for individuals with intellectual disabilities and residential care homes, shall be based on the cost year ending September 30, 1989. For the fiscal years ending June 30, 1993, and June 30, 1994, such rates shall be based on the cost year ending September 30, 1990. Such rates shall be determined by the Commissioner of Social Services in accordance with this section and the regulations of Connecticut state agencies promulgated by the commissioner and in effect on April 1, 1991, except that:\n\n(1) Allowable costs shall be divided into the following five cost components: (A) Direct costs, which shall include salaries for nursing personnel, related fringe benefits and costs for nursing personnel supplied by a temporary nursing services agency; (B) indirect costs, which shall include professional fees, dietary expenses, housekeeping expenses, laundry expenses, supplies related to patient care, salaries for indirect care personnel and related fringe benefits; (C) fair rent, which shall be defined in accordance with subsection (f) of section 17-311-52 of the regulations of Connecticut state agencies; (D) capital-related costs, which shall include property taxes, insurance expenses, equipment leases and equipment depreciation; and (E) administrative and general costs, which shall include (i) maintenance and operation of plant expenses, (ii) salaries for administrative and maintenance personnel, and (iii) related fringe benefits. The commissioner may provide a rate adjustment for nonemergency transportation services required by nursing facility residents. Such adjustment shall be a fixed amount determined annually by the commissioner based upon a review of costs and other associated information. Allowable costs shall not include costs for ancillary services payable under Part B of the Medicare program.\n\n(2) Two geographic peer groupings of facilities shall be established for each level of care, as defined by the Department of Social Services for the determination of rates, for the purpose of determining allowable direct costs. One peer grouping shall be comprised of those facilities located in Fairfield County. The other peer grouping shall be comprised of facilities located in all other counties.\n\n(3) For the fiscal year ending June 30, 1992, per diem maximum allowable costs for each cost component shall be as follows: For direct costs, the maximum shall be equal to one hundred forty per cent of the median allowable cost of that peer grouping; for indirect costs, the maximum shall be equal to one hundred thirty per cent of the state-wide median allowable cost; for fair rent, the amount shall be calculated utilizing the amount approved by the Office of Health Care Access pursuant to section 19a-638 ; for capital-related costs, there shall be no maximum; and for administrative and general costs, the maximum shall be equal to one hundred twenty-five per cent of the state-wide median allowable cost.

For the fiscal year ending June 30, 1995, per diem maximum allowable costs for each cost component shall be as follows: For direct costs, the maximum shall be equal to one hundred thirty-five per cent of the median allowable cost of that peer grouping; for indirect costs, the maximum shall be equal to one hundred twenty per cent of the state-wide median allowable cost; for fair rent, the amount shall be calculated utilizing the amount approved by the Office of Health Care Access pursuant to section 19a-638 ; for capital-related costs, there shall be no maximum; and for administrative and general costs the maximum shall be equal to one hundred five per cent of the state-wide median allowable cost. For the fiscal year ending June 30, 1996, and any succeeding fiscal year, except for the fiscal years ending June 30, 2000, and June 30, 2001, for facilities with an interim rate in one or both periods, per diem maximum allowable costs for each cost component shall be as follows: For direct costs, the maximum shall be equal to one hundred thirty-five per cent of the median allowable cost of that peer grouping; for indirect costs, the maximum shall be equal to one hundred fifteen per cent of the state-wide median allowable cost; for fair rent, the amount shall be calculated utilizing the amount approved pursuant to section 19a-638 ; for capital-related costs, there shall be no maximum; and for administrative and general costs the maximum shall be equal to the state-wide median allowable cost.

Costs in excess of the maximum amounts established under this subsection shall not be recognized as allowable costs, except that the Commissioner of Social Services (A) may allow costs in excess of maximum amounts for any facility with patient days covered by Medicare, including days requiring coinsurance, in excess of twelve per cent of annual patient days which also has patient days covered by Medicaid in excess of fifty per cent of annual patient days; (B) may establish a pilot program whereby costs in excess of maximum amounts shall be allowed for beds in a nursing home which has a managed care program and is affiliated with a hospital licensed under chapter 368v; and (C) may establish rates whereby allowable costs may exceed such maximum amounts for beds approved on or after July 1, 1991, which are restricted to use by patients with acquired immune deficiency syndrome or traumatic brain injury.\n\n(4) For the fiscal year ending June 30, 1992, (A) no facility shall receive a rate that is less than the rate it received for the rate year ending June 30, 1991; (B) no facility whose rate, if determined pursuant to this subsection, would exceed one hundred twenty per cent of the state-wide median rate, as determined pursuant to this subsection, shall receive a rate which is five and one-half per cent more than the rate it received for the rate year ending June 30, 1991; and (C) no facility whose rate, if determined pursuant to this subsection, would be less than one hundred twenty per cent of the state-wide median rate, as determined pursuant to this subsection, shall receive a rate which is six and one-half per cent more than the rate it received for the rate year ending June 30, 1991. For the fiscal year ending June 30, 1993, no facility shall receive a rate that is less than the rate it received for the rate year ending June 30, 1992, or six per cent more than the rate it received for the rate year ending June 30, 1992.

For the fiscal year ending June 30, 1995, no facility shall receive a rate that is more than five per cent less than the rate it received for the rate year ending June 30, 1994, or six per cent more than the rate it received for the rate year ending June 30, 1994.

Effective upon receipt of all the necessary federal approvals to secure federal financial participation matching funds associated with the rate increase provided in this subdivision, but in no event earlier than July 1, 2005, and provided the user fee imposed under section 17b-320 is required to be collected, for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2006, the department shall compute the rate for each facility based upon its 2003 cost report filing or a subsequent cost year filing for facilities having an interim rate for the period ending June 30, 2005, as provided under section 17-311-55 of the regulations of Connecticut state agencies. For each facility not having an interim rate for the period ending June 30, 2005, the rate for the period ending June 30, 2006, shall be determined beginning with the higher of the computed rate based upon its 2003 cost report filing or the rate in effect for the period ending June 30, 2005. Such rate shall then be increased by eleven dollars and eighty cents per day except that in no event shall the rate for the period ending June 30, 2006, be thirty-two dollars more than the rate in effect for the period ending June 30, 2005, and for any facility with a rate below one hundred ninety-five dollars per day for the period ending June 30, 2005, such rate for the period ending June 30, 2006, shall not be greater than two hundred seventeen dollars and forty-three cents per day and for any facility with a rate equal to or greater than one hundred ninety-five dollars per day for the period ending June 30, 2005, such rate for the period ending June 30, 2006, shall not exceed the rate in effect for the period ending June 30, 2005, increased by eleven and one-half per cent. For each facility with an interim rate for the period ending June 30, 2005, the interim replacement rate for the period ending June 30, 2006, shall not exceed the rate in effect for the period ending June 30, 2005, increased by eleven dollars and eighty cents per day plus the per day cost of the user fee payments made pursuant to section 17b-320 divided by annual resident service days, except for any facility with an interim rate below one hundred ninety-five dollars per day for the period ending June 30, 2005, the interim replacement rate for the period ending June 30, 2006, shall not be greater than two hundred seventeen dollars and forty-three cents per day and for any facility with an interim rate equal to or greater than one hundred ninety-five dollars per day for the period ending June 30, 2005, the interim replacement rate for the period ending June 30, 2006, shall not exceed the rate in effect for the period ending June 30, 2005, increased by eleven and one-half per cent. Such July 1, 2005, rate adjustments shall remain in effect unless (i) the federal financial participation matching funds associated with the rate increase are no longer available; or (ii) the user fee created pursuant to section 17b-320 is not in effect. For the fiscal year ending June 30, 2007, each facility shall receive a rate that is three per cent greater than the rate in effect for the period ending June 30, 2006, except any facility that would have been issued a lower rate effective July 1, 2006, than for the rate period ending June 30, 2006, due to interim rate status or agreement with the department, shall be issued such lower rate effective July 1, 2006. For the fiscal year ending June 30, 2008, each facility shall receive a rate that is two and nine-tenths per cent greater than the rate in effect for the period ending June 30, 2007, except any facility that would have been issued a lower rate effective July 1, 2007, than for the rate period ending June 30, 2007, due to interim rate status or agreement with the department, shall be issued such lower rate effective July 1, 2007.

For the fiscal year ending June 30, 2018, the department shall determine facility rates based upon 2016 cost report filings subject to the provisions of this section and applicable regulations, provided no facility shall receive a rate that is higher than the rate in effect on December 31, 2016, and no facility shall receive a rate that is more than two per cent lower than the rate in effect on December 31, 2016. For the fiscal year ending June 30, 2019, no facility shall receive a rate that is higher than the rate in effect on June 30, 2018, except the rate paid to a facility may be higher than the rate paid to the facility for the period ending June 30, 2018, if the commissioner provides, within available appropriations, pro rata fair rent increases, which may, at the discretion of the commissioner, include increases for facilities which have undergone a material change in circumstances related to fair rent additions or moveable equipment placed in service in the cost report year ending September 30, 2017, and not otherwise included in rates issued. For the fiscal year ending June 30, 2020, the department shall determine facility rates based upon 2018 cost report filings subject to the provisions of this section, adjusted to reflect any rate increases provided after the cost report year ending September 30, 2018, and applicable regulations, provided no facility shall receive a rate that is higher than the rate in effect on June 30, 2019, except the rate paid to a facility may be higher than the rate paid to the facility for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2019, if the commissioner provides, within available appropriations, pro rata fair rent increases, which may, at the discretion of the commissioner, include increases for facilities which have undergone a material change in circumstances related to fair rent additions in the cost report year ending September 30, 2018, and are not otherwise included in rates issued. For the fiscal year ending June 30, 2020, no facility shall receive a rate that is more than two per cent lower than the rate in effect on June 30, 2019, unless the facility has an occupancy level of less than seventy per cent, as reported in the 2018 cost report, or an overall rating on Medicare's Nursing Home Compare of one star for the three most recent reporting periods as of July 1, 2019, unless the facility is under an interim rate due to new ownership. For the fiscal year ending June 30, 2021, no facility shall receive a rate that is higher than the rate in effect on June 30, 2020, except the rate paid to a facility may be higher than the rate paid to the facility for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2020, if the commissioner provides, within available appropriations, pro rata fair rent increases, which may, at the discretion of the commissioner, include increases for facilities which have undergone a material change in circumstances related to fair rent additions in the cost report year ending September 30, 2019, and are not otherwise included in rates issued. The Commissioner of Social Services shall add fair rent increases to any other rate increases established pursuant to this subdivision for a facility which has undergone a material change in circumstances related to fair rent, except for the fiscal years ending June 30, 2010, June 30, 2011, and June 30, 2012, such fair rent increases shall only be provided to facilities with an approved certificate of need pursuant to section 17b-352 , 17b-353 , 17b-354 or 17b-355 . For the fiscal year ending June 30, 2013, the commissioner may, within available appropriations, provide pro rata fair rent increases for facilities which have undergone a material change in circumstances related to fair rent additions placed in service in cost report years ending September 30, 2008, to September 30, 2011, inclusive, and not otherwise included in rates issued. For the fiscal years ending June 30, 2014, and June 30, 2015, the commissioner may, within available appropriations, provide pro rata fair rent increases, which may include moveable equipment at the discretion of the commissioner, for facilities which have undergone a material change in circumstances related to fair rent additions or moveable equipment placed in service in cost report years ending September 30, 2012, and September 30, 2013, and not otherwise included in rates issued. The commissioner shall add fair rent increases associated with an approved certificate of need pursuant to section 17b-352 , 17b-353 , 17b-354 or 17b-355 . Interim rates may take into account reasonable costs incurred by a facility, including wages and benefits. Notwithstanding the provisions of this section, the Commissioner of Social Services may, subject to available appropriations, increase or decrease rates issued to licensed chronic and convalescent nursing homes and licensed rest homes with nursing supervision. Notwithstanding any provision of this section, the Commissioner of Social Services shall, effective July 1, 2015, within available appropriations, adjust facility rates in accordance with the application of standard accounting principles as prescribed by the commissioner, for each facility subject to subsection (a) of this section. Such adjustment shall provide a pro-rata increase based on direct and indirect care employee salaries reported in the 2014 annual cost report, and adjusted to reflect subsequent salary increases, to reflect reasonable costs mandated by collective bargaining agreements with certified collective bargaining agents, or otherwise provided by a facility to its employees. For purposes of this subsection, “employee” shall not include a person employed as a facility's manager, chief administrator, a person required to be licensed as a nursing home administrator or any individual who receives compensation for services pursuant to a contractual arrangement and who is not directly employed by the facility. The commissioner may establish an upper limit for reasonable costs associated with salary adjustments beyond which the adjustment shall not apply. Nothing in this section shall require the commissioner to distribute such adjustments in a way that jeopardizes anticipated federal reimbursement. Facilities that receive such adjustment but do not provide increases in employee salaries as described in this subsection on or before July 31, 2015, may be subject to a rate decrease in the same amount as the adjustment by the commissioner. Of the amount appropriated for this purpose, no more than nine million dollars shall go to increases based on reasonable costs mandated by collective bargaining agreements. Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection, and section 17b-340d , effective July 1, 2019, October 1, 2020, January 1, 2021, July 1, 2021, and July 1, 2022, the commissioner shall, within available appropriations, increase rates for the purpose of wage and benefit enhancements for facility employees. The commissioner shall adjust the rate paid to the facility in the form of a rate adjustment to reflect any rate increases paid after the cost report year ending September 30, 2018. Facilities that receive a rate adjustment for the purpose of wage and benefit enhancements but do not provide increases in employee salaries as described in this subsection on or before September 30, 2019, October 31, 2020, January 31, 2021, July 31, 2021, and July 31, 2022, respectively, may be subject to a rate decrease in the same amount as the adjustment by the commissioner.\n\n(5) For the purpose of determining allowable fair rent, a facility with allowable fair rent less than the twenty-fifth percentile of the state-wide allowable fair rent shall be reimbursed as having allowable fair rent equal to the twenty-fifth percentile of the state-wide allowable fair rent, provided for the fiscal years ending June 30, 1996, and June 30, 1997, the reimbursement may not exceed the twenty-fifth percentile of the state-wide allowable fair rent for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1995. On and after July 1, 1998, the Commissioner of Social Services may allow minimum fair rent as the basis upon which reimbursement associated with improvements to real property is added. Beginning with the fiscal year ending June 30, 1996, any facility with a rate of return on real property other than land in excess of eleven per cent shall have such allowance revised to eleven per cent. Any facility or its related realty affiliate which finances or refinances debt through bonds issued by the State of Connecticut Health and Education Facilities Authority shall report the terms and conditions of such financing or refinancing to the Commissioner of Social Services within thirty days of completing such financing or refinancing. The Commissioner of Social Services may revise the facility's fair rent component of its rate to reflect any financial benefit the facility or its related realty affiliate received as a result of such financing or refinancing, including but not limited to, reductions in the amount of debt service payments or period of debt repayment. The commissioner shall allow actual debt service costs for bonds issued by the State of Connecticut Health and Educational Facilities Authority if such costs do not exceed property costs allowed pursuant to subsection (f) of section 17-311-52 of the regulations of Connecticut state agencies, provided the commissioner may allow higher debt service costs for such bonds for good cause. For facilities which first open on or after October 1, 1992, the commissioner shall determine allowable fair rent for real property other than land based on the rate of return for the cost year in which such bonds were issued. The financial benefit resulting from a facility financing or refinancing debt through such bonds shall be shared between the state and the facility to an extent determined by the commissioner on a case-by-case basis and shall be reflected in an adjustment to the facility's allowable fair rent.\n\n(6) A facility shall receive cost efficiency adjustments for indirect costs and for administrative and general costs if such costs are below the state-wide median costs. The cost efficiency adjustments shall equal twenty-five per cent of the difference between allowable reported costs and the applicable median allowable cost established pursuant to this subdivision.\n\n(7) For the fiscal year ending June 30, 1992, allowable operating costs, excluding fair rent, shall be inflated using the Regional Data Resources Incorporated McGraw-Hill Health Care Costs: Consumer Price Index (all urban) - All Items minus one and one-half per cent. For the fiscal year ending June 30, 1993, allowable operating costs, excluding fair rent, shall be inflated using the Regional Data Resources Incorporated McGraw-Hill Health Care Costs: Consumer Price Index (all urban) - All Items minus one and three-quarters per cent. For the fiscal years ending June 30, 1994, and June 30, 1995, allowable operating costs, excluding fair rent, shall be inflated using the Regional Data Resources Incorporated McGraw-Hill Health Care Costs: Consumer Price Index (all urban) - All Items minus two per cent. For the fiscal year ending June 30, 1996, allowable operating costs, excluding fair rent, shall be inflated using the Regional Data Resources Incorporated McGraw-Hill Health Care Costs: Consumer Price Index (all urban) - All Items minus two and one-half per cent. For the fiscal year ending June 30, 1997, allowable operating costs, excluding fair rent, shall be inflated using the Regional Data Resources Incorporated McGraw-Hill Health Care Costs: Consumer Price Index (all urban) - All Items minus three and one-half per cent. For the fiscal year ending June 30, 1992, and any succeeding fiscal year, allowable fair rent shall be those reported in the annual report of long-term care facilities for the cost year ending the immediately preceding September thirtieth. The inflation index to be used pursuant to this subsection shall be computed to reflect inflation between the midpoint of the cost year through the midpoint of the rate year. The Department of Social Services shall study methods of reimbursement for fair rent and shall report its findings and recommendations to the joint standing committee of the General Assembly having cognizance of matters relating to human services on or before January 15, 1993.\n\n(8) On and after July 1, 1994, costs shall be rebased no more frequently than every two years and no less frequently than every four years, as determined by the commissioner. The commissioner shall determine whether and to what extent a change in ownership of a facility shall occasion the rebasing of the facility's costs.\n\n(9) The method of establishing rates for new facilities shall be determined by the commissioner in accordance with the provisions of this subsection until June 30, 2022.\n\n(10) Rates determined under this section shall comply with federal laws and regulations.\n\n(11) Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection, interim rates issued for facilities on and after July 1, 1991, shall be subject to applicable fiscal year cost component limitations established pursuant to subdivision (3) of this subsection.\n\n(12) A chronic and convalescent nursing home having an ownership affiliation with and operated at the same location as a chronic disease hospital may request that the commissioner approve an exception to applicable rate-setting provisions for chronic and convalescent nursing homes and establish a rate for the fiscal years ending June 30, 1992, and June 30, 1993, in accordance with regulations in effect June 30, 1991. Any such rate shall not exceed one hundred sixty-five per cent of the median rate established for chronic and convalescent nursing homes established under this section for the applicable fiscal year.\n\n(13) For the fiscal year ending June 30, 2014, and any succeeding fiscal year, for purposes of computing minimum allowable patient days, utilization of a facility's certified beds shall be determined at a minimum of ninety per cent of capacity, except for new facilities and facilities which are certified for additional beds which may be permitted a lower occupancy rate for the first three months of operation after the effective date of licensure.\n\n(14) The Commissioner of Social Services shall adjust facility rates from April 1, 1999, to June 30, 1999, inclusive, by a per diem amount representing each facility's allocation of funds appropriated for the purpose of wage, benefit and staffing enhancement. A facility's per diem allocation of such funding shall be computed as follows: (A) The facility's direct and indirect component salary, wage, nursing pool and allocated fringe benefit costs as filed for the 1998 cost report period deemed allowable in accordance with this section and applicable regulations without application of cost component maximums specified in subdivision (3) of this subsection shall be totalled; (B) such total shall be multiplied by the facility's Medicaid utilization based on the 1998 cost report; (C) the resulting amount for the facility shall be divided by the sum of the calculations specified in subparagraphs (A) and (B) of this subdivision for all facilities to determine the facility's percentage share of appropriated wage, benefit and staffing enhancement funding; (D) the facility's percentage share shall be multiplied by the amount of appropriated wage, benefit and staffing enhancement funding to determine the facility's allocated amount; and (E) such allocated amount shall be divided by the number of days of care paid for by Medicaid on an annual basis including days for reserved beds specified in the 1998 cost report to determine the per diem wage and benefit rate adjustment amount. The commissioner may adjust a facility's reported 1998 cost and utilization data for the purposes of determining a facility's share of wage, benefit and staffing enhancement funding when reported 1998 information is not substantially representative of estimated cost and utilization data for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2000, due to special circumstances during the 1998 cost report period including change of ownership with a part year cost filing or reductions in facility capacity due to facility renovation projects. Upon completion of the calculation of the allocation of wage, benefit and staffing enhancement funding, the commissioner shall not adjust the allocations due to revisions submitted to previously filed 1998 annual cost reports. In the event that a facility's rate for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1999, is an interim rate or the rate includes an increase adjustment due to a rate request to the commissioner or other reasons, the commissioner may reduce or withhold the per diem wage, benefit and staffing enhancement allocation computed for the facility. Any enhancement allocations not applied to facility rates shall not be reallocated to other facilities and such unallocated amounts shall be available for the costs associated with interim rates and other Medicaid expenditures. The wage, benefit and staffing enhancement per diem adjustment for the period from April 1, 1999, to June 30, 1999, inclusive, shall also be applied to rates for the fiscal years ending June 30, 2000, and June 30, 2001, except that the commissioner may increase or decrease the adjustment to account for changes in facility capacity or operations. Any facility accepting a rate adjustment for wage, benefit and staffing enhancements shall apply payments made as a result of such rate adjustment for increased allowable employee wage rates and benefits and additional direct and indirect component staffing. Adjustment funding shall not be applied to wage and salary increases provided to the administrator, assistant administrator, owners or related party employees. Enhancement payments may be applied to increases in costs associated with staffing purchased from staffing agencies provided such costs are deemed necessary and reasonable by the commissioner. The commissioner shall compare expenditures for wages, benefits and staffing for the 1998 cost report period to such expenditures in the 1999, 2000 and 2001 cost report periods to verify whether a facility has applied additional payments to specified enhancements. In the event that the commissioner determines that a facility did not apply additional payments to specified enhancements, the commissioner shall recover such amounts from the facility through rate adjustments or other means. The commissioner may require facilities to file cost reporting forms, in addition to the annual cost report, as may be necessary, to verify the appropriate application of wage, benefit and staffing enhancement rate adjustment payments. For the purposes of this subdivision, “Medicaid utilization” means the number of days of care paid for by Medicaid on an annual basis including days for reserved beds as a percentage of total resident days.\n\n(g) The established interim rate to become effective upon sale of any licensed chronic and convalescent home or rest home with nursing supervision for which a receivership has been imposed pursuant to sections 19a-541 to 19a-549 , inclusive, shall not exceed the rate in effect for the facility at the time of the imposition of the receivership, subject to any annual increases permitted by this section, provided the Commissioner of Social Services may, in the commissioner's discretion and after consultation with the receiver, establish an increased rate for the facility if the commissioner, with the approval of the Secretary of the Office of Policy and Management, determines that such higher rate is needed to keep the facility open and to ensure the health, safety and welfare of the residents at such facility.\n\n(h) (1) For the fiscal year ending June 30, 1993, any intermediate care facility for individuals with intellectual disabilities with an operating cost component of its rate in excess of one hundred forty per cent of the median of operating cost components of rates in effect January 1, 1992, shall not receive an operating cost component increase. For the fiscal year ending June 30, 1993, any intermediate care facility for individuals with intellectual disabilities with an operating cost component of its rate that is less than one hundred forty per cent of the median of operating cost components of rates in effect January 1, 1992, shall have an allowance for real wage growth equal to thirty per cent of the increase determined in accordance with subsection (q) of section 17-311-52 of the regulations of Connecticut state agencies, provided such operating cost component shall not exceed one hundred forty per cent of the median of operating cost components in effect January 1, 1992. Any facility with real property other than land placed in service prior to October 1, 1991, shall, for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1995, receive a rate of return on real property equal to the average of the rates of return applied to real property other than land placed in service for the five years preceding October 1, 1993. For the fiscal year ending June 30, 1996, and any succeeding fiscal year, the rate of return on real property for property items shall be revised every five years. The commissioner shall, upon submission of a request, allow actual debt service, comprised of principal and interest, in excess of property costs allowed pursuant to section 17-311-52 of the regulations of Connecticut state agencies, provided such debt service terms and amounts are reasonable in relation to the useful life and the base value of the property. For the fiscal year ending June 30, 1995, and any succeeding fiscal year, the inflation adjustment made in accordance with subsection (p) of section 17-311-52 of the regulations of Connecticut state agencies shall not be applied to real property costs. For the fiscal year ending June 30, 1996, and any succeeding fiscal year, the allowance for real wage growth, as determined in accordance with subsection (q) of section 17-311-52 of the regulations of Connecticut state agencies, shall not be applied. For the fiscal year ending June 30, 1996, and any succeeding fiscal year, no rate shall exceed three hundred seventy-five dollars per day unless the commissioner, in consultation with the Commissioner of Developmental Services, determines after a review of program and management costs, that a rate in excess of this amount is necessary for care and treatment of facility residents. For the fiscal year ending June 30, 2002, rate period, the Commissioner of Social Services shall increase the inflation adjustment for rates made in accordance with subsection (p) of section 17-311-52 of the regulations of Connecticut state agencies to update allowable fiscal year 2000 costs to include a three and one-half per cent inflation factor. For the fiscal year ending June 30, 2003, rate period, the commissioner shall increase the inflation adjustment for rates made in accordance with subsection (p) of section 17-311-52 of the regulations of Connecticut state agencies to update allowable fiscal year 2001 costs to include a one and one-half per cent inflation factor, except that such increase shall be effective November 1, 2002, and such facility rate in effect for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2002, shall be paid for services provided until October 31, 2002, except any facility that would have been issued a lower rate effective July 1, 2002, than for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2002, due to interim rate status or agreement with the department shall be issued such lower rate effective July 1, 2002, and have such rate updated effective November 1, 2002, in accordance with applicable statutes and regulations. For the fiscal year ending June 30, 2004, rates in effect for the period ending June 30, 2003, shall remain in effect, except any facility that would have been issued a lower rate effective July 1, 2003, than for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2003, due to interim rate status or agreement with the department shall be issued such lower rate effective July 1, 2003. For the fiscal year ending June 30, 2005, rates in effect for the period ending June 30, 2004, shall remain in effect until September 30, 2004. Effective October 1, 2004, each facility shall receive a rate that is five per cent greater than the rate in effect September 30, 2004. Effective upon receipt of all the necessary federal approvals to secure federal financial participation matching funds associated with the rate increase provided in subdivision (4) of subsection (f) of this section, but in no event earlier than October 1, 2005, and provided the user fee imposed under section 17b-320 is required to be collected, each facility shall receive a rate that is four per cent more than the rate the facility received in the prior fiscal year, except any facility that would have been issued a lower rate effective October 1, 2005, than for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2005, due to interim rate status or agreement with the department, shall be issued such lower rate effective October 1, 2005. Such rate increase shall remain in effect unless: (A) The federal financial participation matching funds associated with the rate increase are no longer available; or (B) the user fee created pursuant to section 17b-320 is not in effect. For the fiscal year ending June 30, 2007, rates in effect for the period ending June 30, 2006, shall remain in effect until September 30, 2006, except any facility that would have been issued a lower rate effective July 1, 2006, than for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2006, due to interim rate status or agreement with the department, shall be issued such lower rate effective July 1, 2006.

Rate adjustments based on performance on quality metrics will be phased in, beginning July 1, 2022, with a period of reporting only. Effective July 1, 2023, the Department of Social Services shall issue individualized reports annually to each nursing home facility showing the impact to the Medicaid rate for such home based on the quality metrics program.

              "(6) On or after June 30, 2022, the commissioner may, in the commissioner's discretion and within available appropriations, provide pro rata fair rent increases to facilities which have documented fair rent additions placed in service in the most recently filed cost report that are not otherwise included in the rates issued. The commissioner may provide, within available appropriations, pro rata fair rent increases, which may, at the discretion of the commissioner, include increases for facilities which have undergone a material change in circumstances related to fair rent additions in the most recently filed cost report. The commissioner may allow minimum fair rent as the basis upon which reimbursement associated with improvements to real property is added.",
              "(7) For the purpose of determining allowable fair rent, a facility with allowable fair rent less than the twenty-fifth percentile of the state-wide allowable fair rent shall be reimbursed as having allowable fair rent equal to the twenty-fifth percentile of the state-wide allowable fair rent. Any facility with a rate of return on real property other than land in excess of eleven per cent shall have such allowance revised to eleven per cent. Any facility or its related realty affiliate which finances or refinances debt through bonds issued by the Connecticut Health and Education Facilities Authority shall report the terms and conditions of such financing or refinancing to the Commissioner of Social Services not later than thirty days after completing such financing or refinancing. The commissioner may revise the facility's fair rent component of its rate to reflect any financial benefit the facility or its related realty affiliate received as a result of such financing or refinancing. The commissioner shall determine allowable fair rent for real property other than land based on the rate of return for the cost year in which such bonds were issued. The financial benefit resulting from a facility financing or refinancing debt through such bonds shall be shared between the state and the facility to an extent determined by the commissioner on a case-by-case basis and shall be reflected in an adjustment to the facility's allowable fair rent.",
              "(8) A facility shall receive cost efficiency adjustments for indirect costs and for administrative and general costs if such costs are below the state-wide median costs. The cost efficiency adjustments shall equal twenty-five per cent of the difference between allowable reported costs and the applicable median allowable cost established pursuant to subdivision (4) of this subsection.",
              "(9) On and after July 1, 2025, costs shall be rebased no more frequently than every two years and no less frequently than every four years, as determined by the commissioner. There shall be no inflation adjustment during a year in which a facility's rates are rebased. The commissioner shall determine whether and to what extent a change in ownership of a facility shall occasion the rebasing of the facility's costs.",
              "(10) The method of establishing rates for new facilities shall be determined by the commissioner in accordance with the provisions of this subsection.",
              "(11) There shall be no increase to rates based on inflation or any inflationary factor for the fiscal years ending June 30, 2022, and June 30, 2023, unless otherwise authorized under subdivision (1) of this subsection. Notwithstanding section 17-311-52 of the regulations of Connecticut state agencies, for the fiscal years ending June 30, 2024, and June 30, 2025, there shall be no inflationary increases to rates beyond those already factored into the model for the transition to an acuity-based reimbursement system. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this chapter, any subsequent increase to allowable operating costs, excluding fair rent, shall be inflated by the gross domestic product deflator when funding is specifically appropriated for such purposes in the enacted budget. The rate of inflation shall be computed by comparing the most recent rate year to the average of the gross domestic product deflator for the previous four fiscal quarters ending March thirty-first. Any increase to rates based on inflation shall be applied prior to the application of any other budget adjustment factors that may impact such rates.",

After modeling such case-mix adjustments, the Commissioner of Social Services shall evaluate impact on a facility by facility basis and, not later than October 1, 2021, (A) make recommendations to the Secretary of the Office of Policy and Management, and (B) submit a report on the recommendations, in accordance with the provisions of section 11-4a , to the joint standing committees of the General Assembly having cognizance of matters relating to appropriations and the budgets of state agencies and human services on any adjustments needed to facilitate the transition to the new methodology on July 1, 2022. This evaluation may include a review of inflationary allowances, case mix and budget adjustment factors and stop loss and stop gain corridors and the ability to make such adjustments within available appropriations.\n\n(2) Beginning July 1, 2022, facilities will be required to comply with collection and reporting of quality metrics as specified by the Department of Social Services, after consultation with the nursing home industry, consumers, employees and the Department of Public Health. Rate adjustments based on performance on quality metrics will be phased in, beginning July 1, 2022, with a period of reporting only. Effective July 1, 2023, the Department of Social Services shall issue individualized reports annually to each nursing home facility showing the impact to the Medicaid rate for such home based on the quality metrics program. A nursing home facility receiving an individualized quality metrics report may use such report to evaluate the impact of the quality metrics program on said facility's Medicaid reimbursement. Not later than June 30, 2025, the department shall submit a report, in accordance with the provisions of section 11-4a , to the joint standing committees of the General Assembly having cognizance of matters relating to appropriations and the budgets of state agencies and human services on the quality metrics program. Such report shall include information regarding individualized reports and the anticipated impact on nursing homes if the state were to implement a rate withhold on nursing homes that fail to meet certain quality metrics.\n\n(3) Geographic peer groupings of facilities shall be established by the Department of Social Services pursuant to regulations adopted in accordance with subsection (b) of this section.\n\n(4) Allowable costs shall be divided into the following five cost components: (A) Direct costs, which shall include salaries for nursing personnel, related fringe benefits and costs for nursing personnel supplied by a temporary nursing services agency; (B) indirect costs, which shall include professional fees, dietary expenses, housekeeping expenses, laundry expenses, supplies related to patient care, salaries for indirect care personnel and related fringe benefits; (C) fair rent, which shall be defined in regulations adopted in accordance with subsection (b) of this section; (D) capital-related costs, which shall include property taxes, insurance expenses, equipment leases and equipment depreciation; and (E) administrative and general costs, which shall include maintenance and operation of plant expenses, salaries for administrative and maintenance personnel and related fringe benefits. For (i) direct costs, the maximum cost shall be equal to one hundred thirty-five per cent of the median allowable cost of that peer grouping; (ii) indirect costs, the maximum cost shall be equal to one hundred fifteen per cent of the state-wide median allowable cost; (iii) fair rent, the amount shall be calculated utilizing the amount approved pursuant to section 17b-353 ; (iv) capital-related costs, there shall be no maximum; and (v) administrative and general costs, the maximum shall be equal to the state-wide median allowable cost. For purposes of this subdivision, “temporary nursing services agency” and “nursing personnel” have the same meaning as provided in section 19a-118 .\n\n(5) Costs in excess of the maximum amounts established under this subsection shall not be recognized as allowable costs, except that the commissioner may establish rates whereby allowable costs may exceed such maximum amounts for beds which are restricted to use by patients with acquired immune deficiency syndrome, traumatic brain injury or other specialized services.\n\n(6) On or after June 30, 2022, the commissioner may, in the commissioner's discretion and within available appropriations, provide pro rata fair rent increases to facilities which have documented fair rent additions placed in service in the most recently filed cost report that are not otherwise included in the rates issued. The commissioner may provide, within available appropriations, pro rata fair rent increases, which may, at the discretion of the commissioner, include increases for facilities which have undergone a material change in circumstances related to fair rent additions in the most recently filed cost report. The commissioner may allow minimum fair rent as the basis upon which reimbursement associated with improvements to real property is added.\n\n(7) For the purpose of determining allowable fair rent, a facility with allowable fair rent less than the twenty-fifth percentile of the state-wide allowable fair rent shall be reimbursed as having allowable fair rent equal to the twenty-fifth percentile of the state-wide allowable fair rent. Any facility with a rate of return on real property other than land in excess of eleven per cent shall have such allowance revised to eleven per cent. Any facility or its related realty affiliate which finances or refinances debt through bonds issued by the Connecticut Health and Education Facilities Authority shall report the terms and conditions of such financing or refinancing to the Commissioner of Social Services not later than thirty days after completing such financing or refinancing. The commissioner may revise the facility's fair rent component of its rate to reflect any financial benefit the facility or its related realty affiliate received as a result of such financing or refinancing. The commissioner shall determine allowable fair rent for real property other than land based on the rate of return for the cost year in which such bonds were issued. The financial benefit resulting from a facility financing or refinancing debt through such bonds shall be shared between the state and the facility to an extent determined by the commissioner on a case-by-case basis and shall be reflected in an adjustment to the facility's allowable fair rent.\n\n(8) A facility shall receive cost efficiency adjustments for indirect costs and for administrative and general costs if such costs are below the state-wide median costs. The cost efficiency adjustments shall equal twenty-five per cent of the difference between allowable reported costs and the applicable median allowable cost established pursuant to subdivision (4) of this subsection.\n\n(9) On and after July 1, 2025, costs shall be rebased no more frequently than every two years and no less frequently than every four years, as determined by the commissioner. There shall be no inflation adjustment during a year in which a facility's rates are rebased. The commissioner shall determine whether and to what extent a change in ownership of a facility shall occasion the rebasing of the facility's costs.\n\n(10) The method of establishing rates for new facilities shall be determined by the commissioner in accordance with the provisions of this subsection.\n\n(11) There shall be no increase to rates based on inflation or any inflationary factor for the fiscal years ending June 30, 2022, and June 30, 2023, unless otherwise authorized under subdivision (1) of this subsection. Notwithstanding section 17-311-52 of the regulations of Connecticut state agencies, for the fiscal years ending June 30, 2024, and June 30, 2025, there shall be no inflationary increases to rates beyond those already factored into the model for the transition to an acuity-based reimbursement system. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this chapter, any subsequent increase to allowable operating costs, excluding fair rent, shall be inflated by the gross domestic product deflator when funding is specifically appropriated for such purposes in the enacted budget. The rate of inflation shall be computed by comparing the most recent rate year to the average of the gross domestic product deflator for the previous four fiscal quarters ending March thirty-first. Any increase to rates based on inflation shall be applied prior to the application of any other budget adjustment factors that may impact such rates.\n\n(12) For purposes of computing minimum allowable patient days, utilization of a facility's certified beds shall be determined at a minimum of ninety per cent of capacity, except for facilities that have undergone a change in ownership, new facilities, and facilities which are certified for additional beds which may be permitted a lower occupancy rate for the first three months of operation after the effective date of licensure.\n\n(13) Rates determined under this section shall comply with federal laws and regulations.\n\n(14) The Commissioner of Social Services may authorize an interim rate for a facility demonstrating circumstances particular to that individual facility impacting facility finances or costs not reflected in the underlying rates.\n\n(b) The Commissioner of Social Services may implement policies as necessary to carry out the provisions of this section while in the process of adopting the policies as regulations, provided that prior to implementation the policies are posted (1) on the eRegulations System established pursuant to section 4-173b , and (2) the Department of Social Services' Internet web site."

              "(a)(1) As used in this section, “self-pay patient” means a patient who is not receiving state or municipal assistance to pay for the cost of care.",
              "(2) The Commissioner of Social Services shall determine annually, after a public hearing, the rates to be charged to self-pay patients in any of the following licensed facilities if the facility does not have a provider agreement with the state to provide services to recipients of benefits obtained through Title XIX of the Social Security Amendments of 1965, except a facility that did not have a provider agreement in effect as of January 1, 1991, or had entered into a limited provider agreement before January 1, 1991: Chronic and convalescent nursing homes, chronic disease hospitals associated with chronic and convalescent nursing homes and rest homes with nursing supervision. Each such facility that does have such a provider agreement, each such facility that did not have a provider agreement in effect as of January 1, 1991, or had entered into a limited provider agreement before January 1, 1991, and each residential care home shall determine its own self-pay rates. Rates determined pursuant to this section shall be effective July 1, 1991, and on July first of each year thereafter through June 30, 1993, and shall be determined for each facility individually, on the basis of payment for the reasonable costs of providing all services. All self-pay patients shall be given notice of a rate increase at least thirty days prior to the effective date of such rate increase. In determining rates to be charged to self-pay patients the commissioner shall: (A) Consider the quality of care provided by each facility, based on information which the Department of Public Health shall provide to the commissioner, and any testimony or information received from other interested parties; and (B) take into account the relevant cost considerations set forth in section 17b-340 and in the regulations adopted in accordance with subsection (a) of section 17b-238 . Such regulations shall include, but not be limited to, the establishment of a formula for allowing profit or an operating surplus, and a fair rate of return on invested capital or equity. Nothing in this section shall authorize the commissioner to set a rate lower than the rate set under section 17b-340 for comparable services. Each facility determining its own self-pay rates shall report such rates to the commissioner upon determination and upon any modification. The commissioner shall document each rate so reported and each rate determined for a facility by the commissioner pursuant to this section. Each facility shall charge any self-pay patient who is insured under a long-term care insurance policy which is precertified pursuant to section 38a-475 a rate which is at least five per cent less than the rate charged other self-pay patients. On and after April 1, 2008, each facility shall charge self-pay patients a per diem rate and not a monthly rate.",
              "(b) Any hospital, home or any self-pay patient or his guardian or conservator aggrieved by said commissioner's decision regarding the rates to be charged to self-pay patients may obtain, by written request to said commissioner, a hearing on all items of aggrievement in accordance with sections 4-176e to 4-181a , inclusive, if the request is made not later than ten days after written notice of the decision is provided by said commissioner to such home or hospital. Upon receipt of such notice concerning the rate decision, the home or hospital shall immediately give written notice of said commissioner's decision to any patient affected or his guardian or conservator.",
              "(c) In the event of an unforeseen or material change in circumstances such hospital or home may submit an application for a rate increase at any time in a form and manner prescribed by the commissioner by regulations adopted in accordance with subsection (a) of section 17b-238 . All self-pay patients shall be given notice of an application for a rate increase as soon as possible after receipt of such application by the commissioner, but in no case shall such notice be provided less than ten days prior to the effective date of such increase. The commissioner may approve, modify, or deny such rate increase request with or without a public hearing thereon not less than ten nor more than thirty days after receipt of such request. Notice of such decision shall be given immediately to the hospital or home by certified mail and to the public by publication in a newspaper having a circulation in the area affected. If such rate increase request is denied, modified or approved without a public hearing the applicant or any member of the public may request such a hearing not later than thirty days after the date of such decision, in which case the commissioner shall hold a public hearing. Any public hearing provided by this section shall be held not less than ten nor more than thirty days after receipt of the request for a rate increase or the request for a hearing by the applicant or a member of the public. Notice of the hearing shall be given to the hospital or home by certified mail and to the public, by publication in a newspaper having a circulation in the area affected, at least one week prior to such hearing. Such hearing shall be held, at the discretion of the commissioner, in Hartford or in the area served by such hospital or home. The commissioner shall require from such hospital or home such information, data, records, studies and evaluations as he considers necessary to determine the need for such increases in accordance with the regulations adopted pursuant to section 17b-238 . Such proposed increases shall take effect thirty days after such hearing or thirty days after the receipt of any data requested by the commissioner, whichever is later, unless within such period the commissioner denies the requested increase or approves such percentage of the increase as he feels is justified. If no hearing is held or requested the commissioner's decision shall take effect thirty days after the date of such decision. The applicant shall have the burden of proof that an increase is warranted.",
              "(d) Any party aggrieved by said commissioner's decision after a hearing conducted pursuant to subsection (b) or (c), may appeal therefrom in accordance with the provisions of section 4-183 , except venue shall be in the judicial district in which the home or hospital is located. Such appeal shall have precedence in respect to order of trial over all other cases except writs of habeas corpus, actions brought by or on behalf of the state, including informations on the relation of private individuals, and appeals from awards or decisions of administrative law judges.",
              "(e) The Superior Court, on application of the Commissioner of Social Services or the Attorney General, may enforce any determination made by the commissioner, pursuant to subsection (a), (b), or (c) of this section, by appropriate decree or process, including but not limited to the following: (1) An order requiring a hospital or home to cease and desist from charging a self-pay patient a rate in excess of the allowable rate set pursuant to this section; and (2) an order that the hospital or home refund to a self-pay patient any amount paid in excess of the allowable rate set pursuant to this section. The decree or process shall issue upon proof of the allowable rate established pursuant to this section and proof that a self-pay patient has paid any amount in excess of the allowable rate established pursuant to this section, as required by the hospital or home."

            "text": "(a)(1) As used in this section, “self-pay patient” means a patient who is not receiving state or municipal assistance to pay for the cost of care.\n\n(2) The Commissioner of Social Services shall determine annually, after a public hearing, the rates to be charged to self-pay patients in any of the following licensed facilities if the facility does not have a provider agreement with the state to provide services to recipients of benefits obtained through Title XIX of the Social Security Amendments of 1965, except a facility that did not have a provider agreement in effect as of January 1, 1991, or had entered into a limited provider agreement before January 1, 1991: Chronic and convalescent nursing homes, chronic disease hospitals associated with chronic and convalescent nursing homes and rest homes with nursing supervision. Each such facility that does have such a provider agreement, each such facility that did not have a provider agreement in effect as of January 1, 1991, or had entered into a limited provider agreement before January 1, 1991, and each residential care home shall determine its own self-pay rates. Rates determined pursuant to this section shall be effective July 1, 1991, and on July first of each year thereafter through June 30, 1993, and shall be determined for each facility individually, on the basis of payment for the reasonable costs of providing all services. All self-pay patients shall be given notice of a rate increase at least thirty days prior to the effective date of such rate increase. In determining rates to be charged to self-pay patients the commissioner shall: (A) Consider the quality of care provided by each facility, based on information which the Department of Public Health shall provide to the commissioner, and any testimony or information received from other interested parties; and (B) take into account the relevant cost considerations set forth in section 17b-340 and in the regulations adopted in accordance with subsection (a) of section 17b-238 . Such regulations shall include, but not be limited to, the establishment of a formula for allowing profit or an operating surplus, and a fair rate of return on invested capital or equity. Nothing in this section shall authorize the commissioner to set a rate lower than the rate set under section 17b-340 for comparable services. Each facility determining its own self-pay rates shall report such rates to the commissioner upon determination and upon any modification. The commissioner shall document each rate so reported and each rate determined for a facility by the commissioner pursuant to this section. Each facility shall charge any self-pay patient who is insured under a long-term care insurance policy which is precertified pursuant to section 38a-475 a rate which is at least five per cent less than the rate charged other self-pay patients. On and after April 1, 2008, each facility shall charge self-pay patients a per diem rate and not a monthly rate.\n\n(b) Any hospital, home or any self-pay patient or his guardian or conservator aggrieved by said commissioner's decision regarding the rates to be charged to self-pay patients may obtain, by written request to said commissioner, a hearing on all items of aggrievement in accordance with sections 4-176e to 4-181a , inclusive, if the request is made not later than ten days after written notice of the decision is provided by said commissioner to such home or hospital. Upon receipt of such notice concerning the rate decision, the home or hospital shall immediately give written notice of said commissioner's decision to any patient affected or his guardian or conservator.\n\n(c) In the event of an unforeseen or material change in circumstances such hospital or home may submit an application for a rate increase at any time in a form and manner prescribed by the commissioner by regulations adopted in accordance with subsection (a) of section 17b-238 . All self-pay patients shall be given notice of an application for a rate increase as soon as possible after receipt of such application by the commissioner, but in no case shall such notice be provided less than ten days prior to the effective date of such increase. The commissioner may approve, modify, or deny such rate increase request with or without a public hearing thereon not less than ten nor more than thirty days after receipt of such request. Notice of such decision shall be given immediately to the hospital or home by certified mail and to the public by publication in a newspaper having a circulation in the area affected. If such rate increase request is denied, modified or approved without a public hearing the applicant or any member of the public may request such a hearing not later than thirty days after the date of such decision, in which case the commissioner shall hold a public hearing. Any public hearing provided by this section shall be held not less than ten nor more than thirty days after receipt of the request for a rate increase or the request for a hearing by the applicant or a member of the public. Notice of the hearing shall be given to the hospital or home by certified mail and to the public, by publication in a newspaper having a circulation in the area affected, at least one week prior to such hearing. Such hearing shall be held, at the discretion of the commissioner, in Hartford or in the area served by such hospital or home. The commissioner shall require from such hospital or home such information, data, records, studies and evaluations as he considers necessary to determine the need for such increases in accordance with the regulations adopted pursuant to section 17b-238 . Such proposed increases shall take effect thirty days after such hearing or thirty days after the receipt of any data requested by the commissioner, whichever is later, unless within such period the commissioner denies the requested increase or approves such percentage of the increase as he feels is justified. If no hearing is held or requested the commissioner's decision shall take effect thirty days after the date of such decision. The applicant shall have the burden of proof that an increase is warranted.\n\n(d) Any party aggrieved by said commissioner's decision after a hearing conducted pursuant to subsection (b) or (c), may appeal therefrom in accordance with the provisions of section 4-183 , except venue shall be in the judicial district in which the home or hospital is located. Such appeal shall have precedence in respect to order of trial over all other cases except writs of habeas corpus, actions brought by or on behalf of the state, including informations on the relation of private individuals, and appeals from awards or decisions of administrative law judges.\n\n(e) The Superior Court, on application of the Commissioner of Social Services or the Attorney General, may enforce any determination made by the commissioner, pursuant to subsection (a), (b), or (c) of this section, by appropriate decree or process, including but not limited to the following: (1) An order requiring a hospital or home to cease and desist from charging a self-pay patient a rate in excess of the allowable rate set pursuant to this section; and (2) an order that the hospital or home refund to a self-pay patient any amount paid in excess of the allowable rate set pursuant to this section. The decree or process shall issue upon proof of the allowable rate established pursuant to this section and proof that a self-pay patient has paid any amount in excess of the allowable rate established pursuant to this section, as required by the hospital or home."

              "(a) The Commissioner of Social Services shall administer the Connecticut home-care program for the elderly state-wide in order to prevent the institutionalization of elderly persons who (1) are recipients of medical assistance, (2) are eligible for such assistance, (3) would be eligible for medical assistance if residing in a nursing facility, or (4) meet the criteria for the state-funded portion of the program under subsection (j) of this section. For purposes of this section, “long-term care facility” means a facility that has been federally certified as a skilled nursing facility or intermediate care facility. The commissioner shall make any revisions in the state Medicaid plan required by Title XIX of the Social Security Act prior to implementing the program. The program shall be structured so that the net cost to the state for long-term facility care in combination with the services under the program shall not exceed the net cost the state would have incurred without the program. The commissioner shall investigate the possibility of receiving federal funds for the program and shall apply for any necessary federal waivers. A recipient of services under the program, and the estate and legally liable relatives of the recipient, shall be responsible for reimbursement to the state for such services to the same extent required of a recipient of assistance under the state supplement program, medical assistance program, temporary family assistance program or supplemental nutrition assistance program. Only a United States citizen or a noncitizen who meets the citizenship requirements for eligibility under the Medicaid program shall be eligible for home-care services under this section, except a qualified alien, as defined in Section 431 of Public Law 104-193, admitted into the United States on or after August 22, 1996, or other lawfully residing immigrant alien determined eligible for services under this section prior to July 1, 1997, shall remain eligible for such services. Qualified aliens or other lawfully residing immigrant aliens not determined eligible prior to July 1, 1997, shall be eligible for services under this section subsequent to six months from establishing residency. Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection, any qualified alien or other lawfully residing immigrant alien or alien who formerly held the status of permanently residing under color of law who is a victim of domestic violence or who has intellectual disability shall be eligible for assistance pursuant to this section. Qualified aliens, as defined in Section 431 of Public Law 104-193, or other lawfully residing immigrant aliens or aliens who formerly held the status of permanently residing under color of law shall be eligible for services under this section provided other conditions of eligibility are met.",
              "(b) The commissioner shall solicit bids through a competitive process and shall contract with an access agency, approved by the Office of Policy and Management and the Department of Social Services as meeting the requirements for such agency as defined by regulations adopted pursuant to subsection (m) of this section, that submits proposals that meet or exceed the minimum bid requirements. In addition to such contracts, the commissioner may use department staff to provide screening, coordination, assessment and monitoring functions for the program.",
              "(c) The community-based services covered under the program shall include, but not be limited to, services not otherwise available under the state Medicaid plan: (1) Occupational therapy, (2) homemaker services, (3) companion services, (4) meals on wheels, (5) adult day care, (6) transportation, (7) mental health counseling, (8) care management, (9) elderly foster care, (10) minor home modifications, and (11) assisted living services provided in state-funded congregate housing and in other assisted living pilot or demonstration projects established under state law. Personal care assistance services shall be covered under the program to the extent that (A) such services are not available under the Medicaid state plan and are more cost effective on an individual client basis than existing services covered under such plan, and (B) the provision of such services is approved by the federal government. Recipients of state-funded services, pursuant to subsection (i) of this section, and persons who are determined to be functionally eligible for community-based services who have an application for medical assistance pending, or are determined to be presumptively eligible for Medicaid pursuant to subsection (e) of this section, shall have the cost of home health and community-based services covered by the program, provided they comply with all medical assistance application requirements. Access agencies shall not use department funds to purchase community-based services or home health services from themselves or any related parties.",
              "(d) Physicians, hospitals, long-term care facilities and other licensed health care facilities may disclose, and, as a condition of eligibility for the program, elderly persons, their guardians, and relatives shall disclose, upon request from the Department of Social Services, such financial, social and medical information as may be necessary to enable the department or any agency administering the program on behalf of the department to provide services under the program. Long-term care facilities shall supply the Department of Social Services with the names and addresses of all applicants for admission. Any information provided pursuant to this subsection shall be confidential and shall not be disclosed by the department or administering agency.",
              "(e) (1) The Commissioner of Social Services shall, subject to the provisions of subdivisions (2) and (3) of this subsection, establish a presumptive Medicaid eligibility system under which the state shall fund services under the Connecticut home-care program for the elderly for a period of not longer than ninety days for applicants who require a skilled level of nursing care and who are determined to be presumptively eligible for Medicaid coverage. The system shall include, but need not be limited to: (A) The development of a preliminary screening tool by the Department of Social Services to be used by representatives of the access agency selected pursuant to subsection (b) of this section to determine whether an applicant is functionally able to live at home or in a community setting and is likely to be financially eligible for Medicaid; (B) a requirement that the applicant complete a Medicaid application on the date such applicant is preliminarily screened for functional eligibility or not later than ten days after such screening; (C) a determination of presumptive eligibility for eligible applicants by the department and approval of a care plan authorizing home care services not later than ten days after an applicant is successfully screened for eligibility; and (D) a written agreement to be signed by the applicant (i) attesting to the accuracy of financial and other information such applicant provides, (ii) acknowledging that the state shall solely fund services not longer than ninety days after the date on which home care services begin, and (iii) waiving any right to receive continued coverage while awaiting a hearing that is requested in response to the department's determination during or at the end of the presumptive period of eligibility that (I) the applicant is not eligible for Medicaid or (II) the applicant failed to provide information necessary to allow the department to make an eligibility determination. The department shall make a final determination as to Medicaid eligibility for applicants determined to be presumptively eligible for Medicaid coverage not later than the end of the ninety-day period of presumptive eligibility. The department may make such determination prior to the end of such ninety-day period if it receives information indicating that the applicant is not eligible for Medicaid.",
              "(2) To the extent permitted by federal law, the commissioner shall seek any federal waiver or amend the Medicaid state plan as necessary to attempt to secure federal reimbursement for the costs of providing coverage to persons determined to be presumptively eligible for Medicaid coverage. The provisions of this subsection and any other provision of this section relating to the establishment of a presumptive Medicaid eligibility system, including, but not limited to, such provisions located in subsections (c), (g) and (m), shall not be effective until the commissioner secures such federal reimbursement through a federal waiver or Medicaid state plan amendment.",
              "(3) Not less than two years after the date of the establishment of a presumptive Medicaid eligibility system pursuant to the provisions of this subsection, the commissioner may, in the commissioner's discretion, discontinue the system if the commissioner determines that the system is not cost effective.",
              "(f) The commissioner may require long-term care facilities to inform applicants for admission of the Connecticut home-care program for the elderly established under this section and to distribute such forms as the commissioner prescribes for the program. Such forms shall be supplied by and be returnable to the department.",
              "(g) The commissioner shall report annually, by June first, in accordance with the provisions of section 11-4a , to the joint standing committee of the General Assembly having cognizance of matters relating to human services on the Connecticut home-care program for the elderly in such detail, depth and scope as said committee requires to evaluate the effect of the program on the state and program participants.

              "(h) An individual who is otherwise eligible for services pursuant to this section shall, as a condition of participation in the program, apply for medical assistance benefits when requested to do so by the department and shall accept such benefits if determined eligible.",
              "(i) (1) The Commissioner of Social Services shall, within available appropriations, administer a state-funded portion of the Connecticut home-care program for the elderly for persons (A) who are sixty-five years of age and older and are not eligible for Medicaid; (B) who are inappropriately institutionalized or at risk of inappropriate institutionalization; (C) whose income is less than or equal to the amount allowed for a person who would be eligible for medical assistance if residing in a nursing facility; and (D) whose assets, if single, do not exceed one hundred fifty per cent of the federal minimum community spouse protected amount pursuant to 42 USC 1396r-5(f)(2) or, if married, the couple's assets do not exceed two hundred per cent of said community spouse protected amount. For program applications received by the Department of Social Services for the fiscal years ending June 30, 2016, and June 30, 2017, only persons who require the level of care provided in a nursing home shall be eligible for the state-funded portion of the program, except for persons residing in affordable housing under the assisted living demonstration project established pursuant to section 17b-347e who are otherwise eligible in accordance with this section.",

              "(4) The annualized cost of services provided to an individual under the state-funded portion of the program shall not exceed fifty per cent of the weighted average cost of care in nursing homes in the state, except an individual who received services costing in excess of such amount under the Department of Social Services in the fiscal year ending June 30, 1992, may continue to receive such services, provided the annualized cost of such services does not exceed eighty per cent of the weighted average cost of such nursing home care. The commissioner may allow the cost of services provided to an individual to exceed the maximum cost established pursuant to this subdivision in a case of extreme hardship, as determined by the commissioner, provided in no case shall such cost exceed that of the weighted cost of such nursing home care.",
              "(j) The Commissioner of Social Services shall collect data on services provided under the program, including, but not limited to, the: (1) Number of participants before and after any adjustment in copayments, (2) average hours of care provided under the program per participant, and (3) estimated cost savings to the state by providing home care to participants who may otherwise receive care in a nursing home facility.

            "text": "(a) The Commissioner of Social Services shall administer the Connecticut home-care program for the elderly state-wide in order to prevent the institutionalization of elderly persons who (1) are recipients of medical assistance, (2) are eligible for such assistance, (3) would be eligible for medical assistance if residing in a nursing facility, or (4) meet the criteria for the state-funded portion of the program under subsection (j) of this section. For purposes of this section, “long-term care facility” means a facility that has been federally certified as a skilled nursing facility or intermediate care facility. The commissioner shall make any revisions in the state Medicaid plan required by Title XIX of the Social Security Act prior to implementing the program. The program shall be structured so that the net cost to the state for long-term facility care in combination with the services under the program shall not exceed the net cost the state would have incurred without the program. The commissioner shall investigate the possibility of receiving federal funds for the program and shall apply for any necessary federal waivers. A recipient of services under the program, and the estate and legally liable relatives of the recipient, shall be responsible for reimbursement to the state for such services to the same extent required of a recipient of assistance under the state supplement program, medical assistance program, temporary family assistance program or supplemental nutrition assistance program. Only a United States citizen or a noncitizen who meets the citizenship requirements for eligibility under the Medicaid program shall be eligible for home-care services under this section, except a qualified alien, as defined in Section 431 of Public Law 104-193, admitted into the United States on or after August 22, 1996, or other lawfully residing immigrant alien determined eligible for services under this section prior to July 1, 1997, shall remain eligible for such services. Qualified aliens or other lawfully residing immigrant aliens not determined eligible prior to July 1, 1997, shall be eligible for services under this section subsequent to six months from establishing residency. Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection, any qualified alien or other lawfully residing immigrant alien or alien who formerly held the status of permanently residing under color of law who is a victim of domestic violence or who has intellectual disability shall be eligible for assistance pursuant to this section. Qualified aliens, as defined in Section 431 of Public Law 104-193, or other lawfully residing immigrant aliens or aliens who formerly held the status of permanently residing under color of law shall be eligible for services under this section provided other conditions of eligibility are met.\n\n(b) The commissioner shall solicit bids through a competitive process and shall contract with an access agency, approved by the Office of Policy and Management and the Department of Social Services as meeting the requirements for such agency as defined by regulations adopted pursuant to subsection (m) of this section, that submits proposals that meet or exceed the minimum bid requirements. In addition to such contracts, the commissioner may use department staff to provide screening, coordination, assessment and monitoring functions for the program.\n\n(c) The community-based services covered under the program shall include, but not be limited to, services not otherwise available under the state Medicaid plan: (1) Occupational therapy, (2) homemaker services, (3) companion services, (4) meals on wheels, (5) adult day care, (6) transportation, (7) mental health counseling, (8) care management, (9) elderly foster care, (10) minor home modifications, and (11) assisted living services provided in state-funded congregate housing and in other assisted living pilot or demonstration projects established under state law. Personal care assistance services shall be covered under the program to the extent that (A) such services are not available under the Medicaid state plan and are more cost effective on an individual client basis than existing services covered under such plan, and (B) the provision of such services is approved by the federal government. Recipients of state-funded services, pursuant to subsection (i) of this section, and persons who are determined to be functionally eligible for community-based services who have an application for medical assistance pending, or are determined to be presumptively eligible for Medicaid pursuant to subsection (e) of this section, shall have the cost of home health and community-based services covered by the program, provided they comply with all medical assistance application requirements. Access agencies shall not use department funds to purchase community-based services or home health services from themselves or any related parties.\n\n(d) Physicians, hospitals, long-term care facilities and other licensed health care facilities may disclose, and, as a condition of eligibility for the program, elderly persons, their guardians, and relatives shall disclose, upon request from the Department of Social Services, such financial, social and medical information as may be necessary to enable the department or any agency administering the program on behalf of the department to provide services under the program. Long-term care facilities shall supply the Department of Social Services with the names and addresses of all applicants for admission. Any information provided pursuant to this subsection shall be confidential and shall not be disclosed by the department or administering agency.\n\n(e) (1) The Commissioner of Social Services shall, subject to the provisions of subdivisions (2) and (3) of this subsection, establish a presumptive Medicaid eligibility system under which the state shall fund services under the Connecticut home-care program for the elderly for a period of not longer than ninety days for applicants who require a skilled level of nursing care and who are determined to be presumptively eligible for Medicaid coverage. The system shall include, but need not be limited to: (A) The development of a preliminary screening tool by the Department of Social Services to be used by representatives of the access agency selected pursuant to subsection (b) of this section to determine whether an applicant is functionally able to live at home or in a community setting and is likely to be financially eligible for Medicaid; (B) a requirement that the applicant complete a Medicaid application on the date such applicant is preliminarily screened for functional eligibility or not later than ten days after such screening; (C) a determination of presumptive eligibility for eligible applicants by the department and approval of a care plan authorizing home care services not later than ten days after an applicant is successfully screened for eligibility; and (D) a written agreement to be signed by the applicant (i) attesting to the accuracy of financial and other information such applicant provides, (ii) acknowledging that the state shall solely fund services not longer than ninety days after the date on which home care services begin, and (iii) waiving any right to receive continued coverage while awaiting a hearing that is requested in response to the department's determination during or at the end of the presumptive period of eligibility that (I) the applicant is not eligible for Medicaid or (II) the applicant failed to provide information necessary to allow the department to make an eligibility determination. The department shall make a final determination as to Medicaid eligibility for applicants determined to be presumptively eligible for Medicaid coverage not later than the end of the ninety-day period of presumptive eligibility. The department may make such determination prior to the end of such ninety-day period if it receives information indicating that the applicant is not eligible for Medicaid.\n\n(2) To the extent permitted by federal law, the commissioner shall seek any federal waiver or amend the Medicaid state plan as necessary to attempt to secure federal reimbursement for the costs of providing coverage to persons determined to be presumptively eligible for Medicaid coverage. The provisions of this subsection and any other provision of this section relating to the establishment of a presumptive Medicaid eligibility system, including, but not limited to, such provisions located in subsections (c), (g) and (m), shall not be effective until the commissioner secures such federal reimbursement through a federal waiver or Medicaid state plan amendment.\n\n(3) Not less than two years after the date of the establishment of a presumptive Medicaid eligibility system pursuant to the provisions of this subsection, the commissioner may, in the commissioner's discretion, discontinue the system if the commissioner determines that the system is not cost effective.\n\n(f) The commissioner may require long-term care facilities to inform applicants for admission of the Connecticut home-care program for the elderly established under this section and to distribute such forms as the commissioner prescribes for the program. Such forms shall be supplied by and be returnable to the department.\n\n(g) The commissioner shall report annually, by June first, in accordance with the provisions of section 11-4a , to the joint standing committee of the General Assembly having cognizance of matters relating to human services on the Connecticut home-care program for the elderly in such detail, depth and scope as said committee requires to evaluate the effect of the program on the state and program participants. Such report shall include information on (1) the number of persons diverted from placement in a long-term care facility as a result of the program, (2) the number of persons screened for the program, (3) the number of persons determined presumptively eligible for Medicaid, (4) savings for the state based on institutional care costs that were averted for persons determined to be presumptively eligible for Medicaid who later were determined to be eligible for Medicaid, (5) the number of persons determined presumptively eligible for Medicaid who later were determined not to be eligible for Medicaid and costs to the state to provide such persons with home care services before the final Medicaid eligibility determination, (6) the average cost per person in the program, (7) the administration costs, (8) the estimated savings to provide home care versus institutional care for all persons in the program, and (9) a comparison between costs under the different contracts for program services.\n\n(h) An individual who is otherwise eligible for services pursuant to this section shall, as a condition of participation in the program, apply for medical assistance benefits when requested to do so by the department and shall accept such benefits if determined eligible.\n\n(i) (1) The Commissioner of Social Services shall, within available appropriations, administer a state-funded portion of the Connecticut home-care program for the elderly for persons (A) who are sixty-five years of age and older and are not eligible for Medicaid; (B) who are inappropriately institutionalized or at risk of inappropriate institutionalization; (C) whose income is less than or equal to the amount allowed for a person who would be eligible for medical assistance if residing in a nursing facility; and (D) whose assets, if single, do not exceed one hundred fifty per cent of the federal minimum community spouse protected amount pursuant to 42 USC 1396r-5(f)(2) or, if married, the couple's assets do not exceed two hundred per cent of said community spouse protected amount. For program applications received by the Department of Social Services for the fiscal years ending June 30, 2016, and June 30, 2017, only persons who require the level of care provided in a nursing home shall be eligible for the state-funded portion of the program, except for persons residing in affordable housing under the assisted living demonstration project established pursuant to section 17b-347e who are otherwise eligible in accordance with this section.\n\n(2) Except for persons residing in affordable housing under the assisted living demonstration project established pursuant to section 17b-347e , as provided in subdivision (3) of this subsection, any person whose income is at or below two hundred per cent of the federal poverty level and who is ineligible for Medicaid shall contribute three per cent of the cost of his or her care. Any person whose income exceeds two hundred per cent of the federal poverty level shall contribute three per cent of the cost of his or her care in addition to the amount of applied income determined in accordance with the methodology established by the Department of Social Services for recipients of medical assistance. Any person who does not contribute to the cost of care in accordance with this subdivision shall be ineligible to receive services under this subsection. Notwithstanding any provision of sections 17b-60 and 17b-61 , the department shall not be required to provide an administrative hearing to a person found ineligible for services under this subsection because of a failure to contribute to the cost of care.\n\n(3) Any person who resides in affordable housing under the assisted living demonstration project established pursuant to section 17b-347e and whose income is at or below two hundred per cent of the federal poverty level, shall not be required to contribute to the cost of care. Any person who resides in affordable housing under the assisted living demonstration project established pursuant to section 17b-347e and whose income exceeds two hundred per cent of the federal poverty level, shall contribute to the applied income amount determined in accordance with the methodology established by the Department of Social Services for recipients of medical assistance. Any person whose income exceeds two hundred per cent of the federal poverty level and who does not contribute to the cost of care in accordance with this subdivision shall be ineligible to receive services under this subsection. Notwithstanding any provision of sections 17b-60 and 17b-61 , the department shall not be required to provide an administrative hearing to a person found ineligible for services under this subsection because of a failure to contribute to the cost of care.\n\n(4) The annualized cost of services provided to an individual under the state-funded portion of the program shall not exceed fifty per cent of the weighted average cost of care in nursing homes in the state, except an individual who received services costing in excess of such amount under the Department of Social Services in the fiscal year ending June 30, 1992, may continue to receive such services, provided the annualized cost of such services does not exceed eighty per cent of the weighted average cost of such nursing home care. The commissioner may allow the cost of services provided to an individual to exceed the maximum cost established pursuant to this subdivision in a case of extreme hardship, as determined by the commissioner, provided in no case shall such cost exceed that of the weighted cost of such nursing home care.\n\n(j) The Commissioner of Social Services shall collect data on services provided under the program, including, but not limited to, the: (1) Number of participants before and after any adjustment in copayments, (2) average hours of care provided under the program per participant, and (3) estimated cost savings to the state by providing home care to participants who may otherwise receive care in a nursing home facility. The commissioner shall, in accordance with the provisions of section 11-4a , report on the results of the data collection to the joint standing committees of the General Assembly having cognizance of matters relating to aging, appropriations and the budgets of state agencies and human services not later than July 1, 2022. The commissioner may implement revised criteria for the operation of the program while in the process of adopting such criteria in regulation form, provided the commissioner publishes notice of intention to adopt the regulations in accordance with section 17b-10 . Such criteria shall be valid until the time final regulations are effective.\n\n(k) The commissioner shall notify any access agency or area agency on aging that administers the program when the department sends a redetermination of eligibility form to an individual who is a client of such agency.\n\n(l) In determining eligibility for the program described in this section, the commissioner shall not consider as income (1) Aid and Attendance pension benefits granted to a veteran, as defined in section 27-103 , or the surviving spouse of such veteran, and (2) any tax refund or advance payment with respect to a refundable credit to the same extent such refund or advance payment would be disregarded under 26 USC 6409 in any federal program or state or local program financed in whole or in part with federal funds.\n\n(m) The commissioner shall adopt regulations, in accordance with the provisions of chapter 54, to (1) define “access agency”, (2) implement and administer the program, (3) implement and administer the presumptive Medicaid eligibility system described in subsection (e) of this section, (4) establish uniform state-wide standards for the program and uniform assessment tools for use in the screening process for the program and the prescreening for presumptive Medicaid eligibility, and (5) specify conditions of eligibility."

The Department of Social Services may develop an alternative payment methodology to replace the encounter-based reimbursement system. Such methodology shall be approved by the joint standing committees of the General Assembly having cognizance of matters relating to human services and appropriations and the budgets of state agencies. Until such methodology is implemented, the Department of Social Services shall distribute supplemental funding, within available appropriations, to federally qualified health centers based on cost, volume and quality measures as determined by the Commissioner of Social Services. (1) Beginning with the one-year rate period commencing on October 1, 2012, and annually thereafter, the Commissioner of Social Services may add to a community health center's rates, if applicable, a capital cost rate adjustment that is equivalent to the center's actual or projected year-to-year increase in total allowable depreciation and interest expenses associated with major capital projects divided by the projected service visit volume. For the purposes of this subsection, “capital costs” means expenditures for land or building purchases, fixed assets, movable equipment, capitalized financing fees and capitalized construction period interest and “major capital projects” means projects with costs exceeding two million dollars.

The Department of Social Services may develop an alternative payment methodology to replace the encounter-based reimbursement system. Such methodology shall be approved by the joint standing committees of the General Assembly having cognizance of matters relating to human services and appropriations and the budgets of state agencies. Until such methodology is implemented, the Department of Social Services shall distribute supplemental funding, within available appropriations, to federally qualified health centers based on cost, volume and quality measures as determined by the Commissioner of Social Services. (1) Beginning with the one-year rate period commencing on October 1, 2012, and annually thereafter, the Commissioner of Social Services may add to a community health center's rates, if applicable, a capital cost rate adjustment that is equivalent to the center's actual or projected year-to-year increase in total allowable depreciation and interest expenses associated with major capital projects divided by the projected service visit volume. For the purposes of this subsection, “capital costs” means expenditures for land or building purchases, fixed assets, movable equipment, capitalized financing fees and capitalized construction period interest and “major capital projects” means projects with costs exceeding two million dollars. The commissioner may revise such capital cost rate adjustment retroactively based on actual allowable depreciation and interest expenses or actual service visit volume for the rate period.

For the purpose of this subsection, beds associated with a continuing care facility are not subject to the certificate of need provisions pursuant to sections 17b-352 and 17b-353 ; (3) Medicaid certified beds to be relocated from one licensed nursing facility to another licensed nursing facility to meet a priority need identified in the strategic plan developed pursuant to subsection (c) of section 17b-369 ; (4) licensed Medicaid nursing facility beds to be relocated from one or more existing nursing facilities to a new nursing facility, including a replacement facility, provided (A) no new Medicaid certified beds are added, (B) at least one currently licensed facility is closed in the transaction as a result of the relocation, (C) the relocation is done within available appropriations, (D) the facility participates in the Money Follows the Person demonstration project pursuant to section 17b-369 , (E) the availability of beds in the area of need will not be adversely affected, (F) the certificate of need approval for such new facility or facility relocation and the associated capital expenditures are obtained pursuant to sections 17b-352 and 17b-353 , and (G) the facilities included in the bed relocation and closure shall be in accordance with the strategic plan developed pursuant to subsection (c) of section 17b-369 ; and (5) proposals to build a nontraditional, small-house style nursing home designed to enhance the quality of life for nursing facility residents, provided that the nursing facility agrees to reduce its total number of licensed beds by a percentage determined by the Commissioner of Social Services in accordance with the department's strategic plan for long-term care.\n\n(b) For the purposes of this section and sections 17b-352 and 17b-353 , construction shall be deemed to have begun if the following have occurred and the department has been so notified in writing within the thirty days prior to the date by which construction is to begin: (1) All necessary town, state and federal approvals required to begin construction have been obtained, including all zoning and wetlands approvals; (2) all necessary town and state permits required to begin construction or site work have been obtained; (3) financing approval, as defined in subsection (c) of this section, has been obtained; and (4) construction of a structure approved in the certificate of need has begun. For the purposes of this subsection, commencement of construction of a structure shall include, at a minimum, completion of a foundation. Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection, upon receipt of an application filed at least thirty days prior to the date by which construction is to begin, the commissioner may deem construction to have begun if: (A) An owner of a certificate of need has fully complied with the provisions of subdivisions (1), (2) and (3) of this subsection; (B) such owner submits clear and convincing evidence that he has complied with the provisions of this subsection sufficiently to demonstrate a high probability that construction shall be completed in time to obtain licensure by the Department of Public Health on or before the date required pursuant to subsection (a) of this section; (C) construction of a structure cannot begin due to unforeseeable circumstances beyond the control of the owner; and (D) at least ten per cent of the approved total capital expenditure or two hundred fifty thousand dollars, whichever is greater, has been expended.\n\n(c) For the purposes of subsection (b) of this section, subject to the provisions of subsection (d) of this section, financing shall be deemed to have been obtained if the owner of the certificate of need receives a commitment letter from a lender indicating an affirmative interest in financing the project subject to reasonable and customary conditions, including a final commitment from the lender's loan committee or other entity responsible for approving loans. If a lender which has issued a commitment letter subsequently refuses to finance the project, the owner shall notify the department in writing within five business days of the receipt of the refusal. The owner shall, if so requested by the department, provide the commissioner with copies of all communications between the owner and the lender concerning the request for financing. The owner shall have one further opportunity to obtain financing which shall be demonstrated by submitting another commitment letter from a lender to the department within thirty days of the owner's receipt of the refusal from the first lender.\n\n(d) Financing shall be deemed to have been obtained for the purposes of this section and sections 17b-352 and 17b-353 if the owner of the certificate of need has (1) received a final commitment for financing in writing from a lender or (2) provided evidence to the department that the owner has sufficient funds available to construct the project without financing.\n\n(e) (1) A continuing care facility, as described in section 17b-520 , (A) shall arrange for a medical assessment to be conducted by an independent physician or an access agency approved by the Office of Policy and Management and the Department of Social Services as meeting the requirements for such agency as defined by regulations adopted pursuant to subsection (m) of section 17b-342 , prior to the admission of any resident to the nursing facility and shall document such assessment in the resident's medical file and (B) may transfer or discharge a resident who has intentionally transferred assets in a sum which will render the resident unable to pay the cost of nursing facility care in accordance with the contract between the resident and the facility.\n\n(2) A continuing care facility, as described in section 17b-520 , may, for the seven-year period immediately subsequent to becoming operational, accept nonresidents directly as nursing facility patients on a contractual basis provided any such contract shall include, but not be limited to, requiring the facility (A) to document that placement of the patient in such facility is medically appropriate; (B) to apply to a potential nonresident patient the financial eligibility criteria applied to a potential resident of the facility; and (C) to at least annually screen each nonresident patient to ensure the maintenance of assets, income and insurance sufficient to cover the cost of at least forty-two months of nursing facility care. A facility may transfer or discharge a nonresident patient upon the patient exhausting assets sufficient to pay the costs of his care or upon the facility determining the patient has intentionally transferred assets in a sum which will render the patient unable to pay the costs of a total of forty-two months of nursing facility care from the date of initial admission to the nursing facility. Any such transfer or discharge shall be conducted in accordance with section 19a-535 . The commissioner may grant one or more three-year extensions of the period during which a facility may accept nonresident patients, provided the facility is in compliance with the provisions of this section.\n\n(f) The Commissioner of Social Services may adopt regulations, in accordance with chapter 54, to implement the provisions of this section."

The summary order which the Department of Social Services may issue shall include termination of the facility's participation in Medicaid or appointment of a temporary manager to oversee the operation of the facility and may include transfer of patients to other participating facilities; denial of payment under Medicaid for new admissions; imposition of a directed plan of correction of the facility's deficiencies; imposition of civil monetary penalties; or imposition of other remedies authorized by regulations adopted by the Department of Social Services in accordance with chapter 54.\n\n(c) If the Department of Public Health finds, through the results of a survey, that a nursing facility is not in compliance with one or more of the requirements of Subsections (b), (c) and (d) of 42 USC 1396r, or the requirements of applicable state statutes or regulations, but that such noncompliance does not pose an immediate and obvious threat to patient health or safety, the Department of Public Health shall issue a statement of charges to the facility and shall file a copy of the charges with the Department of Social Services with a request for an order imposing one or more alternative remedies under this subsection. If the Department of Social Services finds, based on a statement of charges filed by the Department of Public Health, that a nursing facility is not in compliance with one or more of the requirements of Subsections (b), (c) and (d) of 42 USC 1396r, or the requirements of applicable state statutes or regulations, but does not issue a summary order, it may impose one or more of the following alternative remedies: Termination of the facility's participation in Medicaid; appointment of a temporary manager to oversee the operation of the facility; transfer of patients to other participating facilities; denial of payment under Medicaid for new admissions; imposition of a directed plan of correction of the facility's deficiencies; imposition of civil monetary penalties; or imposition of other remedies authorized by regulations adopted by the Department of Social Services in accordance with chapter 54. The civil monetary penalties imposed may be in the range of three thousand two hundred fifty dollars to ten thousand dollars per day for each day the facility is found to be out of compliance with one or more requirements of Subsections (b), (c) and (d) of 42 USC 1396r if the failure to comply with such requirements is found to constitute an immediate and serious threat to resident health or safety, or in the range of two hundred dollars to three thousand dollars per day for each day the facility is found to be out of compliance with a requirement of Subsections (b), (c) and (d) of 42 USC 1396r that is found not to constitute an immediate and serious threat to resident health or safety. The exact civil monetary penalty will be set depending on such factors as the existence of repeat deficiencies or uncorrected deficiencies and the overall compliance history of the provider. The remedies available to the Department of Social Services for violations of the requirements of Subsections (b), (c) and (d) of 42 USC 1396r are cumulative and are in addition to the remedies available to the Department of Public Health under chapter 368v for violations of state licensure requirements. Any penalties collected by the Department of Social Services pursuant to this section shall be deposited in a special fund under the control of the Department of Social Services, which fund shall be utilized, in the discretion of the department, for the protection of the health or property of residents of nursing facilities found to be deficient, including payment for the costs of relocating residents, payment for the maintenance of operation of a facility pending correction of deficiencies or closure, and reimbursement of residents for personal funds lost. The deficient nursing facility shall be obligated to reimburse the Department of Social Services for any moneys expended by the department at the facility from the fund established pursuant to this section.\n\n(d) The facility may request a hearing in accordance with the provisions of chapter 54 from the Department of Social Services within ten days of the issuance of the statement of charges or the summary order, as the case may be. If the facility does not request a hearing within ten days and no summary order has been issued, the Department of Social Services shall automatically adopt the Department of Public Health's findings and shall issue an order incorporating one or more of the remedies authorized by subsection (c) of this section. If the facility timely requests a hearing or the Department of Social Services issues a summary order, the Department of Social Services shall issue a notice of hearing. At such hearing the facility shall be given the opportunity to present evidence and cross-examine witnesses. The Department of Social Services shall issue a decision based on the administrative record and may, if it finds the facility not in compliance with one or more of the requirements of Subsections (b), (c) and (d) of 42 USC 1396r, or the requirements of applicable state statutes or regulations, order any of the remedies specified in this section. The Department of Social Services may impose any of the alternative remedies, except for a civil monetary penalty, during the pendency of any proceedings conducted pursuant to this subsection. In such cases, the Department of Social Services must provide the facility the opportunity to discuss the Department of Public Health's findings at an informal conference prior to the imposition of any remedy. The requirement of an informal conference does not apply to summary order proceedings."

If the temporary manager determines that the condition of the facility requires that arrangements be made for the transfer of residents in order to assure their health and safety, the temporary manager shall direct the facility's efforts in locating alternative placements and in preparing discharge plans which meet the requirements of section 19a-535 and shall supervise the transportation of residents and such residents' belongings and medical records to the places where such residents are being transferred or discharged. A temporary manager shall not be liable for injury to person or property that is attributable to the conditions of such facility and shall only be liable for his acts or omissions that constitute gross, wilful or wanton negligence. The Department of Social Services, upon application by the temporary manager or the administrator of such facility, may terminate the temporary manager if it finds that the condition of the facility no longer warrants the appointment of a temporary manager. If the department denies an application for the termination of a temporary manager brought pursuant to this section, the facility or the temporary manager may obtain review of such determination by a hearing conducted pursuant to chapter 54, provided that the hearing is requested within fifteen days of the provision of notice denying the application. Any temporary manager appointed by the Department of Social Services pursuant to section 17b-357 shall be paid a reasonable fee for his services to be determined and to be paid by the department. The facility shall be liable to the department for the cost of services of the temporary manager appointed at such facility and the department may recover the cost thereof by setting off such amount against the funds that would otherwise be paid to such facility for services rendered to recipients of assistance under the Medicaid program.

In the event of decertification of a nursing facility and the consequent termination or nonrenewal of a Medicaid provider agreement with a facility, the Department of Social Services may continue Medicaid payments on behalf of recipients of medical assistance for a phase-down period of thirty days, provided eligibility for continued Medicaid payments during such thirty-day phase-down period shall be conditioned upon a determination by the Department of Social Services that the facility has engaged in reasonable efforts to transfer assisted patients to alternative facilities during such period. As a further condition of eligibility for continued Medicaid payments during such period, the facility shall cooperate with any temporary manager appointed for such facility by the Department of Social Services.

If the individual requires such level of services, the Department of Developmental Services shall also determine whether the individual requires specialized services for such condition. An individual who is determined by the Department of Developmental Services to have intellectual disability or to have a related condition and is determined not to require nursing facility level of services shall not be admitted to a nursing facility. In order to implement the preadmission review requirements of this section, and to identify applicants for admission who may have intellectual disability or have conditions related to intellectual disability and subject to the requirements of this section, nursing facilities may not admit any individual irrespective of source of payment, unless an identification screen developed, or in the case of out-of-state residents approved, by the Department of Social Services has been completed for the applicant and filed in accordance with federal law.\n\n(c) No payment from any source shall be due to a nursing facility that admits a resident in violation of the preadmission screening requirements of this section.\n\n(d) A nursing facility shall notify the Department of Developmental Services when a resident who has intellectual disability undergoes a change in condition or when a resident who has not previously been diagnosed as having intellectual disability undergoes a significant change in condition that may require specialized services. Upon such notification, the Department of Developmental Services, under the auspices of the Department of Social Services, shall perform an evaluation to determine whether the resident requires the level of services provided by a nursing facility or requires specialized services for intellectual disability.\n\n(e) In the case of a resident who is determined under subsection (d) of this section not to require the level of services provided by a nursing facility but to require specialized services for intellectual disability or a condition related to intellectual disability and who has continually resided in a nursing facility for at least thirty months before the date of the determination, the resident may elect to remain in the facility or to receive services covered by Medicaid in an alternative appropriate institutional or noninstitutional setting in accordance with the terms of the alternative disposition plan submitted by the Department of Social Services and approved by the Secretary of the United States Department of Health and Human Services.\n\n(f) In the case of a resident with intellectual disability or a related condition who is determined under subsection (d) of this section not to require the level of services provided by a nursing facility but to require specialized services for intellectual disability or a related condition and who has not continuously resided in a nursing facility for at least thirty months before the date of the determination, the nursing facility, in consultation with the Department of Developmental Services, shall arrange for the safe and orderly discharge of the resident from the facility. If the department determines that the provision of specialized services requires an alternative residential placement, the discharge and transfer of the patient shall be in accordance with the alternative disposition plan submitted by the Department of Social Services and approved by the Secretary of the United States Department of Health and Human Services, except if an alternative residential facility is not available, the resident shall not be transferred.\n\n(g) In the case of a resident who is determined under subsection (d) of this section not to require the level of services provided by a nursing facility and not to require specialized services, the nursing facility shall arrange for the safe and orderly discharge of the resident from the facility.\n\n(h) The Department of Developmental Services shall be the agency responsible for making the determinations required by this section on behalf of individuals who have intellectual disability and on behalf of individuals with conditions related to intellectual disability and may provide services to such individuals to the extent required by federal law.\n\n(i) Any person seeking admittance to a nursing facility or any resident of a nursing facility who is adversely affected by a determination of the Department of Developmental Services under this section may appeal such determination to the Department of Social Services within fifteen days of the receipt of the notice of a determination by the Department of Developmental Services. If an appeal is taken to the Department of Social Services, the determination of the Department of Developmental Services shall be stayed pending determination by the Department of Social Services."

Such report shall include (A) the status of the implementation of the Money Follows the Person demonstration project, (B) the anticipated date that the first eligible person or persons will be transitioned into the community, and (C) information concerning when and how the Department of Social Services will transition additional eligible persons into the community.\n\n(c) The Commissioner of Social Services shall develop a strategic plan, consistent with the long-term care plan established pursuant to section 17b-337 , to rebalance Medicaid long-term care supports and services, including, but not limited to, those supports and services provided in home, community-based settings and institutional settings. The commissioner shall include home, community-based and institutional providers in the development of the strategic plan. In developing the strategic plan the commissioner shall consider topics that include, but are not limited to: (1) Regional trends concerning the state's aging population; (2) trends in the demand for home, community-based and institutional services; (3) gaps in the provision of home and community-based services which prevent community placements; (4) gaps in the provision of institutional care; (5) the quality of care provided by home, community-based and institutional providers; (6) the condition of institutional buildings; (7) the state's regional supply of institutional beds; (8) the current rate structure applicable to home, community-based and institutional services; (9) the methods of implementing adjustments to the bed capacity of individual nursing facilities; and (10) a review of the provisions of subsection (a) of section 17b-354 .\n\n(d) The Commissioner of Social Services shall, within available resources, maintain a data collection system, in accordance with the federal reporting requirements pursuant to Section 6071 of the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005, as amended from time to time, to guide the development of the strategic plan for long-term care. In maintaining the data collection system, the commissioner shall, as applicable: (1) Establish a process to identify and report on individuals participating in the Money Follows the Person demonstration project who signed an informed consent agreement to participate; (2) ensure that persons and agencies identifying persons as candidates for the Money Follows the Person demonstration project have access to information regarding plans to transition persons from institutional to community living and options for persons not eligible for the demonstration project; (3) ensure that Money Follows the Person demonstration project participants are counted only once for reporting purposes regardless of how many times they have been referred to the demonstration project; (4) establish a benchmark length of time that Money Follows the Person demonstration project participants may hold a status of “transition in process” before they are placed in a home in the community; and (5) identify steps to reduce the post-transition outcome of premature death for participants with chronic diseases or health conditions, including cardiac, pulmonary and endocrinal conditions or diabetes.\n\n(e) The Commissioner of Social Services may contract with nursing facilities, as defined in section 17b-357 , and home and community-based providers for the purpose of carrying out the strategic plan. In addition, the commissioner may revise a rate paid to a nursing facility pursuant to section 17b-340 in order to effectuate the strategic plan. The commissioner may fund strategic plan initiatives with federal grant-in-aid resources available to the state pursuant to the Money Follows the Person demonstration project pursuant to Section 6071 of the Deficit Reduction Act, P.L. 109-171, and the State Balancing Incentive Payments Program under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, P.L. 111-148.\n\n(f) If a nursing facility has reason to know that a resident is likely to become financially eligible for Medicaid benefits within one hundred eighty days, the nursing facility shall notify the resident or the resident's representative and the department. The department may (1) assess any such resident to determine if the resident prefers and is able to live appropriately at home or in some other community-based setting, and (2) develop a care plan and assist the resident in his or her transition to the community.\n\n(g) The Commissioner of Public Health, or the commissioner's designee, may waive the requirements of sections 19-13-D8t, 19-13-D6 and 19-13-D105 of the regulations of Connecticut state agencies, if a provider requires such a waiver for purposes of effectuating the strategic plan developed pursuant to subsection (c) of this section and the commissioner, or the commissioner's designee, determines that such waiver will not endanger the health and safety of the provider's residents or clients. The commissioner, or the commissioner's designee, may impose conditions on the granting of any waiver which are necessary to ensure the health and safety of the provider's residents or clients. The commissioner, or the commissioner's designee, may revoke any waiver granted pursuant to this subsection upon a finding that the health or safety of a resident or client of a provider has been jeopardized."
