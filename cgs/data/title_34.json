A manager may be removed at any time by the consent of a majority in interest of the members without notice or cause.\n\n(6) A person need not be a member to be a manager, but the dissociation of a member that is also a manager removes the person as a manager. If a person that is both a manager and a member ceases to be a manager, that cessation does not by itself dissociate the person as a member.\n\n(7) A person's ceasing to be a manager does not discharge any debt, obligation or other liability to the limited liability company or members which the person incurred while a manager.\n\n(d) An action requiring the vote or consent of members under sections 34-243 to 34-283d , inclusive, may be taken without a meeting, and a member may appoint a proxy or other agent to vote, consent or otherwise act for the member by signing an appointing record, personally or by the member's agent.\n\n(e) The dissolution of a limited liability company does not affect the applicability of this section. However, a person that wrongfully causes dissolution of the company loses the right to participate in management as a member and a manager.\n\n(f) A limited liability company shall reimburse a member for an advance to the company beyond the amount of capital the member agreed to contribute.\n\n(g) A payment or advance made by a member that gives rise to an obligation of the limited liability company under subsection (f) of this section or subsection (a) of section 34-255g constitutes a loan to the company.\n\n(h) A member is not entitled to remuneration for services performed for a member-managed limited liability company, except for reasonable compensation for services rendered in winding up the activities of the company."
