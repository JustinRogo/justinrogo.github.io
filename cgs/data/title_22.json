              "(a) No person may use any noise-making device to scare or repel wildlife in order to prevent the damage and destruction of agricultural crops unless such person obtains a permit for each such device from the Commissioner of Agriculture. Notwithstanding any provision of the general statutes or any provision of a municipal ordinance, which ordinance is adopted after June 21, 1967, a person engaged in agriculture may make written application to the commissioner for such a permit on forms prescribed by the commissioner. The commissioner, or the commissioner's designee, may make an on-site inspection prior to making a final determination regarding an application for such permit. Prior to the issuance of such permit, the applicant shall provide evidence of the need for protection of the applicant's crops, a description of other methods employed to prevent crop damage and an estimate of the potential loss, as a percentage of the crop, attributed to wildlife damage. The term of the permit shall be for the period for which protection of the crops specified in the application is necessary.",
              "(b) The application shall state (1) the type of noise-making device to be used, (2) the location of the farm where such device will be used, (3) the locations on the farm where such device will be used, (4) the animal causing damage, (5) the crops to be protected, (6) the hours and interval of operation, (7) the period for which protection is needed, and (8) the name, address and signature of applicant or landowner, if different.",
              "(c) The commissioner may authorize the use of the following in permits issued under this section: Propane exploders, acetylene exploders, carbide exploders, electronic noisemakers and similar noise-making devices. The use of fire crackers and similar explosives is prohibited. No permit shall be issued for the use of any noise-making device for a property of less than five acres in area or for use within five hundred feet of any dwelling, other than the dwelling of the applicant for such permit, without the written consent of the occupants of such dwelling.",
              "(d) No person may operate or allow the operation of noise-making devices pursuant to this section in excess of 80 dB peak sound pressure level from ten o'clock p.m. to seven o'clock a.m. local time or in excess of 100 dB peak sound pressure level from seven o'clock a.m. to ten o'clock p.m. local time. Such sound level shall be as measured from the property line of any receptor residential property. Any noise-making device authorized pursuant to this section shall be operated in accordance with the recommendations of the manufacturer of such device and any written conditions contained in the permit that the commissioner or the commissioner's designee deems appropriate.",
              "(e) No noise-making device shall be used in any manner or in any location that may endanger public safety. Any noise-making device permitted under this section to repel or scare birds may only be operated from one-half hour before sunrise to one-half hour after sunset. Any such noise-making device used to repel or scare nocturnal or crepuscular marauding wild animals may be operated between sunset and sunrise.",
              "(f) Any noise-making device used pursuant to this section shall bear a weather-resistant tag that shall state the name, address and phone number of the operator of the noise-making device.

In making any such decision, the commissioner may consult with experts in wildlife damage to crops and any county or state-wide advisory group the commissioner deems appropriate. For the purposes of this subsection, “undue hardship” means causing significant injury to the health and comfort of a person, as a result of the use of the permitted device while such person is on his or her own real property and within the curtilage of his or her home.",
              "(2) The commissioner may require the implementation of a best practical use procedure by a permittee in response to a resolution adopted pursuant to subdivision (1) of this subsection if the commissioner determines that such a best practical use procedure is feasible to limit the excessive use of such permitted device. Any such best practical use procedure shall limit the use of the permitted device to an extent that provides for the least detrimental level of use of such permitted device while enabling such device to be effective. In developing any such best practical use procedure, the commissioner shall assess the permitted device, the accepted trade practices associated with the effective use of such device, the technical feasibility of implementation and use of a best practical use procedure, the nature of the area in which the permitted device is used, the crop that is intended to be protected through use of such device and the wildlife that is intended to be scared or repelled by use of the permitted device. The provisions of this subsection shall not be construed to authorize any cause of action.",

            "text": "(a) No person may use any noise-making device to scare or repel wildlife in order to prevent the damage and destruction of agricultural crops unless such person obtains a permit for each such device from the Commissioner of Agriculture. Notwithstanding any provision of the general statutes or any provision of a municipal ordinance, which ordinance is adopted after June 21, 1967, a person engaged in agriculture may make written application to the commissioner for such a permit on forms prescribed by the commissioner. The commissioner, or the commissioner's designee, may make an on-site inspection prior to making a final determination regarding an application for such permit. Prior to the issuance of such permit, the applicant shall provide evidence of the need for protection of the applicant's crops, a description of other methods employed to prevent crop damage and an estimate of the potential loss, as a percentage of the crop, attributed to wildlife damage. The term of the permit shall be for the period for which protection of the crops specified in the application is necessary.\n\n(b) The application shall state (1) the type of noise-making device to be used, (2) the location of the farm where such device will be used, (3) the locations on the farm where such device will be used, (4) the animal causing damage, (5) the crops to be protected, (6) the hours and interval of operation, (7) the period for which protection is needed, and (8) the name, address and signature of applicant or landowner, if different.\n\n(c) The commissioner may authorize the use of the following in permits issued under this section: Propane exploders, acetylene exploders, carbide exploders, electronic noisemakers and similar noise-making devices. The use of fire crackers and similar explosives is prohibited. No permit shall be issued for the use of any noise-making device for a property of less than five acres in area or for use within five hundred feet of any dwelling, other than the dwelling of the applicant for such permit, without the written consent of the occupants of such dwelling.\n\n(d) No person may operate or allow the operation of noise-making devices pursuant to this section in excess of 80 dB peak sound pressure level from ten o'clock p.m. to seven o'clock a.m. local time or in excess of 100 dB peak sound pressure level from seven o'clock a.m. to ten o'clock p.m. local time. Such sound level shall be as measured from the property line of any receptor residential property. Any noise-making device authorized pursuant to this section shall be operated in accordance with the recommendations of the manufacturer of such device and any written conditions contained in the permit that the commissioner or the commissioner's designee deems appropriate.\n\n(e) No noise-making device shall be used in any manner or in any location that may endanger public safety. Any noise-making device permitted under this section to repel or scare birds may only be operated from one-half hour before sunrise to one-half hour after sunset. Any such noise-making device used to repel or scare nocturnal or crepuscular marauding wild animals may be operated between sunset and sunrise.\n\n(f) Any noise-making device used pursuant to this section shall bear a weather-resistant tag that shall state the name, address and phone number of the operator of the noise-making device. At all times, such tag shall be securely affixed to the noise-making device and shall be legible.\n\n(g) (1) If the legislative body of any municipality adopts a resolution that states that there is undue hardship on nearby residents as a result of the use of any device permitted under this section, and that requests that the commissioner deny or cancel the right to use such device, or, in the alternative, institute a best practical use procedure described in subdivision (2) of this subsection, the commissioner, in accordance with the provisions of chapter 54, may deny or cancel a permit to use such device, or, in the alternative, institute a best practical use procedure in accordance with subdivision (2) of this subsection, if the commissioner determines that its use creates, or will create, an undue hardship on nearby residents. In making any such decision, the commissioner may consult with experts in wildlife damage to crops and any county or state-wide advisory group the commissioner deems appropriate. For the purposes of this subsection, “undue hardship” means causing significant injury to the health and comfort of a person, as a result of the use of the permitted device while such person is on his or her own real property and within the curtilage of his or her home.\n\n(2) The commissioner may require the implementation of a best practical use procedure by a permittee in response to a resolution adopted pursuant to subdivision (1) of this subsection if the commissioner determines that such a best practical use procedure is feasible to limit the excessive use of such permitted device. Any such best practical use procedure shall limit the use of the permitted device to an extent that provides for the least detrimental level of use of such permitted device while enabling such device to be effective. In developing any such best practical use procedure, the commissioner shall assess the permitted device, the accepted trade practices associated with the effective use of such device, the technical feasibility of implementation and use of a best practical use procedure, the nature of the area in which the permitted device is used, the crop that is intended to be protected through use of such device and the wildlife that is intended to be scared or repelled by use of the permitted device. The provisions of this subsection shall not be construed to authorize any cause of action.\n\n(h) The Commissioner of Agriculture, or the commissioner's designee, shall issue a warning notice for each of the first two violations by a permittee of any provision of this section in any twelve-month period. The commissioner shall revoke a permit issued pursuant to this section for not less than one year upon the third violation of this section in any twelve-month period by such permittee. Any person who has his or her permit revoked by the commissioner or the commissioner's designee may appeal such order provided such person requests a hearing, in writing, to the commissioner and such request is received by the commissioner not later than fifteen days after the date of such order. During any such appeal, such order shall remain in effect until a final decision is rendered. The commissioner may appoint a hearing officer to hear such appeal and render a final decision, as the commissioner deems appropriate. In any such appeal, the only consideration shall be whether the violation or violations alleged actually occurred.\n\n(i) Any person who operates a noise-making device without a permit, during an appeal period for a permit revocation, or after a permit is revoked shall be fined one hundred dollars for the first offense and three hundred dollars for a second and any subsequent offense. Each noise-making device operated in violation of this section shall constitute a separate offense."

              "(a) There is established within the Department of Agriculture a program to solicit, from owners of agricultural land, offers to sell the development rights to such land and to inform the public of the purposes, goals and provisions of this chapter. The commissioner, with the approval of the State Properties Review Board, shall have the power to acquire or accept as a gift, on behalf of the state, the development rights of any agricultural land, if offered by the owner. Notice of the offer shall be filed in the land records wherein the agricultural land is situated. If ownership of any land for which development rights have been offered is transferred, the offer shall be effective until the subsequent owner revokes the offer in writing. The state conservation and development plan established pursuant to section 16a-24 shall be applied as an advisory document to the acquisition of development rights of any agricultural lands. The factors to be considered by the commissioner in deciding whether or not to acquire such rights shall include, but not be limited to, the following: (1) The probability that the land will be sold for nonagricultural purposes; (2) the current productivity of such land and the likelihood of continued productivity; (3) the suitability of the land as to soil classification and other criteria for agricultural use; (4) the degree to which such acquisition would contribute to the preservation of the agricultural potential of the state; (5) any encumbrances on such land; (6) the cost of acquiring such rights; and (7) the degree to which such acquisition would mitigate damage due to flood hazards. Ownership by a nonprofit organization authorized to hold land for conservation and preservation purposes of land which prior to such ownership qualified for the program established pursuant to this section shall not be deemed to diminish the probability that the land will be sold for nonagricultural purposes. After a preliminary evaluation of such factors by the Commissioner of Agriculture, he shall obtain and review one or more fee appraisals of the property selected in order to determine the value of the development rights of such property. The commissioner shall notify the Department of Transportation, the Department of Economic and Community Development, the Department of Energy and Environmental Protection and the Office of Policy and Management that such property is being appraised. Any appraisal of the value of such land obtained by the owner and performed in a manner approved by the commissioner shall be considered by the commissioner in making such determination. The value of development rights for all purposes of this section shall be the difference between the value of the property for its highest and best use and its value for agricultural purposes as determined by the commissioner. The use or presence of pollutants or chemicals in the soil shall not be deemed to diminish the agricultural value of the land or to prohibit the commissioner from acquiring the development rights to such land. The commissioner may purchase development rights for a lesser amount provided he complies with all factors for acquisition specified in this subsection and in any implementing regulations. In determining the value of the property for its highest and best use, consideration shall be given but not limited to sales of comparable properties in the general area, use of which was unrestricted at the time of sale.",
              "(b) Upon the acquisition by the commissioner of the development rights of agricultural land, the commissioner shall cause to be filed in the appropriate land records and in the office of the Secretary of the State a notice of such acquisition which shall set forth a description of the agricultural land as will be sufficient to give any prospective purchaser of such agricultural land or creditor of the owner thereof notice of such restriction. Upon such filing, the owner of such agricultural land shall not be permitted to exercise development rights with respect to such land, and such development rights shall be considered and deemed dedicated to the state in perpetuity, except as hereinafter provided. If restricted land is to be sold, the owner shall notify, in writing, the commissioner of such impending sale not more than ninety days before transfer of title to the land and shall provide the commissioner with the name and address of the new owner.",
              "(c) The commissioner shall have no power to release such land from its agricultural restriction, except as set forth in this subsection. The commissioner, in consultation with such advisory groups as the Commissioner of Agriculture may appoint, may approve (1) a petition by the owner of the restricted agricultural land to remove such restriction provided such petition is approved by resolution of the legislative body of the town, or (2) a petition by the legislative body of the town in which such land is situated to remove such restriction provided such petition is approved in writing by said owner. Upon approval of such a petition by the commissioner, the legislative body of the town shall submit to the qualified voters of such town the question of removing the agricultural restriction from such land or a part thereof, at a referendum held at a regular election or a special election warned and called for that purpose. In the event a majority of those voting at such referendum are in favor of such removal, the restriction shall be removed from the agricultural land upon filing of the certified results of such referendum in the land records and the office of the Secretary of the State, and the commissioner shall convey the development rights to such owner provided such owner shall pay the commissioner an amount equal to the value of such rights. Such petition shall set forth the facts and circumstances upon which the commissioner shall consider approval, and said commissioner shall deny such approval unless he determines that the public interest is such that there is an overriding necessity to relinquish control of the development rights. The commissioner shall hold at least one public hearing prior to the initiation of any proceedings hereunder. The expenses, if any, of the hearing and the referendum shall be borne by the petitioner. In the event that the state sells any development rights under the procedure provided in this subsection, it shall receive the value of such rights.",
              "(d) Whenever the commissioner acquires the development rights of any agricultural land and the purchase price of such development rights is ten thousand dollars or more, said commissioner and the owner of such land may enter into a written agreement which provides for the payment of the purchase price in two or three annual installments, but no interest shall be paid on any unpaid balance of such purchase price.",
              "(e) Whenever the commissioner acquires the development rights to any agricultural land, and any municipality in which all or part of the land is situated paid a part of the purchase price from a fund established pursuant to section 7-131q , such municipality and the state may jointly own the development rights. The land may be released from its agricultural restriction in accordance with the provisions of subsection (c) of this section. The commissioner shall adopt regulations in accordance with the provisions of chapter 54 establishing procedures for the joint acquisition of development rights to agricultural land.",
              "(f) The acquisition of the development rights to any agricultural land by the commissioner shall not be deemed to be ownership of such land and the state shall not be liable for pollution or contamination of such land and no person may bring a civil action against the state for damages resulting from pollution or contamination of such agricultural land.",
              "(g) The commissioner may issue a letter of intent requesting the assistance of a nonprofit organization, as defined in Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, or any subsequent corresponding internal revenue code of the United States, as from time to time amended, in acquiring the development rights to certain agricultural land. If such organization acquires such rights it may sell them to the commissioner based on a purchase agreement. Such agreement may include reimbursement for reasonable expenses incurred in the acquisition of the rights as well as payment for the rights. The commissioner may enter into joint ownership agreements to acquire the development rights to any qualified agricultural land with any nonprofit organization, as defined in Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, or any subsequent corresponding internal revenue code of the United States, as from time to time amended, provided the mission of such nonprofit organization is the permanent protection of agricultural land for the purposes of continued agricultural use.",
              "(h) In addition to development rights, the commissioner may acquire or accept as a gift the rights of the owner to construct any residences or any farm structures on agricultural land.",
              "(i) The Commissioner of Agriculture, pursuant to any cooperative agreement with the United States Department of Agriculture for the disbursement of funds under federal law, may require that any property to which rights are acquired under this section with such funds shall be managed in accordance with a conservation plan which utilizes the standards and specifications of the Natural Resources Conservation Service field office technical guide and is approved by such service. Additionally, such conservation plan shall require the establishment of model pollinator habitat, as described in section 22-90b . Any instrument by which the commissioner acquires such rights and for which any such funds are used may provide for a contingent right in the United States of America in the event that the state of Connecticut fails to enforce any of the terms of its rights acquired under this section which failure shall be determined by the United States Secretary of Agriculture. Such contingent right shall entitle the secretary to enforce any rights acquired by the state under this section by any authority provided under law. Such instrument may provide that such rights shall become vested in the United States of America in the event that the state of Connecticut attempts to terminate, transfer or otherwise divest itself of any such rights without the prior consent of the United States Secretary of Agriculture and payment of consideration to the United States and may further provide that title to such rights may be held by the United States of America at any time at the request of the United States Secretary of Agriculture. In connection with such an agreement, the commissioner may hold the United States harmless from any action based on negligence in the procurement or management of any rights acquired under this section and may assure that proper title evidence is secured, that the title is insured to the amount of the federal cost paid for the interest of the United States of America and that, in the event of a failure of title, as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction, and payment of insurance to the state, the state will reimburse the United States for the amount of the federal cost paid.",
              "(j) The commissioner, when acquiring the development rights of any agricultural lands on behalf of the state, may incorporate deed requirements in accordance with the provisions of the federal Farm and Ranch Lands Protection Program, 7 CFR 1491.1, et seq., or under the Agricultural Conservation Easement Program, 7 CFR 1468.1, et seq., or any successive federal farmland protection program.",

            "text": "(a) There is established within the Department of Agriculture a program to solicit, from owners of agricultural land, offers to sell the development rights to such land and to inform the public of the purposes, goals and provisions of this chapter. The commissioner, with the approval of the State Properties Review Board, shall have the power to acquire or accept as a gift, on behalf of the state, the development rights of any agricultural land, if offered by the owner. Notice of the offer shall be filed in the land records wherein the agricultural land is situated. If ownership of any land for which development rights have been offered is transferred, the offer shall be effective until the subsequent owner revokes the offer in writing. The state conservation and development plan established pursuant to section 16a-24 shall be applied as an advisory document to the acquisition of development rights of any agricultural lands. The factors to be considered by the commissioner in deciding whether or not to acquire such rights shall include, but not be limited to, the following: (1) The probability that the land will be sold for nonagricultural purposes; (2) the current productivity of such land and the likelihood of continued productivity; (3) the suitability of the land as to soil classification and other criteria for agricultural use; (4) the degree to which such acquisition would contribute to the preservation of the agricultural potential of the state; (5) any encumbrances on such land; (6) the cost of acquiring such rights; and (7) the degree to which such acquisition would mitigate damage due to flood hazards. Ownership by a nonprofit organization authorized to hold land for conservation and preservation purposes of land which prior to such ownership qualified for the program established pursuant to this section shall not be deemed to diminish the probability that the land will be sold for nonagricultural purposes. After a preliminary evaluation of such factors by the Commissioner of Agriculture, he shall obtain and review one or more fee appraisals of the property selected in order to determine the value of the development rights of such property. The commissioner shall notify the Department of Transportation, the Department of Economic and Community Development, the Department of Energy and Environmental Protection and the Office of Policy and Management that such property is being appraised. Any appraisal of the value of such land obtained by the owner and performed in a manner approved by the commissioner shall be considered by the commissioner in making such determination. The value of development rights for all purposes of this section shall be the difference between the value of the property for its highest and best use and its value for agricultural purposes as determined by the commissioner. The use or presence of pollutants or chemicals in the soil shall not be deemed to diminish the agricultural value of the land or to prohibit the commissioner from acquiring the development rights to such land. The commissioner may purchase development rights for a lesser amount provided he complies with all factors for acquisition specified in this subsection and in any implementing regulations. In determining the value of the property for its highest and best use, consideration shall be given but not limited to sales of comparable properties in the general area, use of which was unrestricted at the time of sale.\n\n(b) Upon the acquisition by the commissioner of the development rights of agricultural land, the commissioner shall cause to be filed in the appropriate land records and in the office of the Secretary of the State a notice of such acquisition which shall set forth a description of the agricultural land as will be sufficient to give any prospective purchaser of such agricultural land or creditor of the owner thereof notice of such restriction. Upon such filing, the owner of such agricultural land shall not be permitted to exercise development rights with respect to such land, and such development rights shall be considered and deemed dedicated to the state in perpetuity, except as hereinafter provided. If restricted land is to be sold, the owner shall notify, in writing, the commissioner of such impending sale not more than ninety days before transfer of title to the land and shall provide the commissioner with the name and address of the new owner.\n\n(c) The commissioner shall have no power to release such land from its agricultural restriction, except as set forth in this subsection. The commissioner, in consultation with such advisory groups as the Commissioner of Agriculture may appoint, may approve (1) a petition by the owner of the restricted agricultural land to remove such restriction provided such petition is approved by resolution of the legislative body of the town, or (2) a petition by the legislative body of the town in which such land is situated to remove such restriction provided such petition is approved in writing by said owner. Upon approval of such a petition by the commissioner, the legislative body of the town shall submit to the qualified voters of such town the question of removing the agricultural restriction from such land or a part thereof, at a referendum held at a regular election or a special election warned and called for that purpose. In the event a majority of those voting at such referendum are in favor of such removal, the restriction shall be removed from the agricultural land upon filing of the certified results of such referendum in the land records and the office of the Secretary of the State, and the commissioner shall convey the development rights to such owner provided such owner shall pay the commissioner an amount equal to the value of such rights. Such petition shall set forth the facts and circumstances upon which the commissioner shall consider approval, and said commissioner shall deny such approval unless he determines that the public interest is such that there is an overriding necessity to relinquish control of the development rights. The commissioner shall hold at least one public hearing prior to the initiation of any proceedings hereunder. The expenses, if any, of the hearing and the referendum shall be borne by the petitioner. In the event that the state sells any development rights under the procedure provided in this subsection, it shall receive the value of such rights.\n\n(d) Whenever the commissioner acquires the development rights of any agricultural land and the purchase price of such development rights is ten thousand dollars or more, said commissioner and the owner of such land may enter into a written agreement which provides for the payment of the purchase price in two or three annual installments, but no interest shall be paid on any unpaid balance of such purchase price.\n\n(e) Whenever the commissioner acquires the development rights to any agricultural land, and any municipality in which all or part of the land is situated paid a part of the purchase price from a fund established pursuant to section 7-131q , such municipality and the state may jointly own the development rights. The land may be released from its agricultural restriction in accordance with the provisions of subsection (c) of this section. The commissioner shall adopt regulations in accordance with the provisions of chapter 54 establishing procedures for the joint acquisition of development rights to agricultural land.\n\n(f) The acquisition of the development rights to any agricultural land by the commissioner shall not be deemed to be ownership of such land and the state shall not be liable for pollution or contamination of such land and no person may bring a civil action against the state for damages resulting from pollution or contamination of such agricultural land.\n\n(g) The commissioner may issue a letter of intent requesting the assistance of a nonprofit organization, as defined in Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, or any subsequent corresponding internal revenue code of the United States, as from time to time amended, in acquiring the development rights to certain agricultural land. If such organization acquires such rights it may sell them to the commissioner based on a purchase agreement. Such agreement may include reimbursement for reasonable expenses incurred in the acquisition of the rights as well as payment for the rights. The commissioner may enter into joint ownership agreements to acquire the development rights to any qualified agricultural land with any nonprofit organization, as defined in Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, or any subsequent corresponding internal revenue code of the United States, as from time to time amended, provided the mission of such nonprofit organization is the permanent protection of agricultural land for the purposes of continued agricultural use.\n\n(h) In addition to development rights, the commissioner may acquire or accept as a gift the rights of the owner to construct any residences or any farm structures on agricultural land.\n\n(i) The Commissioner of Agriculture, pursuant to any cooperative agreement with the United States Department of Agriculture for the disbursement of funds under federal law, may require that any property to which rights are acquired under this section with such funds shall be managed in accordance with a conservation plan which utilizes the standards and specifications of the Natural Resources Conservation Service field office technical guide and is approved by such service. Additionally, such conservation plan shall require the establishment of model pollinator habitat, as described in section 22-90b . Any instrument by which the commissioner acquires such rights and for which any such funds are used may provide for a contingent right in the United States of America in the event that the state of Connecticut fails to enforce any of the terms of its rights acquired under this section which failure shall be determined by the United States Secretary of Agriculture. Such contingent right shall entitle the secretary to enforce any rights acquired by the state under this section by any authority provided under law. Such instrument may provide that such rights shall become vested in the United States of America in the event that the state of Connecticut attempts to terminate, transfer or otherwise divest itself of any such rights without the prior consent of the United States Secretary of Agriculture and payment of consideration to the United States and may further provide that title to such rights may be held by the United States of America at any time at the request of the United States Secretary of Agriculture. In connection with such an agreement, the commissioner may hold the United States harmless from any action based on negligence in the procurement or management of any rights acquired under this section and may assure that proper title evidence is secured, that the title is insured to the amount of the federal cost paid for the interest of the United States of America and that, in the event of a failure of title, as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction, and payment of insurance to the state, the state will reimburse the United States for the amount of the federal cost paid.\n\n(j) The commissioner, when acquiring the development rights of any agricultural lands on behalf of the state, may incorporate deed requirements in accordance with the provisions of the federal Farm and Ranch Lands Protection Program, 7 CFR 1491.1, et seq., or under the Agricultural Conservation Easement Program, 7 CFR 1468.1, et seq., or any successive federal farmland protection program.\n\nSee Sec. 4b-3(f) re approval or disapproval of acquisition of development rights by the State Properties Review Board.\n\nSee Sec. 22-26hh re bond authorization.\n\nSee Sec. 22-26ii re commissioner's powers to enter on restricted agricultural land."

              "(a) The Commissioner of Agriculture may establish a community farms program for the preservation of farmland that does not meet the criteria of the farmland preservation program established pursuant to section 22-26cc for reasons of size, soil quality or location but that may contribute to local economic activity through agricultural production. The commissioner may purchase up to one hundred per cent of the value of development rights directly from an eligible owner, or may acquire development rights on qualifying farmland jointly with a municipality, subject to the appraisal and review required by the regulations adopted pursuant to this section. For the purposes of this section, “development rights” and “owner” have the same meanings as provided in section 22-26bb .",
              "(b) If the Commissioner of Agriculture establishes a program in accordance with subsection (a) of this subsection, the commissioner shall, in consultation with the Farmland Preservation Advisory Board established under section 22-26 ll , establish criteria for said program. Such criteria shall give preference to farms that produce food or fiber, and at a minimum shall consider (1) the probability that the land will be sold for nonagricultural purposes, (2) the current productivity of the land and the likelihood of continued productivity of such land, (3) the suitability of the land for agricultural use, including whether the soil is classified as locally important soils by the United States Department of Agriculture, and (4) the demonstrated level of community support for preservation of the parcel. The commissioner shall, in consultation with said board, consider mechanisms that encourage continuation of the land in agricultural production to maintain its long-term availability and affordability for future generations of farmers, including, but not limited to, deed restrictions or stewardship requirements.",
              "(c) Upon the acquisition by the commissioner of the development rights to agricultural land pursuant to this section, the commissioner shall cause to be filed in the appropriate land records and in the office of the Secretary of the State a notice of such acquisition which shall set forth a description of the agricultural land as will be sufficient to give any prospective purchaser of such agricultural land or creditor of the owner thereof notice of such restriction. Upon such filing, the owner of such agricultural land shall not be permitted to exercise development rights with respect to such land, and such development rights shall be considered and deemed dedicated to the state in perpetuity, except as hereinafter provided. If restricted land is to be sold, the owner shall notify the commissioner, in writing, of such impending sale not more than ninety days before transfer of title to the land and shall provide the commissioner with the name and address of the new owner.",

The Commissioner of Agriculture, in consultation with such advisory groups as the Commissioner of Agriculture may appoint, may approve (1) a petition by the owner of the restricted agricultural land to remove such restriction provided such petition is approved by resolution of the legislative body of the town, or (2) a petition by the legislative body of the town in which such land is situated to remove such restriction provided such petition is approved in writing by said owner. Upon approval of such a petition by the Commissioner of Agriculture, the legislative body of the town shall submit to the qualified voters of such town the question of removing the agricultural restriction from such land or a part thereof, at a referendum held at a regular election or a special election warned and called for that purpose. In the event a majority of those voting at such referendum are in favor of such removal, the restriction shall be removed from the agricultural land upon filing of the certified results of such referendum in the land records and the office of the Secretary of the State, and the Commissioner of Agriculture shall convey the development rights to such owner provided such owner shall pay the Commissioner of Agriculture an amount equal to the value of such rights. Such petition shall set forth the facts and circumstances upon which the Commissioner of Agriculture shall consider approval, and said commissioner shall deny such approval unless said commissioner determines that the public interest is such that there is an overriding necessity to relinquish control of the development rights. The Commissioner of Agriculture shall hold at least one public hearing prior to the initiation of any proceedings hereunder. The expenses, if any, of the hearing and the referendum shall be borne by the petitioner. In the event that the state sells any development rights under the procedure provided in this subsection, it shall receive the value of such rights.",
              "(e) Whenever the Commissioner of Agriculture acquires the development rights of any agricultural land pursuant to this section and the purchase price of such development rights is ten thousand dollars or more, said commissioner and the owner of such land may enter into a written agreement which provides for the payment of the purchase price in two or three annual installments, but no interest shall be paid on any unpaid balance of such purchase price.",
              "(f) Whenever the commissioner acquires the development rights to any agricultural land, and any municipality in which all or part of the land is situated paid a part of the purchase price from a fund established pursuant to section 7-131q , such municipality and the state may jointly own the development rights. The land may be released from its agricultural restriction in accordance with the provisions of subsection (d) of this section. The commissioner shall adopt regulations, in accordance with the provisions of chapter 54, establishing procedures for the joint acquisition of development rights to agricultural land.",
              "(g) The acquisition of the development rights to any agricultural land by the commissioner shall not be deemed to be ownership of such land and the state shall not be liable for pollution or contamination of such land and no person may bring a civil action against the state for damages resulting from pollution or contamination of such agricultural land.",
              "(h) The commissioner may issue a letter of intent requesting the assistance of a nonprofit organization, as defined in Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, or any subsequent corresponding internal revenue code of the United States, as from time to time amended, in acquiring the development rights to certain agricultural land. If such organization acquires such rights it may sell them to the commissioner based on a purchase agreement. Such agreement may include reimbursement for reasonable expenses incurred in the acquisition of the rights as well as payment for the rights. The commissioner may enter into joint ownership agreements to acquire the development rights to any qualified agricultural land with any nonprofit organization, as defined in Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, or any subsequent corresponding internal revenue code of the United States, as from time to time amended, provided the mission of such nonprofit organization is the permanent protection of agricultural land for the purposes of continued agricultural use.",

Additionally, such conservation plan shall require the establishment of model pollinator habitat, as described in section 22-90b . Any instrument by which the commissioner acquires such rights and for which any such funds are used may provide for a contingent right in the United States of America in the event that the state of Connecticut fails to enforce any of the terms of its rights acquired under this section which failure shall be determined by the United States Secretary of Agriculture. Such contingent right shall entitle the United States Secretary of Agriculture to enforce any rights acquired by the state under this section by any authority provided under law. Such instrument may provide that such rights shall become vested in the United States of America in the event that the state of Connecticut attempts to terminate, transfer or otherwise divest itself of any such rights without the prior consent of the United States Secretary of Agriculture and payment of consideration to the United States and may further provide that title to such rights may be held by the United States of America at any time at the request of the United States Secretary of Agriculture. In connection with such an agreement, the commissioner may hold the United States harmless from any action based on negligence in the procurement or management of any rights acquired under this section and may assure that proper title evidence is secured, that the title is insured to the amount of the federal cost paid for the interest of the United States of America and that, in the event of a failure of title, as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction, and payment of insurance to the state, the state will reimburse the United States for the amount of the federal cost paid.",

Each manufacturer licensee shall be responsible for all costs of disposal of hemp samples and any hemp produced by such licensee that violates the provisions of this section or any regulation adopted pursuant to this section. Any cannabis that exceeds the prescribed THC concentration allowable in hemp or hemp products shall be immediately embargoed by such manufacturer and clearly labeled as adulterated by such licensee and such licensee shall immediately notify both the Department of Consumer Protection and the Department of Agriculture, in writing, of such adulterated product.

The authority may charge the owner of the animal being tested for the cost of such test. The commissioner may, within available appropriations, on the commissioner's own initiative and at state expense test animals participating in such contest on a random basis for the presence of drugs. The authority in charge of such contest shall provide well-lighted facilities, removed from the public, for the administration of such test. The owner or trainer or both the owner and trainer of any animal to be tested shall submit such animal for testing and shall provide assistance and proper restraint for confining such animal for and during the administration of such test.

No prize money shall be paid until the result of the test is known. If any such test reveals the presence of a drug in any such animal, such animal shall be disqualified to participate in such contest, shall be ineligible to receive any prize money awarded in such contest and shall be barred from participating in any such contest held in this state for a period of one year from the date of receipt by the commissioner of the results of the test.

The owner of any such animal shall reimburse the authority in charge of such animal drawing contest or the state, as the case may be, for the expense of such test.

The authority may charge the owner of the animal being tested for the cost of such test. The commissioner may, within available appropriations, on the commissioner's own initiative and at state expense test animals participating in such contest on a random basis for the presence of drugs.

The owner or trainer or both the owner and trainer of any animal to be tested shall submit such animal for testing and shall provide assistance and proper restraint for confining such animal for and during the administration of such test. If the animal continues to resist the test after restraint is applied and the person administering the test determines a danger exists to the animal or persons present at the test, an alternative test shall be administered. No prize money shall be paid until the result of the test is known. If any such test reveals the presence of a drug in any such animal, such animal shall be disqualified to participate in such contest, shall be ineligible to receive any prize money awarded in such contest and shall be barred from participating in any such contest held in this state for a period of one year from the date of receipt by the commissioner of the results of the test.

              "The Northeast Interstate Dairy Compact is hereby entered into and enacted into law, subject to the provisions of section 8.1 of the compact. The compact is as follows:",
              "ARTICLE I.",
              "STATEMENT OF PURPOSE, FINDINGS AND DECLARATION OF POLICY",
              "Sec. 1.1. Statement of purpose, findings and declaration of policy. The purpose of this compact is to recognize by constitutional prerequisite the interstate character of the northeast dairy industry and to form an interstate commission for the northeast region. The mission of the commission is to take such steps as are necessary to assure the continued viability of dairy farming in the northeast and to assure consumers of an adequate, local supply of pure and wholesome milk.",
              "The participating states find and declare that the dairy industry is the paramount agricultural activity of the northeast, and further find that dairy farms and associated suppliers, marketers, processors and retailers are an integral component of the region's economy and that their ability to provide a stable, local supply of pure, wholesome milk is a matter of great importance to the health and welfare of the region.",
              "The participating states further find that dairy farms are essential to the region's rural communities and character and that such farms preserve open spaces, sculpt the landscape and provide the land base for a diversity of recreational pursuits and also provide a major draw for our tourist industries.",
              "By entering into this compact, the participating states affirm that their ability to regulate the price which northeast dairy farmers receive for their product is essential to the public interest and that assurance of a fair and equitable price for dairy farmers ensures their ability to provide milk to the market and the vitality of the northeast dairy industry, with all the associated benefits.",
              "The participating states find that recent, dramatic price fluctuations, with a pronounced downward trend, threaten the viability and stability of the northeast dairy region and that historically, individual state regulatory action has been an effective emergency remedy available to farmers confronting a distressed market. The participating states further find that the federal order system, implemented by the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937, established only minimum prices for dairy products without preempting the power of states to regulate milk prices above minimum levels so established and that based on this authority, each state in the region has individually attempted to implement at least one regulatory program in response to the current dairy industry crisis.",
              "The participating states find that in today's regional dairy marketplace, cooperative, rather than individual state action may address more effectively the market disarray and that under our constitutional system, properly authorized, states acting cooperatively may exercise more power to regulate interstate commerce than they may assert individually without such authority. For this reason, the participating states invoke their authority to act in common agreement, with the consent of Congress, under the compact clause of the Constitution.",
              "In establishing their constitutional regulatory authority over the region's fluid milk market by this compact, the participating states declare that their purpose shall be that this compact neither displace the federal order system nor encourage the merging of federal orders. If the federal order system is discontinued, the interstate commission is authorized to regulate the marketplace in replacement of the order system. This contingent authority does not anticipate such a change, however, and should not be so construed. It is only provided should developments in the market other than establishment of this compact result in discontinuance of the order system.",
              "ARTICLE II.",
              "DEFINITIONS AND RULES OF CONSTRUCTION",
              "Sec. 2.1. Definitions. For the purposes of this compact, and of any supplemental or concurring legislation enacted pursuant thereto, except as may be otherwise required by the context:",

Commission regulations may exempt plants having such distribution or receipts in amounts less than the limits defined therein;",
              "(8) “Compact over-order price” means a minimum price required to be paid to producers for Class I milk established by the commission in regulations adopted pursuant to articles IV and V of this compact, which is above the price established in federal marketing orders or by state farm price regulation in the regulated area. Such price may apply throughout the region or in any part or parts thereof as defined in the regulations of the commission;",
              "(9) “Commission marketing order” means regulations adopted by the commission pursuant to sections 4.3 and 5.1 of this compact in place of a terminated federal marketing order or state dairy regulation. Such order may apply throughout the region or in any part or parts thereof as defined in the regulations of the commission. Such order may establish minimum prices for any or all classes of milk;",
              "(10) “Milk” means the lacteal secretion of cows and includes all skim, butterfat, or other constituents obtained from separation or any other process. The term is used in its broadest sense and may be further defined by the commission for regulatory purposes;",

              "Sec. 2.2. Rules of construction. (a) This compact shall not be construed to displace existing federal milk marketing orders or state dairy regulation in the region but to supplement them. In the event some or all federal orders in the region are discontinued, the compact shall be construed to provide the commission the power to replace them with one or more commission marketing orders pursuant to this compact.",
              "(b) This compact shall be construed liberally in order to achieve the purposes and intent enunciated in section 1.1. It is the intent of this compact to establish a basic structure by which the commission may achieve those purposes through the application, adaptation and development of the regulatory techniques historically associated with milk marketing and to afford the commission broad flexibility to devise regulatory mechanisms to achieve the purposes of this compact. In accordance with this intent, the technical terms which are associated with federal milk market order regulation and which have acquired commonly understood general meanings are not defined herein but the commission may further define the terms used in this compact and develop additional concepts and define additional terms as it may find appropriate to achieve its purposes.",
              "ARTICLE III.",
              "COMMISSION ESTABLISHED",
              "Sec. 3.1. Commission established. There is hereby created a commission to administer the compact, composed of delegations from each state in the region. A delegation shall include not less than three nor more than five persons. Each delegation shall include at least one dairy farmer who is engaged in the production of milk at the time of appointment or reappointment and one consumer representative. Delegation members shall be residents and voters of, and subject to such confirmation process as is provided for in, the appointing state. Delegation members shall serve no more than three consecutive terms with no single term of more than four years and be subject to removal for cause. In all other respects, delegation members shall serve in accordance with the laws of the state represented. The compensation, if any, of the members of a state delegation shall be determined and paid by each state, but their expenses shall be paid by the commission. Each state delegation shall be entitled to one vote in the conduct of the commission's affairs.",
              "Sec. 3.2. Voting requirements. All actions taken by the commission, except for the establishment or termination of an over-order price or commission marketing order and the adoption, amendment or rescission of the commission's bylaws, shall be by majority vote of the delegations present. Establishment or termination of an over-order price or commission marketing order shall require at least a two-thirds vote of the delegations present. A majority of the delegations from the participating states shall constitute a quorum for the conduct of the commission's business.",
              "Sec. 3.3. Administration and management. (a) The commission shall elect annually from among the members of the participating state delegations a chairperson, a vice-chairperson, and a treasurer. The commission shall appoint an executive director and fix his or her duties and compensation. The executive director shall serve at the pleasure of the commission, and, together with the treasurer, shall be bonded in an amount determined by the commission. The commission may establish through its bylaws an executive committee composed of one member elected by each delegation.",
              "(b) The commission shall adopt bylaws for the conduct of its business by a two-thirds vote and shall have the power by the same vote to amend and rescind these bylaws. The commission shall publish its bylaws in convenient form with the appropriate agency or officer in each of the participating states. The bylaws shall provide for appropriate notice to the delegations of all commission meetings and hearings and of the business to be transacted at such meetings or hearings. Notice also shall be given to other agencies or officers of participating states as provided by the laws of those states.",
              "(c) The commission shall file an annual report with the Secretary of Agriculture of the United States, and with each of the participating states by submitting copies to the governor, both houses of the legislature, and the head of the state department having responsibilities for agriculture.",
              "(d) In addition to the powers and duties elsewhere prescribed in this compact, the commission shall have the power: (1) To sue and be sued in any state or federal court; (2) to have a seal and alter the same at pleasure; (3) to acquire, hold and dispose of real and personal property by gift, purchase, lease, license, or other similar manner, for its corporate purposes; (4) to borrow money and to issue notes, to provide for the rights of the holders thereof and to pledge the revenue of the commission as security therefor, subject to the provisions of section 7.1 of this compact; (5) to appoint such officers, agents and employees as it may deem necessary, prescribe their powers, duties and qualifications; and (6) to create and abolish such offices, employments and positions as it deems necessary for the purposes of the compact and provide for the removal, term, tenure, compensation, fringe benefits, pensions and retirement rights of its officers and employees. The commission may also retain personal services on contract basis.",
              "Sec. 3.4. Rule-making power. In addition to the power to promulgate a compact over-order price or commission marketing orders as provided by this compact, the commission is further empowered to make and enforce such additional rules and regulations in accordance with the provisions of the federal Administrative Procedure Act as it deems necessary to implement any provisions of this compact or to effectuate in any other respect the purposes of this compact.",

              "POWERS OF THE COMMISSION",
              "Sec. 4.1. Powers to promote regulatory uniformity, simplicity and interstate cooperation. The commission is hereby empowered to:",
              "(1) Investigate or provide for investigations or research projects designed to review the existing laws and regulations of the participating states, to consider their administration and costs, to measure their impact on the production and marketing of milk and their effects on the shipment of milk and milk products within the region;",
              "(2) Prepare and transmit to the participating states model dairy laws and regulations dealing with the inspection of farms and plants, sanitary codes, labels for dairy products and their imitations, standards for dairy products, license standards, producer security programs and fair trade laws;",
              "(3) Study and recommend to the participating states joint or cooperative programs for the administration of the dairy laws and regulations and to prepare estimates of cost savings and benefits of such programs;",
              "(4) Encourage the harmonious relationships between the various elements, conduct symposiums or conferences designed to improve industry relations or a better understanding of problems;",
              "(5) Prepare and release periodic reports on activities and results of the commission's efforts to the participating states;",
              "(6) Review the existing marketing system for milk and milk products and recommend changes in the existing structure for assembly and distribution of milk which may assist, improve or promote more efficient assembly and distribution of milk;",

              "(8) Examine current economic forces affecting producers, probable trends in production and consumption, the level of dairy farm prices in relation to costs, the financial conditions of dairy farmers and the need for an emergency order to relieve critical conditions on dairy farms.",
              "Sec. 4.2. Equitable farm prices. (a) The powers granted in this section and section 4.3 of this compact shall apply only to the establishment of a compact over-order price, so long as federal milk marketing orders remain in effect in the region. In the event that any or all such orders are terminated, this article shall authorize the commission to establish one or more commission marketing orders, as herein provided, in the region or parts thereof as defined in the order.",
              "(b) A compact over-order price established pursuant to this section shall apply only to Class I milk. Such over-order price shall not exceed one dollar and fifty cents per gallon. Beginning in 1990 and using that year as a base, the foregoing one dollar and fifty cents per gallon maximum shall be adjusted annually by the rate of change in the Consumer Price Index as reported by the Bureau of Labor Statistics of the United States Department of Labor. For purposes of the pooling and equalization of an over-order price, the value of milk used in other use classifications shall be calculated at the appropriate class price established pursuant to the applicable federal order or state dairy regulation and the value of unregulated milk shall be calculated in relation to the nearest prevailing class price in accordance with and subject to such adjustments as the commission may prescribe in regulations.",
              "(c) A commission marketing order shall apply to all classes and uses of milk.",
              "(d) The commission is hereby empowered to establish the minimum price for milk to be paid by pool plants, partially regulated plants and all other handlers receiving milk from producers located in a regulated area. This price shall be established either as a compact over-order price or by one or more commission marketing orders. Whenever such a price has been established by either type of regulation, the legal obligation to pay such price shall be determined solely by the terms and purpose of the regulation without regard to the situs of the transfer of title, possession or any other factors not related to the purposes of the regulation and this compact. Producer/handlers, as defined in an applicable federal milk marketing order, shall not be subject to a compact over-order price. The commission shall provide for similar treatment of producer/handlers under commission marketing orders.",
              "(e) In determining the price, the commission shall consider the balance between production and consumption of milk and milk products in the regulated area, the costs of production including, but not limited to the price of feed, the cost of labor including the reasonable value of the producer's own labor and management, machinery expense and interest expense, the prevailing price for milk outside the regulated area, the purchasing power of the public and the price necessary to yield a reasonable return to the producer and distributor.",
              "(f) When establishing a compact over-order price, the commission shall take such action as necessary and feasible to ensure that the over-order price does not create an incentive for producers to generate additional supplies of milk.",
              "(g) The commission shall whenever possible enter into agreements with state or federal agencies for exchange of information or services for the purpose of reducing regulatory burden and cost of administering the compact. The commission may reimburse other agencies for the reasonable cost of providing these services.",

              "(3) With respect to an over-order minimum price, provisions establishing or providing a method for establishing such minimum price for Class I milk;",
              "(4) Provisions for establishing either an over-order price or a commission marketing order may make use of any reasonable method for establishing such price or prices including flat pricing and formula pricing. Provision may also be made for location adjustments, zone differentials and for competitive credits with respect to regulated handlers who market outside the regulated area;",
              "(5) Provisions for the payment to all producers and associations of producers delivering milk to all handlers of uniform prices for all milk so delivered, irrespective of the uses made of such milk by the individual handler to whom it is delivered, or for the payment of producers delivering milk to the same handler of uniform prices for all milk delivered by them;",
              "(A) With respect to regulations establishing a compact over-order price, the commission may establish one equalization pool within the regulated area for the sole purpose of equalizing returns to producers throughout the regulated area;",
              "(B) With respect to any commission marketing order, as defined in section 2.1 of this compact, which replaces one or more terminated federal orders or state dairy regulation, the marketing area of now separate state or federal orders shall not be merged without the affirmative consent of each state, voting through its delegation, which is partly or wholly included within any such new marketing area;",
              "(6) Provisions requiring persons who bring Class I milk into the regulated area to make compensatory payments with respect to all such milk to the extent necessary to equalize the cost of milk purchased by handlers subject to a compact over-order price or commission marketing order. No such provisions shall discriminate against milk producers outside the regulated area. The provisions of compensatory payments may require payment of the difference between the Class I price required to be paid for such milk in the state of production by a federal milk marketing order or state dairy regulation and the Class I price for such milk, established by the compact over-order price or commission marketing order;",
              "(7) Provisions specially governing the pricing and pooling of milk handled by partially regulated plants;",
              "(8) Provisions requiring that the account of any person regulated under a compact over-order price shall be adjusted for any payments made to or received by such persons with respect to a producer settlement fund of any federal or state milk marketing order or other state dairy regulation within the regulated area;",
              "(9) Provisions requiring the payment by handlers of an assessment to cover the costs of the administration and enforcement of such order pursuant to article VII of this compact;",
              "(10) Provisions for reimbursement to participants in the Women, Infants and Children Special Supplemental Food Program of the United States Child Nutrition Act of 1966; and",

Before promulgation of any regulations establishing a compact over-order price or commission marketing order, including any provision with respect to milk supply under section 4.2(f), or amendment thereof, as provided in Article IV of this compact, the commission shall conduct an informal rule-making proceeding to provide interested persons with an opportunity to present data and views. Such rule-making proceeding shall be governed by section four of the Federal Administrative Procedure Act, as amended (5 USC S.553). In addition, the commission shall, to the extent practicable, publish notice of rule-making proceedings in the official register of each participating state. Before the initial adoption of regulations establishing a compact over-order price or a commission marketing order and thereafter before any amendment with regard to prices or assessments, the commission shall hold a public hearing. The commission may commence a rule-making proceeding on its own initiative or may in its sole discretion act upon the petition of any person including individual milk producers, any organization of milk producers or handlers, general farm organizations, consumer or public interest groups and local, state or federal officials.",

(a) For the purpose of ascertaining whether the issuance or amendment of regulations establishing a compact over-order price or a commission marketing order, including any provision with respect to milk supply under section 4.2(f), is approved by producers, the commission shall conduct a referendum among producers. The referendum shall be held in a timely manner, as determined by regulation of the commission. The terms and conditions of the proposed order or amendment shall be described by the commission in the ballot used in the conduct of the referendum, but the nature, content, or extent of such description shall not be a basis for attacking the legality of the order or any action relating thereto.",
              "(b) An order or amendment shall be deemed approved by producers if the commission determines that it is approved by at least two-thirds of the producers who, during a representative period determined by the commission, have been engaged in the production of milk the price of which would be regulated under the proposed order or amendment.",
              "(c) For purposes of any referendum, the commission shall consider the approval or disapproval by any cooperative association of producers, qualified under the provisions of the Act of Congress of February 18, 1922, as amended, known as the Capper-Volstead Act, bona fide engaged in marketing milk, or in rendering services for or advancing the interests of producers of such commodity, as the approval or disapproval of the producers who are members or stockholders in, or under contract with, such cooperative association of producers, except as provided in subdivision (1) hereof and subject to the provisions of subdivisions (2) to (5), inclusive.",
              "(1) No cooperative which has been formed to act as a common marketing agency for both cooperatives and individual producers shall be qualified to block vote for either.",
              "(2) Any cooperative which is qualified to block vote shall, before submitting its approval or disapproval in any referendum, give prior written notice to each of its producers who are members or stockholders in, or under contract with, the cooperative as to whether and how it intends to cast its vote. The notice shall be given in a timely manner and in the form prescribed by the commission.",
              "(3) Any producer may obtain a ballot from the commission in order to register approval or disapproval of the proposed order.",
              "(4) A producer who is a member of a cooperative which has provided notice of its intent to approve or not to approve a proposed order and who obtains a ballot and with such ballot expresses his approval or disapproval of the proposed order, shall notify the commission as to the name of the cooperative of which he or she is a member and the commission shall remove such producer's name from the list certified by such cooperative with its corporate vote.",
              "(5) In order to insure that all milk producers are informed regarding a proposed order, the commission shall notify all milk producers that an order is being considered and that each producer may register his approval or disapproval with the commission either directly or through his or her cooperative.",
              "Sec. 5.4. Termination of over-order price or marketing order.

The commission may promulgate regulations further defining the confidentiality of information pursuant to this section. Nothing in this section shall be deemed to prohibit (1) the issuance of general statements based upon the reports of a number of handlers, which do not identify the information furnished by any person, or (2) the publication by direction of the commission of the name of any person violating any regulation of the commission, together with a statement of the particular provisions violated by such person.",

If the court determines that such ruling is not in accordance with law, it shall remand such proceedings to the commission with directions either (1) to make such ruling as the court shall determine to be in accordance with law, or (2) to take such further action as, in its opinion, the law requires. The pendency of any proceeding instituted pursuant to this subdivision shall not impede, hinder or delay the commission from obtaining relief pursuant to section 6.3 of this compact.

            "text": "The Northeast Interstate Dairy Compact is hereby entered into and enacted into law, subject to the provisions of section 8.1 of the compact. The compact is as follows:\n\nARTICLE I.\n\nSTATEMENT OF PURPOSE, FINDINGS AND DECLARATION OF POLICY\n\nSec. 1.1. Statement of purpose, findings and declaration of policy. The purpose of this compact is to recognize by constitutional prerequisite the interstate character of the northeast dairy industry and to form an interstate commission for the northeast region. The mission of the commission is to take such steps as are necessary to assure the continued viability of dairy farming in the northeast and to assure consumers of an adequate, local supply of pure and wholesome milk.\n\nThe participating states find and declare that the dairy industry is the paramount agricultural activity of the northeast, and further find that dairy farms and associated suppliers, marketers, processors and retailers are an integral component of the region's economy and that their ability to provide a stable, local supply of pure, wholesome milk is a matter of great importance to the health and welfare of the region.\n\nThe participating states further find that dairy farms are essential to the region's rural communities and character and that such farms preserve open spaces, sculpt the landscape and provide the land base for a diversity of recreational pursuits and also provide a major draw for our tourist industries.\n\nBy entering into this compact, the participating states affirm that their ability to regulate the price which northeast dairy farmers receive for their product is essential to the public interest and that assurance of a fair and equitable price for dairy farmers ensures their ability to provide milk to the market and the vitality of the northeast dairy industry, with all the associated benefits.\n\nThe participating states find that recent, dramatic price fluctuations, with a pronounced downward trend, threaten the viability and stability of the northeast dairy region and that historically, individual state regulatory action has been an effective emergency remedy available to farmers confronting a distressed market. The participating states further find that the federal order system, implemented by the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937, established only minimum prices for dairy products without preempting the power of states to regulate milk prices above minimum levels so established and that based on this authority, each state in the region has individually attempted to implement at least one regulatory program in response to the current dairy industry crisis.\n\nThe participating states find that in today's regional dairy marketplace, cooperative, rather than individual state action may address more effectively the market disarray and that under our constitutional system, properly authorized, states acting cooperatively may exercise more power to regulate interstate commerce than they may assert individually without such authority. For this reason, the participating states invoke their authority to act in common agreement, with the consent of Congress, under the compact clause of the Constitution.\n\nIn establishing their constitutional regulatory authority over the region's fluid milk market by this compact, the participating states declare that their purpose shall be that this compact neither displace the federal order system nor encourage the merging of federal orders. If the federal order system is discontinued, the interstate commission is authorized to regulate the marketplace in replacement of the order system. This contingent authority does not anticipate such a change, however, and should not be so construed. It is only provided should developments in the market other than establishment of this compact result in discontinuance of the order system.\n\nARTICLE II.\n\nDEFINITIONS AND RULES OF CONSTRUCTION\n\nSec. 2.1. Definitions. For the purposes of this compact, and of any supplemental or concurring legislation enacted pursuant thereto, except as may be otherwise required by the context:\n\n(1) “Commission” means the commission established by this compact;\n\n(2) “Compact” means this interstate compact;\n\n(3) “Region” means the territorial limits of the states which are or become parties to this compact;\n\n(4) “Participating state” means a state which has become a party to this compact by the enactment of concurring legislation;\n\n(5) “Regulated area” means any area within the region governed by and defined in regulations establishing a compact over-order price or commission marketing order;\n\n(6) “Pool plant” means any milk plant located in a regulated area;\n\n(7) “Partially regulated plant” means a milk plant not located in a regulated area but having Class I distribution within such area, or receipts from producers located in such area. Commission regulations may exempt plants having such distribution or receipts in amounts less than the limits defined therein;\n\n(8) “Compact over-order price” means a minimum price required to be paid to producers for Class I milk established by the commission in regulations adopted pursuant to articles IV and V of this compact, which is above the price established in federal marketing orders or by state farm price regulation in the regulated area. Such price may apply throughout the region or in any part or parts thereof as defined in the regulations of the commission;\n\n(9) “Commission marketing order” means regulations adopted by the commission pursuant to sections 4.3 and 5.1 of this compact in place of a terminated federal marketing order or state dairy regulation. Such order may apply throughout the region or in any part or parts thereof as defined in the regulations of the commission. Such order may establish minimum prices for any or all classes of milk;\n\n(10) “Milk” means the lacteal secretion of cows and includes all skim, butterfat, or other constituents obtained from separation or any other process. The term is used in its broadest sense and may be further defined by the commission for regulatory purposes;\n\n(11) “Class I milk” means milk disposed of in fluid form or as a fluid milk product, subject to further definition in accordance with the principles expressed in subsection (b) of section 2.2 of this compact; and\n\n(12) “State dairy regulation” means any state regulation of dairy prices, and associated assessments, whether by statute, marketing order or otherwise.\n\nSec. 2.2. Rules of construction. (a) This compact shall not be construed to displace existing federal milk marketing orders or state dairy regulation in the region but to supplement them. In the event some or all federal orders in the region are discontinued, the compact shall be construed to provide the commission the power to replace them with one or more commission marketing orders pursuant to this compact.\n\n(b) This compact shall be construed liberally in order to achieve the purposes and intent enunciated in section 1.1. It is the intent of this compact to establish a basic structure by which the commission may achieve those purposes through the application, adaptation and development of the regulatory techniques historically associated with milk marketing and to afford the commission broad flexibility to devise regulatory mechanisms to achieve the purposes of this compact. In accordance with this intent, the technical terms which are associated with federal milk market order regulation and which have acquired commonly understood general meanings are not defined herein but the commission may further define the terms used in this compact and develop additional concepts and define additional terms as it may find appropriate to achieve its purposes.\n\nARTICLE III.\n\nCOMMISSION ESTABLISHED\n\nSec. 3.1. Commission established. There is hereby created a commission to administer the compact, composed of delegations from each state in the region. A delegation shall include not less than three nor more than five persons. Each delegation shall include at least one dairy farmer who is engaged in the production of milk at the time of appointment or reappointment and one consumer representative. Delegation members shall be residents and voters of, and subject to such confirmation process as is provided for in, the appointing state. Delegation members shall serve no more than three consecutive terms with no single term of more than four years and be subject to removal for cause. In all other respects, delegation members shall serve in accordance with the laws of the state represented. The compensation, if any, of the members of a state delegation shall be determined and paid by each state, but their expenses shall be paid by the commission. Each state delegation shall be entitled to one vote in the conduct of the commission's affairs.\n\nSec. 3.2. Voting requirements. All actions taken by the commission, except for the establishment or termination of an over-order price or commission marketing order and the adoption, amendment or rescission of the commission's bylaws, shall be by majority vote of the delegations present. Establishment or termination of an over-order price or commission marketing order shall require at least a two-thirds vote of the delegations present. A majority of the delegations from the participating states shall constitute a quorum for the conduct of the commission's business.\n\nSec. 3.3. Administration and management. (a) The commission shall elect annually from among the members of the participating state delegations a chairperson, a vice-chairperson, and a treasurer. The commission shall appoint an executive director and fix his or her duties and compensation. The executive director shall serve at the pleasure of the commission, and, together with the treasurer, shall be bonded in an amount determined by the commission. The commission may establish through its bylaws an executive committee composed of one member elected by each delegation.\n\n(b) The commission shall adopt bylaws for the conduct of its business by a two-thirds vote and shall have the power by the same vote to amend and rescind these bylaws. The commission shall publish its bylaws in convenient form with the appropriate agency or officer in each of the participating states. The bylaws shall provide for appropriate notice to the delegations of all commission meetings and hearings and of the business to be transacted at such meetings or hearings. Notice also shall be given to other agencies or officers of participating states as provided by the laws of those states.\n\n(c) The commission shall file an annual report with the Secretary of Agriculture of the United States, and with each of the participating states by submitting copies to the governor, both houses of the legislature, and the head of the state department having responsibilities for agriculture.\n\n(d) In addition to the powers and duties elsewhere prescribed in this compact, the commission shall have the power: (1) To sue and be sued in any state or federal court; (2) to have a seal and alter the same at pleasure; (3) to acquire, hold and dispose of real and personal property by gift, purchase, lease, license, or other similar manner, for its corporate purposes; (4) to borrow money and to issue notes, to provide for the rights of the holders thereof and to pledge the revenue of the commission as security therefor, subject to the provisions of section 7.1 of this compact; (5) to appoint such officers, agents and employees as it may deem necessary, prescribe their powers, duties and qualifications; and (6) to create and abolish such offices, employments and positions as it deems necessary for the purposes of the compact and provide for the removal, term, tenure, compensation, fringe benefits, pensions and retirement rights of its officers and employees. The commission may also retain personal services on contract basis.\n\nSec. 3.4. Rule-making power. In addition to the power to promulgate a compact over-order price or commission marketing orders as provided by this compact, the commission is further empowered to make and enforce such additional rules and regulations in accordance with the provisions of the federal Administrative Procedure Act as it deems necessary to implement any provisions of this compact or to effectuate in any other respect the purposes of this compact.\n\nARTICLE IV.\n\nPOWERS OF THE COMMISSION\n\nSec. 4.1. Powers to promote regulatory uniformity, simplicity and interstate cooperation. The commission is hereby empowered to:\n\n(1) Investigate or provide for investigations or research projects designed to review the existing laws and regulations of the participating states, to consider their administration and costs, to measure their impact on the production and marketing of milk and their effects on the shipment of milk and milk products within the region;\n\n(2) Prepare and transmit to the participating states model dairy laws and regulations dealing with the inspection of farms and plants, sanitary codes, labels for dairy products and their imitations, standards for dairy products, license standards, producer security programs and fair trade laws;\n\n(3) Study and recommend to the participating states joint or cooperative programs for the administration of the dairy laws and regulations and to prepare estimates of cost savings and benefits of such programs;\n\n(4) Encourage the harmonious relationships between the various elements, conduct symposiums or conferences designed to improve industry relations or a better understanding of problems;\n\n(5) Prepare and release periodic reports on activities and results of the commission's efforts to the participating states;\n\n(6) Review the existing marketing system for milk and milk products and recommend changes in the existing structure for assembly and distribution of milk which may assist, improve or promote more efficient assembly and distribution of milk;\n\n(7) Investigate costs and charges for producing, hauling, handling, processing, distributing, selling and for all other services performed with respect to milk; and\n\n(8) Examine current economic forces affecting producers, probable trends in production and consumption, the level of dairy farm prices in relation to costs, the financial conditions of dairy farmers and the need for an emergency order to relieve critical conditions on dairy farms.\n\nSec. 4.2. Equitable farm prices. (a) The powers granted in this section and section 4.3 of this compact shall apply only to the establishment of a compact over-order price, so long as federal milk marketing orders remain in effect in the region. In the event that any or all such orders are terminated, this article shall authorize the commission to establish one or more commission marketing orders, as herein provided, in the region or parts thereof as defined in the order.\n\n(b) A compact over-order price established pursuant to this section shall apply only to Class I milk. Such over-order price shall not exceed one dollar and fifty cents per gallon. Beginning in 1990 and using that year as a base, the foregoing one dollar and fifty cents per gallon maximum shall be adjusted annually by the rate of change in the Consumer Price Index as reported by the Bureau of Labor Statistics of the United States Department of Labor. For purposes of the pooling and equalization of an over-order price, the value of milk used in other use classifications shall be calculated at the appropriate class price established pursuant to the applicable federal order or state dairy regulation and the value of unregulated milk shall be calculated in relation to the nearest prevailing class price in accordance with and subject to such adjustments as the commission may prescribe in regulations.\n\n(c) A commission marketing order shall apply to all classes and uses of milk.\n\n(d) The commission is hereby empowered to establish the minimum price for milk to be paid by pool plants, partially regulated plants and all other handlers receiving milk from producers located in a regulated area. This price shall be established either as a compact over-order price or by one or more commission marketing orders. Whenever such a price has been established by either type of regulation, the legal obligation to pay such price shall be determined solely by the terms and purpose of the regulation without regard to the situs of the transfer of title, possession or any other factors not related to the purposes of the regulation and this compact. Producer/handlers, as defined in an applicable federal milk marketing order, shall not be subject to a compact over-order price. The commission shall provide for similar treatment of producer/handlers under commission marketing orders.\n\n(e) In determining the price, the commission shall consider the balance between production and consumption of milk and milk products in the regulated area, the costs of production including, but not limited to the price of feed, the cost of labor including the reasonable value of the producer's own labor and management, machinery expense and interest expense, the prevailing price for milk outside the regulated area, the purchasing power of the public and the price necessary to yield a reasonable return to the producer and distributor.\n\n(f) When establishing a compact over-order price, the commission shall take such action as necessary and feasible to ensure that the over-order price does not create an incentive for producers to generate additional supplies of milk.\n\n(g) The commission shall whenever possible enter into agreements with state or federal agencies for exchange of information or services for the purpose of reducing regulatory burden and cost of administering the compact. The commission may reimburse other agencies for the reasonable cost of providing these services.\n\nSec. 4.3. Optional provisions for pricing orders. Regulations establishing a compact over-order price or a commission marketing order may contain, but shall not be limited to, any of the following:\n\n(1) Provisions classifying milk in accordance with the form in which or purpose for which it is used or creating a flat pricing program;\n\n(2) With respect to a commission marketing order only, provisions establishing or providing a method for establishing separate minimum prices for each use classification prescribed by the commission or a single minimum price for milk purchased from producers or associations of producers;\n\n(3) With respect to an over-order minimum price, provisions establishing or providing a method for establishing such minimum price for Class I milk;\n\n(4) Provisions for establishing either an over-order price or a commission marketing order may make use of any reasonable method for establishing such price or prices including flat pricing and formula pricing. Provision may also be made for location adjustments, zone differentials and for competitive credits with respect to regulated handlers who market outside the regulated area;\n\n(5) Provisions for the payment to all producers and associations of producers delivering milk to all handlers of uniform prices for all milk so delivered, irrespective of the uses made of such milk by the individual handler to whom it is delivered, or for the payment of producers delivering milk to the same handler of uniform prices for all milk delivered by them;\n\n(A) With respect to regulations establishing a compact over-order price, the commission may establish one equalization pool within the regulated area for the sole purpose of equalizing returns to producers throughout the regulated area;\n\n(B) With respect to any commission marketing order, as defined in section 2.1 of this compact, which replaces one or more terminated federal orders or state dairy regulation, the marketing area of now separate state or federal orders shall not be merged without the affirmative consent of each state, voting through its delegation, which is partly or wholly included within any such new marketing area;\n\n(6) Provisions requiring persons who bring Class I milk into the regulated area to make compensatory payments with respect to all such milk to the extent necessary to equalize the cost of milk purchased by handlers subject to a compact over-order price or commission marketing order. No such provisions shall discriminate against milk producers outside the regulated area. The provisions of compensatory payments may require payment of the difference between the Class I price required to be paid for such milk in the state of production by a federal milk marketing order or state dairy regulation and the Class I price for such milk, established by the compact over-order price or commission marketing order;\n\n(7) Provisions specially governing the pricing and pooling of milk handled by partially regulated plants;\n\n(8) Provisions requiring that the account of any person regulated under a compact over-order price shall be adjusted for any payments made to or received by such persons with respect to a producer settlement fund of any federal or state milk marketing order or other state dairy regulation within the regulated area;\n\n(9) Provisions requiring the payment by handlers of an assessment to cover the costs of the administration and enforcement of such order pursuant to article VII of this compact;\n\n(10) Provisions for reimbursement to participants in the Women, Infants and Children Special Supplemental Food Program of the United States Child Nutrition Act of 1966; and\n\n(11) Other provisions and requirements as the commission may find are necessary or appropriate to effectuate the purposes of this compact and to provide for the payment of fair and equitable minimum prices to producers.\n\nARTICLE V.\n\nRULE-MAKING PROCEDURE\n\nSec. 5.1. Rule-making procedure. Before promulgation of any regulations establishing a compact over-order price or commission marketing order, including any provision with respect to milk supply under section 4.2(f), or amendment thereof, as provided in Article IV of this compact, the commission shall conduct an informal rule-making proceeding to provide interested persons with an opportunity to present data and views. Such rule-making proceeding shall be governed by section four of the Federal Administrative Procedure Act, as amended (5 USC S.553). In addition, the commission shall, to the extent practicable, publish notice of rule-making proceedings in the official register of each participating state. Before the initial adoption of regulations establishing a compact over-order price or a commission marketing order and thereafter before any amendment with regard to prices or assessments, the commission shall hold a public hearing. The commission may commence a rule-making proceeding on its own initiative or may in its sole discretion act upon the petition of any person including individual milk producers, any organization of milk producers or handlers, general farm organizations, consumer or public interest groups and local, state or federal officials.\n\nSec. 5.2. Findings. In addition to the concise general statement of basis and purpose required by section 4(b) of the Federal Administrative Procedure Act, as amended, (5 USC S.553(c)), the commission shall make findings of fact with respect to:\n\n(1) Whether the public interest will be served by the establishment of minimum milk prices to dairy farmers under Article IV of this compact;\n\n(2) What level of prices will assure that producers receive a price sufficient to cover their costs of production and will elicit an adequate supply of milk for the inhabitants of the regulated area and for manufacturing purposes;\n\n(3) Whether the major provisions of the order, other than those fixing minimum milk prices, are in the public interest and are reasonably designed to achieve the purposes of the order; and\n\n(4) Whether the terms of the proposed regional order or amendment are approved by producers as provided in section 5.3 of this compact.\n\nSec. 5.3. Producer referendum. (a) For the purpose of ascertaining whether the issuance or amendment of regulations establishing a compact over-order price or a commission marketing order, including any provision with respect to milk supply under section 4.2(f), is approved by producers, the commission shall conduct a referendum among producers. The referendum shall be held in a timely manner, as determined by regulation of the commission. The terms and conditions of the proposed order or amendment shall be described by the commission in the ballot used in the conduct of the referendum, but the nature, content, or extent of such description shall not be a basis for attacking the legality of the order or any action relating thereto.\n\n(b) An order or amendment shall be deemed approved by producers if the commission determines that it is approved by at least two-thirds of the producers who, during a representative period determined by the commission, have been engaged in the production of milk the price of which would be regulated under the proposed order or amendment.\n\n(c) For purposes of any referendum, the commission shall consider the approval or disapproval by any cooperative association of producers, qualified under the provisions of the Act of Congress of February 18, 1922, as amended, known as the Capper-Volstead Act, bona fide engaged in marketing milk, or in rendering services for or advancing the interests of producers of such commodity, as the approval or disapproval of the producers who are members or stockholders in, or under contract with, such cooperative association of producers, except as provided in subdivision (1) hereof and subject to the provisions of subdivisions (2) to (5), inclusive.\n\n(1) No cooperative which has been formed to act as a common marketing agency for both cooperatives and individual producers shall be qualified to block vote for either.\n\n(2) Any cooperative which is qualified to block vote shall, before submitting its approval or disapproval in any referendum, give prior written notice to each of its producers who are members or stockholders in, or under contract with, the cooperative as to whether and how it intends to cast its vote. The notice shall be given in a timely manner and in the form prescribed by the commission.\n\n(3) Any producer may obtain a ballot from the commission in order to register approval or disapproval of the proposed order.\n\n(4) A producer who is a member of a cooperative which has provided notice of its intent to approve or not to approve a proposed order and who obtains a ballot and with such ballot expresses his approval or disapproval of the proposed order, shall notify the commission as to the name of the cooperative of which he or she is a member and the commission shall remove such producer's name from the list certified by such cooperative with its corporate vote.\n\n(5) In order to insure that all milk producers are informed regarding a proposed order, the commission shall notify all milk producers that an order is being considered and that each producer may register his approval or disapproval with the commission either directly or through his or her cooperative.\n\nSec. 5.4. Termination of over-order price or marketing order. (a) The commission shall terminate any regulations establishing an over-order price or commission marketing order issued under this article whenever it finds that such order or price obstructs or does not tend to effectuate the declared policy of this compact.\n\n(b) The commission shall terminate any regulations establishing an over-order price or a commission marketing order issued under this article whenever it finds that such termination is favored by a majority of the producers who, during a representative period determined by the commission, have been engaged in the production of milk the price of which is regulated by such order; but such termination shall be effective only if announced on or before such date as may be specified in such over-order price or commission marketing order.\n\n(c) The termination or suspension of any order or provision thereof, shall not be considered an order within the meaning of this article and shall require no hearing, but shall comply with the requirements for informal rule-making prescribed by section four of the Federal Administrative Procedure Act, as amended (5 USC 553).\n\nARTICLE VI.\n\nENFORCEMENT\n\nSec. 6.1. Records. Reports. Access to Premises. (a) The commission may by rule and regulation prescribe record keeping and reporting requirements for all regulated persons. For purposes of the administration and enforcement of this compact, the commission is authorized to examine the books and records relating to the milk business of any regulated person and for that purpose, the commission's properly designated officers, employees or agents shall have full access during normal business hours to the premises and records of all regulated persons.\n\n(b) Information furnished to or acquired by the commission officers, employees, or its agents pursuant to this section shall be confidential and not subject to disclosure except to the extent that the commission deems disclosure to be necessary in any administrative or judicial proceeding involving the administration or enforcement of this compact, an over-order price, a commission marketing order or other regulations of the commission. The commission may promulgate regulations further defining the confidentiality of information pursuant to this section. Nothing in this section shall be deemed to prohibit (1) the issuance of general statements based upon the reports of a number of handlers, which do not identify the information furnished by any person, or (2) the publication by direction of the commission of the name of any person violating any regulation of the commission, together with a statement of the particular provisions violated by such person.\n\n(c) No officer, employee or agent of the commission shall intentionally disclose information, by inference or otherwise, which is made confidential pursuant to this section. Any person violating the provisions of this section shall upon conviction be subject to a fine of not more than one thousand dollars or to imprisonment for not more than one year, or to both, and shall be removed from office. The commission shall refer any allegation of a violation of this section to the appropriate state enforcement authority or United States Attorney.\n\nSec. 6.2. Subpoena, Hearings and Judicial Review. (a) The commission is hereby authorized and empowered by its members and its properly designated officers to administer oaths and issue subpoenas throughout all signatory states to compel the attendance of witnesses and the giving of testimony and the introduction of other evidence.\n\n(b) Any handler subject to an order may file a written petition with the commission stating that any such order or any provision of any such order or any obligation imposed in connection therewith is not in accordance with law and praying for a modification thereof or to be exempted therefrom. He shall thereupon be given an opportunity for a hearing upon such petition, in accordance with regulations made by the commission. After such hearing, the commission shall make a ruling upon the prayer of such petition which shall be final, if in accordance with law.\n\n(c) The district courts of the United States in any district in which such handler is an inhabitant, or has his principal place of business, are hereby vested with jurisdiction in equity to review such ruling provided a bill in equity for that purpose is filed within thirty days from the date of the entry of such ruling. Service of process in such proceedings may be had upon the commission by delivering to it a copy of the bill of complaint. If the court determines that such ruling is not in accordance with law, it shall remand such proceedings to the commission with directions either (1) to make such ruling as the court shall determine to be in accordance with law, or (2) to take such further action as, in its opinion, the law requires. The pendency of any proceeding instituted pursuant to this subdivision shall not impede, hinder or delay the commission from obtaining relief pursuant to section 6.3 of this compact. Any proceedings brought pursuant to section 6.3 of this compact, except where brought by way of counterclaim in proceedings instituted pursuant to this section, shall abate whenever a final decree has been rendered in proceedings between the same parties, and covering the same subject matter, instituted pursuant to this section.\n\nSec. 6.3. Enforcement with respect to handlers. (a) Any violation of the provisions of regulations establishing an over-order price or a commission marketing order or other regulations adopted pursuant to this compact shall:\n\n(1) Constitute a violation of the laws of each of the signatory states. Such violation shall render the violator subject to a civil penalty in an amount as may be prescribed by the laws of each of the participating states, recoverable in any state or federal court of competent jurisdiction. Each day such violation continues shall constitute a separate violation; and\n\n(2) Constitute grounds for the revocation of license or permit to engage in the milk business under the applicable laws of the participating states.\n\n(b) The commission shall enforce the provisions of this compact, regulations establishing an over-order price, a commission marketing order or other regulations adopted thereunder by:\n\n(1) Commencing an action for legal or equitable relief brought in the name of the commission in any state or federal court of competent jurisdiction; or\n\n(2) With the agreement of the appropriate state agency of a participating state, by referral to the state agency for enforcement by judicial or administrative remedy.\n\n(c) The commission may bring an action for an injunction to enforce the provisions of this compact or the order or regulations adopted thereunder without being compelled to allege or prove that an adequate remedy of law does not exist.\n\nARTICLE VII.\n\nFINANCE\n\nSec. 7.1. Finance of start-up and regular costs. (a) To provide for its start-up costs, the commission may borrow money pursuant to its general power under section 3.3(d)(4) of this compact. In order to finance the costs of administration and enforcement of this compact, including reimbursement of start-up costs, the commission is hereby empowered to collect an assessment from each handler who purchases milk from producers within the region. If imposed, the assessment shall be collected on a monthly basis for up to one year from the date the commission convenes, in an amount not to exceed one-tenth of one per cent of the applicable federal milk marketing order blend price per hundredweight of milk purchased from producers during the period of the assessment. The initial assessment may apply to the projected purchases of handlers for the two-month period following the date the commission convenes. In addition, if regulations establishing an over-order price or a commission marketing order are adopted, they may include an assessment for the specific purpose of their administration. Such regulations shall provide for establishment of a reserve for the commission's ongoing expenses.\n\n(b) The commission shall not pledge the credit of any participating state or of the United States. Notes issued by the commission and all other financial obligations incurred by it, shall be its sole responsibility and no participating state or the United States shall be liable therefor.\n\nSec. 7.2. Audit and accounts. (a) The commission shall keep accurate accounts of all receipts and disbursements, which shall be subject to the audit and accounting procedures established under its rules. In addition, all receipts and disbursements of funds handled by the commission shall be audited yearly by a certified public accountant and the report of the audit shall be included in and become part of the annual report of the commission.\n\n(b) The accounts of the commission shall be open at any reasonable time for inspection by duly constituted officers of the participating states and by any persons authorized by the commission.\n\n(c) Nothing contained in this article shall be construed to prevent compliance by the commission with laws relating to audit or inspection of accounts by or on behalf of any participating state or of the United States.\n\nARTICLE VIII.\n\nENTRY INTO FORCE; ADDITIONAL MEMBERS AND WITHDRAWAL\n\nSec. 8.1. Entry into force; additional members. The compact shall enter into force effective when enacted into law by any three states of the group of states composed of Connecticut, Delaware, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont and Virginia, and when the consent of Congress has been obtained. This compact shall also be open to states which are contiguous to any of the named states and open to states which are contiguous to participating states.\n\nSec. 8.2. Withdrawal from compact. Any participating state may withdraw from this compact by enacting a statute repealing the same, but no such withdrawal shall take effect until one year after notice in writing of the withdrawal is given to the commission and the governors of all other participating states. No withdrawal shall affect any liability already incurred by or chargeable to a party state prior to the time of such withdrawal.\n\nSec. 8.3. Severability. If any part or provision of this compact is adjudged invalid by any court, such judgment shall be confined in its operation to the part or provision directly involved in the controversy in which such judgment shall have been rendered and shall not affect or impair the validity of the remainder of this compact."

              "The production, sale and distribution of milk and certain milk products in this state are attended with serious conditions and practices affecting producers, dealers and consumers of milk; and, after due investigation of such conditions and practices, the following legislative findings of fact with respect thereto are hereby made.",
              "(1) Milk is the most necessary human food, vital for promotion of the public health; the health and growth of children are particularly dependent upon a constant and wholesome supply thereof. Since milk is a most fertile field for the growth of bacteria, its production and distribution have been surrounded by more costly sanitary requirements than those of any other food.",
              "(2) Milk consumers are not assured of a constant and sufficient supply of pure, wholesome milk when the high cost of maintaining sanitary conditions of production and high standards of purity is not returned to the producers of milk; or when a disparity between prices of milk and milk products and other commodities and services compels large numbers of producers to dispose of their herds or impairs the ability of producers to maintain such conditions and standards. Therefore, public health is menaced when milk dealers do not or cannot pay a price to producers commensurate with the cost of sanitary conditions of production and high standards of purity.",
              "(3) Milk dealers are required constantly to handle surpluses to meet the emergency requirements of unpredictable variations in fluid consumption and to meet seasonal variations in production, which milk in excess of fluid requirements must find an immediate market and tends to cause unfair, unreasonable and demoralizing trade and price practices, detrimental to the public health and interest. This excess milk is normally diverted into other uses at lower prices. Hence, producers who sell to a particular dealer or on a particular market should receive a proportionate share of the proceeds from the sale of milk in fluid form and in the lower price outlets if stable market conditions and equitable treatment of producers are to be assured.",
              "(4) Milk producers are required to make delivery of this highly perishable commodity immediately after it is produced and therefore must often accept any market at any price. Because of facts above stated, the value of milk cannot be determined until the dealer has sold such milk in fluid form or has disposed of it in surplus outlets; furthermore, only the dealers have convenient facilities for accurately weighing and testing milk. Hence, prior and often exclusive knowledge of the value of milk is in the possession of the dealer. The producers' lack of control over their market is aggravated by the trade custom of dealers in paying weeks after delivery, which often keeps producers obligated to continue delivery in order to receive payment for previous sales and permits dealers to operate on the producers' capital without giving security therefor. Hence, milk producers are subject to fraud and imposition, and do not possess the freedom of contract necessary for the procuring of cost of sanitary production. The above and attendant conditions and practices pertain to and exist in a paramount industry upon which the health and welfare of the inhabitants of the state are largely dependent; and the public interest therefore requires efficiency, equitable conditions, and the reduction or prevention of unhealthful, uneconomic, deceptive and destructive trade and price practices with respect thereto among producers, dealers and consumers. In exercise of the state police power to protect and promote the public health and welfare and to prevent fraud and imposition upon producers, such conditions and practices require control and regulation of the production, transportation, manufacture, processing, storage, distribution, sale and handling of milk as a business affecting the public health and interest."

For the purpose of this section, a person shall be deemed to be engaged in business who slaughters any such animal for sale or trade.\n\n(b) The following shall be deemed to be approved methods: (1) Rendering the animal insensible to pain by gunshot or mechanical, electrical, chemical or other rapid and effective means approved by the Commissioner of Consumer Protection or by the Secretary of Agriculture of the United States pursuant to the federal Humane Slaughter Act of 1958 (An Act of Congress approved August 27, 1958, Public Law 85-765, 72 Stat. 862, 7 USC 1901-1906), as amended; (2) restraint of the animal by means of a pen approved by the commissioner which firmly encloses the animal and, with a minimum of excitement and discomfort, places the animal in such a position that a cutting stroke may be administered quickly and efficiently; (3) restraint of the animal by means of a body harness approved by the commissioner which lifts, supports and cradles the animal and, with a minimum of excitement and discomfort, places it in such a position that a cutting stroke may be administered quickly and efficiently, and (4) restraint of the animal by any other means approved by the commissioner which causes the animal no unreasonable or unnecessary pain and which, with a minimum of excitement and discomfort, places the animal in such a position that a cutting stroke may be administered quickly and efficiently.\n\n(c) Use of a manually-operated sledge, hammer or poleax to render an animal insensible to pain is prohibited.\n\n(d) Any person who violates the provisions of this section shall be guilty of a class C misdemeanor. The commissioner, or any meat inspector acting under his direction, may seize any animal slaughtered in violation of the provisions of this section and the commissioner may, at his discretion, sell or otherwise dispose of the same.

              "(a) As used in this section, “livestock animal” means any camelid or hooved animal raised for domestic or commercial use. The Commissioner of Agriculture shall supervise commission sales stables where livestock animals are sold at public auctions. Any person, firm or corporation engaged in the business of selling livestock animals at such auctions or sales shall annually apply to said commissioner for a license upon a form to be prescribed by the commissioner. The fee for each such license shall be one hundred ninety dollars, payable to said commissioner. Each such license shall be issued for the period of one year from July first and may be revoked for cause. If, in the judgment of the commissioner, any provision of this section has been violated, the commissioner shall send notice by registered or certified mail to the licensee, who shall be given a hearing, and, if violation is proven, the license shall be revoked. If a license to deal in livestock, issued to any person, firm or corporation by another state, has been suspended or revoked by such state within five years next preceding the date of issuance or renewal of a license to such person, firm or corporation under the provisions of this section, such suspension or revocation shall constitute just cause for revocation under this section. All dairy animals to be sold at such auction shall be segregated from beef animals prior to such sales. The sale of dairy animals shall precede the sale of those assigned for slaughter. All bovines more than three hundred pounds in weight, except dairy and breeding animals, that are delivered to a sale shall be branded with the letter “S” in a conspicuous place or identified in a manner acceptable to the commissioner or the commissioner's designee by the operator of the sale or the operator's representative. All dairy and breeding animals from within the state arriving at a sale shall be from a herd that: (1) Is under state supervision for the control of brucellosis and tuberculosis and that has been tested for brucellosis and tuberculosis less than fourteen months before the sale, (2) has been tested for tuberculosis less than fourteen months before the sale and is regularly tested under the brucellosis ring test program of the Department of Agriculture, or (3) is certified to be brucellosis-free under the program established pursuant to section 22-299a . All dairy and breeding animals which are not cosigned for immediate slaughter, arriving at a sale from outside the state shall comply with chapter 433 and be accompanied by a health certificate issued by the livestock official of the state of their origin and by an import permit from the commissioner or, alternatively, such dairy or breeding animals shall be examined by a licensed accredited veterinarian who shall issue an interstate health certificate for such animal at the expense of the licensee. All animals offered for dairy or breeding purposes shall be identified by an official ear tag, or by a breed registration number if accompanied by the corresponding breed registration certificate. Animals consigned for slaughter shall be sold only to owners or agents of slaughtering establishments and moved directly to such slaughtering establishments for immediate slaughter or slaughter that occurs not later than seventy-two hours after the time of sale. All stables and sales rings shall be kept clean and shall be suitably disinfected prior to each sale. The provisions of this section shall not apply to the sale of an individual herd at an auction conducted by the owner thereof. Any person, or any officer or agent of any corporation, who violates any provision of this section or who obstructs or attempts to obstruct the Commissioner of Agriculture or the commissioner's deputy or assistants in the performance of their duty, shall be guilty of a class D misdemeanor.",

The amount of each such bond shall be based on the amount of one average sale of such person, firm or corporation. One average sale shall be computed by dividing the total yearly gross receipts from the sale of all livestock during the preceding twelve months by the number of sales during such time, provided the number of sales used to compute one average sale shall not be greater than one hundred thirty. If the amount of one average sale is ten thousand dollars or less the amount of the bond shall be ten thousand dollars. If the amount of one average sale is more than ten thousand dollars but not more than twenty-six thousand dollars, the amount of the bond shall be not less than the next multiple of two thousand dollars above such amount. If the amount of one average sale is more than twenty-six thousand dollars but not more than thirty thousand dollars, the amount of such bond shall be thirty thousand dollars. If the amount of one average sale is more than thirty thousand dollars, the amount of the bond shall be not less than the next multiple of five thousand dollars above such amount.",
              "(c) Any person, firm or corporation licensed pursuant to subsection (a) of this section shall maintain accurate records of the name and address of the seller and buyer of livestock, the name of the livestock dealer, broker or transporter and any other party involved in each transaction, the official identification for each animal, and the destination or other disposition for each animal entering the premises of the commission sales stables. Such records shall be maintained at the commission sales stable for a period of three years from the date of sale. Such records or copies of such records shall be made available to the commissioner, or the commissioner's designated representative for inspection not later than twenty-four hours after notice to the licensee of such request. Any person who: (1) Fails to provide the requested documentation to the commissioner, or the commissioner's designated representative; (2) obstructs the commissioner or the commissioner's designated representative in the performance of the department's duties pursuant to this section; or (3) intentionally provides false or misleading information to the commissioner or the commissioner's designated representative, shall be fined not more than one hundred dollars per day until the requested, accurate and complete information is provided to the commissioner or the commissioner's designated representative.",

When a certificate has been filed with the commissioner that such animal has been euthanized and the premises disinfected according to the order of the commissioner, within a period of time specified by the commissioner, following the issuance of such order, the amount determined under this section shall be paid to the owner by the state. No animal, the physical condition of which is such that it is of no real value, and no animal which has been in the state for a period of less than three months next preceding its quarantine shall be paid for by the state unless such animal was a natural addition to the herd that was born in this state or was imported into this state in compliance with this chapter.\n\n(b) The amount paid by the state for any livestock that is condemned pursuant to this section and sold for slaughter, shall be deposited by the commissioner into the General Fund. The amount paid by the state to the owner of any such animal shall be limited to the difference between the fair market value of such animal, established pursuant to subsection (a) of this section, and the amount of any indemnity or payment for such animal received by the owner from the federal government. No compensation shall be paid to the owner of any such livestock by the state unless such animal has been destroyed to prevent the spread of an infectious or contagious disease or to protect the public health. Any animal that is condemned shall be identified with a tag, brand device or marking approved by the commissioner. No such animal shall be moved, euthanized, sold or used for food, except under the direction of the commissioner.\n\n(c) Any person aggrieved by an order of the commissioner to condemn livestock pursuant to this section may appeal such order to the superior court for the judicial district of Hartford not later than seven days after issuance of such order."

The amount of the bond to be returned to the owner shall be calculated at the rate of twenty dollars per day per animal or thirty dollars per day per animal if the animal is a horse or other large livestock for the number of days less than thirty that such agency or person has not had temporary care and custody of the animal less any veterinary costs and expenses incurred for the welfare of the animal.\n\n(5) If the court makes a finding under subdivision (3) of this subsection after the issuance of an order of temporary care and custody and the owner of the animal has posted a bond, the agency or person with whom the bond was posted shall return such bond to such owner.\n\n(h) If the court finds that the animal is neglected or cruelly treated, the expenses incurred by the state or a municipality in providing proper food, shelter and care to an animal it has taken custody of under subsection (a) or (b) of this section and the expenses incurred by any state, municipal or other public or private agency or person in providing temporary care and custody pursuant to an order vesting temporary care and custody, calculated at the rate of twenty dollars per day per animal or thirty dollars per day per animal if the animal is a horse or other large livestock until the date ownership is vested pursuant to subdivision (1) of subsection (g) of this section shall be paid by the owner or owners or person having responsibility for the care of the animal. In addition, all veterinary costs and expenses incurred for the welfare of the animal shall be paid by the owner or owners or person having responsibility for the animal.\n\n(i) If the court vests ownership of the animal in the Commissioner of Agriculture or a municipality, the commissioner or the municipality may conduct or participate in a public auction of the animal under such conditions the commissioner or the municipality deems necessary or the commissioner or the municipality may consign the animal to an auction or sell the animal through an open advertised bid process whereby bid price and demonstration of sufficient knowledge and ability to care for such animal are factors for the commissioner's or municipality's consideration. All moneys collected from the sale of animals sold by the Commissioner of Agriculture through such open advertised bid process shall be deposited in the animal abuse cost recovery account established in subsection (j) of this section. All moneys collected from the sale of animals sold by a municipality through such open advertised bid process shall be deposited by the town treasurer or other fiscal officer in the town's general fund. The commissioner or the municipality may also vest ownership of any such animal in an individual or a public or private nonprofit animal rescue or adoption organization. Any record containing the name, address or other personally identifying information of the new owner of such animal shall be exempt from disclosure under state law, provided such information may be disclosed pursuant to the issuance of a lawful subpoena.\n\n(j) There is established a separate, nonlapsing account within the General Fund, to be known as the “animal abuse cost recovery account”. All moneys collected from sales at public auction of animals seized by the Department of Agriculture pursuant to this section shall be deposited into the account. Deposits of moneys may be made into the account from public or private sources, including, but not limited to, the federal government or municipal governments.\n\n(k) Notwithstanding any provision of the general statutes, any moneys received by the Department of Agriculture pursuant to subsection (j) of this section shall be deposited in the General Fund and credited to the animal abuse cost recovery account. The account shall be available to the Commissioner of Agriculture for the purpose of the housing, care and welfare of any animal seized by the department, until final disposition of such animal. Additionally, the account may be used for the purpose of providing reimbursement to any municipality for the costs of providing temporary care to such animal if such temporary care exceeded thirty days in duration and such costs exceeded the amount of any surety bond or cash bond posted pursuant to subsection (f) of this section provided the total annual reimbursement to municipalities from said account for such purpose shall not exceed twenty-five thousand dollars. Nothing in this section shall prevent the commissioner from obtaining or using funds from sources other than the account for the housing, care and welfare of any animal seized by the department pursuant to this section.\n\nSee Sec. 54-86n re appointment of advocate in proceeding re the welfare or custody of a cat or dog."

Any such officer may take into custody (1) any dog found roaming in violation of the provisions of section 22-364 , (2) any dog not having a tag or plate on a collar about its neck or on a harness on its body as provided by law or which is not confined or controlled in accordance with the provisions of any order or regulation relating to rabies issued by the commissioner in accordance with the provisions of this chapter, or (3) any dog or other domestic animal found injured on any highway, neglected, abandoned or cruelly treated. The officer shall impound such dog or other domestic animal at the pound serving the town where the dog or other domestic animal is taken unless, in the opinion of a licensed veterinarian, the dog or other domestic animal is so injured or diseased that it should be euthanized immediately, in which case the municipal animal control officer of such town may have such dog or other animal humanely euthanized by a licensed veterinarian or disposed of as the State Veterinarian may direct. The officer shall immediately notify the owner or keeper of any dog or other animal so taken, if known, of its impoundment. If the owner or keeper of any such dog or other domestic animal is unknown, the officer shall immediately tag or employ other suitable means of official identification of the dog or other domestic animal and shall promptly cause (A) a description of such dog or other domestic animal to be published once in the lost and found column of a newspaper having a circulation in such town or that has a state-wide circulation, and (B) a photograph or description of such dog or other domestic animal and the date on which such dog or other domestic animal is no longer legally required to be impounded to be posted on a national pet adoption Internet web site or an Internet web site that is maintained or accessed by the animal control officer and that is accessible to the public through an Internet search, except such posting shall not be required if: (i) The dog or other domestic animal is held pending the resolution of civil or criminal litigation involving such dog or other domestic animal, (ii) the officer has a good faith belief that the dog or other domestic animal would be adopted by or transferred to a public or private nonprofit rescue organization for the purpose of placing such dog or other domestic animal in an adoptive home even in the absence of such posting, (iii) the dog or other domestic animal's safety will be placed at risk, or (iv) such animal control officer determines that such dog or other domestic animal is feral and not adoptable. If any animal control officer does not have the technological resources to post such information on an Internet web site as required by subparagraph (B) of this subdivision, such officer may contact a public or private animal rescue organization and request that such organization post such information, at such organization's expense, on an Internet web site that is accessible to the public through an Internet search. To the extent practicable, any such posting by an animal control officer or a public or private animal rescue organization shall remain posted for the duration of such dog's or other domestic animal's impoundment in the municipal or regional dog pound.\n\n(b) If such dog or other domestic animal is not claimed by and released to the owner within seven days after the date of publication, such officer, upon finding such dog or other domestic animal to be in satisfactory health, may have a licensed veterinarian spay or neuter such dog and sell such dog or other domestic animal to any person who satisfies such officer that such person is purchasing such dog or other domestic animal as a pet and that such person can give it a good home and proper care. Such officer may retain possession of such dog or other domestic animal for such additional period of time as such officer may deem advisable in order to place such dog or other domestic animal as a pet and may have a licensed veterinarian spay or neuter such dog. If, within such period, any dog or other domestic animal is not claimed by and released to the owner or keeper or purchased as a pet, the officer shall cause such dog or other domestic animal to be humanely euthanized by a licensed veterinarian or disposed of as the State Veterinarian may direct. Any veterinarian who so euthanizes a dog shall be paid from the dog fund account. No person who euthanizes a dog or other domestic animal shall be held criminally or civilly liable therefor nor shall any licensed veterinarian who spays or neuters a dog pursuant to this section be held civilly liable.\n\n(c) The town treasurer or other fiscal officer shall pay from the dog fund account the advertising expense incurred under the provisions of this section upon receipt of an itemized statement together with a copy of the advertisement as published. Any person who purchases a dog as a pet shall pay a fee of five dollars and procure a license and tag for such dog from the town clerk, in accordance with the provisions of section 22-338 . In addition to the five-dollar fee, any person who purchases a dog as a pet may be charged the cost the municipality incurred, if any, to spay or neuter and vaccinate the dog, provided such charge shall not exceed one hundred fifty dollars.\n\n(d) No regional or municipal dog pound facility, municipality, animal control officer or regional animal control officer appointed pursuant to section 22-328 , 22-331 , or 22-331a , as applicable, or public or private nonprofit animal rescue organization that arranges for the provision of treatment by a licensed veterinarian to an injured, sick or diseased animal pursuant to a contract described in section 22-332e shall be held civilly liable for such actions unless such actions are performed in a wanton, reckless or malicious manner. No licensed veterinarian who provides treatment free of charge or for a reduced fee, to an injured, sick or diseased animal as a direct result of a contract described in section 22-332e shall be held civilly liable for the provision of such treatment unless such actions are performed in a wilful, wanton or reckless manner."

The veterinarian performing the euthanasia shall be responsible for ensuring that the head of the euthanized animal is delivered to the appropriate laboratory for rabies examination not later than forty-eight hours after such euthanasia. The costs of any such quarantine, veterinary examination, rabies vaccination, euthanasia and rabies testing shall be the responsibility of the owner or keeper of any animal quarantined or confined pursuant to this section.\n\n(f) Any dog, cat or other animal held in quarantine that is clinically diagnosed as rabid by a licensed veterinarian or the State Veterinarian shall be humanely euthanized immediately without prior notice to the owner or keeper of same.

Any animal that is humanely euthanized pursuant to this subsection shall be examined for rabies by the Connecticut Department of Public Health Laboratory or any laboratory authorized by the Connecticut Department of Public Health. The veterinarian performing the euthanasia shall be responsible for ensuring that the head of the euthanized animal is delivered to the appropriate laboratory for rabies examination not later than forty-eight hours after being euthanized.\n\n(g) Any animal, other than a dog, that is quarantined pursuant to this section which is not claimed by its owner or keeper not later than five days after the expiration of such quarantine may be sold or given away by the municipal or regional animal control officer provided the animal is in good health. The animal may only be sold or given away as a pet to a person who satisfies such officer that the animal will be given a good home and proper care. The municipal animal control officer may retain possession of such animal for such additional period of time as necessary to place such animal. Any animal, other than a dog, that is quarantined pursuant to this section and that is not claimed by its owner or keeper not later than five days after the expiration of such quarantine and that is not sold by the municipal or regional animal control officer not later than five days after the expiration of such quarantine, may be disposed of at the direction of the State Veterinarian.

For purposes of this section, “wild animal” means any mammal which is ferae naturae or wild by nature.\n\n(i) The commissioner shall institute such measures as the commissioner deems necessary to prevent the transmission of rabies associated with animals in public settings, including, but not limited to, fairs, shows, exhibitions, petting zoos, riding stables, farm tours, pet shops and educational exhibits.\n\n(j) The commissioner shall adopt regulations, in accordance with chapter 54, to implement the provisions of subsection (i) of this section.

Such regulations may consider the species of animal, the characteristics of the public settings and the nature and type of contact the public may have with animals.\n\n(k) Any suspected or confirmed case of rabies shall be reported to the State Veterinarian by the testing diagnostic laboratory or a local director of health or any licensed veterinarian not later than twenty-four hours after receipt of such information.\n\n(l) Any person who fails to comply with any order issued pursuant to this section shall be fined two hundred fifty dollars. Any dog, cat or other animal subject to a quarantine or confinement order issued pursuant to this section whose owner or keeper fails to comply with such quarantine order may be seized by any state, municipal or regional animal control officer and held in quarantine until such quarantine is complete and the dog, cat or other animal is examined by a licensed veterinarian. All costs associated with a failure to comply with a quarantine or confinement order issued pursuant to this section, including, but not limited to, the costs of seizure, care, handling, veterinary examination and rabies vaccination shall be paid by the owner or keeper of such animal prior to the release of such animal to such owner or keeper."
