The authority, or any director thereof, in the performance of its duties or in connection with any hearing, or at the request of any person, corporation, company, town, borough or association, may summon and examine, under oath, such witnesses, and may direct the production of, and examine or cause to be produced and examined, such books, records, vouchers, memoranda, documents, letters, contracts or other papers in relation to the affairs of any public service company or person involved in the transportation of gas, as such terms are defined in section 16-280a , as it may find advisable, and shall have the same powers in reference thereto as are vested in magistrates taking depositions. If any witness objects to testifying or to producing any book or paper on the ground that such testimony, book or paper may tend to incriminate him, and the authority directs such witness to testify or to produce such book or paper, and he complies, or if he is compelled so to do by order of court, he shall not be prosecuted for any matter concerning which he or she has so testified. The fees of witnesses summoned by the authority to appear before it under the provisions of this section, and the fees for summoning witnesses shall be the same as in the Superior Court. All such fees, together with any other expenses authorized by statute, the method of payment of which is not otherwise provided, shall, when taxed by the authority, be paid by the state, through the business office of the authority, in the same manner as court expenses. The authority may designate in specific cases a hearing officer who may be a member of its technical staff or a member of the Connecticut Bar engaged for that purpose under a contract approved by the Secretary of the Office of Policy and Management to hold a hearing and make report thereon to the authority. A hearing officer so designated shall have the same powers as the authority, or any director thereof, to conduct a hearing, except that only a director of the authority shall have the power to grant immunity from prosecution to any witness who objects to testifying or to producing any book or paper on the ground that such testimony, book or paper may tend to incriminate him or her.",
              "(b) (1) The authority may employ professional personnel to perform management audits. The authority shall promptly establish such procedures as it deems necessary or desirable to provide for management audits to be performed on a regular or irregular schedule on all or any portion of the operating procedures and any other internal workings of any public service company or person involved in the transportation of gas, as such terms are defined in section 16-280a , including the relationship between any public service company or person involved in the transportation of gas, as such terms are defined in section 16-280a , and a related holding company or subsidiary, consistent with the provisions of section 16-8c , provided no such audit shall be performed on a community antenna television company, except with regard to any noncable communications services which the company may provide, or when (A) such an audit is necessary for the authority to perform its regulatory functions under the Communications Act of 1934, 47 USC 151, et seq., as amended from time to time, other federal law or state law, (B) the cost of such an audit is warranted by a reasonably foreseeable financial, safety or service benefit to subscribers of the company which is the subject of such an audit, and (C) such an audit is restricted to examination of the operating procedures that affect operations within the state.",
              "(2) In any case where the authority determines that an audit is necessary or desirable, it may (A) order the audit to be performed by one of the management audit teams, (B) require the affected company or person to perform the audit utilizing the company's own internal management audit staff as supervised by designated members of the authority's staff or the person's own internal management audit staff as supervised by designated members of the authority's staff, or (C) require that the audit be performed under the supervision of designated members of the authority's staff by an independent management consulting firm selected by the authority, in consultation with the affected company or person.

All audits performed pursuant to this section shall be performed in accordance with generally accepted management audit standards. The authority shall adopt regulations in accordance with the provisions of chapter 54 setting forth such generally accepted management audit standards. Each audit of a community antenna television company shall be consistent with the provisions of the Communications Act of 1934, 47 USC 151, et seq., as amended from time to time, and of any other applicable federal law. The authority shall certify whether a portion of an audit conforms to the provisions of this section and constitutes a portion of a complete audit.",
              "(4) A complete audit of each portion of each gas company, electric distribution company or water company having more than seventy-five thousand customers shall begin no less frequently than every six years, so that a complete audit of such a company's operations shall be performed every six years. Such an audit of each such company having more than seventy-five thousand customers shall be updated as required by the authority.",

Any costs or expenses, as determined by the authority, incurred by the company or person to address or remediate an inefficient, improvident, unreasonable, negligent or imprudent management or company practice identified in the course of the management audit shall not constitute prudent, reasonable and proper costs and expenses.",
              "(7) After notice and hearing, the authority may modify the scope and schedule of a management audit of a telephone company which is subject to an alternative form of regulation so that such audit is consistent with that alternative form of regulation.",

In its performance of duties pursuant to this subsection, the authority and the Office of Consumer Counsel may retain consultants to provide training in areas in which staff expertise does not currently exist or when necessary to supplement existing staff expertise, and may incur other reasonable costs related to stakeholder engagement and the program, provided the total costs incurred by the authority and the Office of Consumer Counsel under this subsection do not exceed one million dollars per year.\n\n(d) Any application submitted pursuant to this section shall include:\n\n(1) A statement of the nature and extent and the factual and legal basis of the stakeholder's planned participation, to the extent it is possible to describe such participation with reasonable specificity at the time the application is filed.\n\n(2) A detailed budget of anticipated attorneys' and expert witness fees and other costs of preparation for and participation in the proceeding.\n\n(3) If participation will impose a significant financial hardship and the stakeholder group seeks advance payment of an award of compensation in order to initiate, continue or complete participation in the proceeding, the stakeholder group shall include substantial evidence of significant financial hardship in its application.\n\n(4) Any other requirements, as determined by the authority.\n\n(e) (1) Not later than thirty days after receiving a stakeholder group's application, the authority shall decide if the stakeholder group's participation constitutes a substantial contribution. If the authority finds that such participation is a substantial contribution, the authority shall describe this substantial contribution and determine if the stakeholder group has significant financial hardship pursuant to subdivision (2) of this subsection.\n\n(2) Notwithstanding subsection (f) of this section, if the authority finds that the stakeholder group has significant financial hardship, the authority may direct the public service company or companies subject to the proceeding to pay all or part of the expected compensation, as determined by the authority, to the stakeholder group before the end of the proceeding. If the stakeholder group discontinues its participation in the proceeding without the consent of the authority, the authority shall recover all or part of any payments made to such stakeholder and refund such payments to the public service company or companies that made the payments.\n\n(3) Any determination by the authority to direct payment of all or part of a stakeholder group's expected compensation before the end of a proceeding pursuant to subdivision (2) of this subsection shall take into consideration the compensation paid to attorneys, expert witnesses and other persons of comparable training and experience who offer similar services as the services relevant to the stakeholder group's application and compensation.\n\n(4) Each stakeholder group shall return any unused compensation to the authority, which the authority shall refund to the public service company or companies that provided the compensation.\n\n(5) The authority shall require that every stakeholder group maintain an itemized record of all expenditures incurred as a result of the proceeding. The authority may use the record to verify the stakeholder group's claim of financial hardship and to determine if any unused funds remain at the completion of a proceeding.\n\n(6) If the authority determines that two or more stakeholder groups have substantially similar interests, the authority may require such stakeholder groups to apply jointly in order to receive compensation.\n\n(f) Any compensation shall be paid at the conclusion of the proceeding by the public service company, in a manner determined by the authority. Compensation shall be paid by all relevant public service companies in proportion to such companies' relative annual load, number of customers or revenue, as determined by the authority.\n\n(g) The authority shall not award compensation to any stakeholder group that delays or obstructs, or attempts to delay or obstruct, the orderly and timely fulfillment of the authority's duties under this title.\n\n(h) Nothing in this section shall be construed as restricting, diminishing or otherwise altering the provisions of section 16-2a concerning the Office of Consumer Counsel."

              "(a) No public service company may charge rates in excess of those previously approved by the Public Utilities Control Authority or the Public Utilities Regulatory Authority, except that any rate approved by the Public Utilities Commission, the Public Utilities Control Authority or the Public Utilities Regulatory Authority shall be permitted until amended by the Public Utilities Regulatory Authority, that rates not approved by the Public Utilities Regulatory Authority may be charged pursuant to subsection (b) of this section, and that the hearing requirements with respect to adjustment clauses are as set forth in section 16-19b . For water companies, existing rates shall include the amount of any adjustments approved pursuant to section 16-262w since the company's most recent general rate case, provided any adjustment amount shall be separately identified in any customer bill. Each public service company shall file any proposed amendment of its existing rates with the authority in such form and in accordance with such reasonable regulations as the authority may prescribe. Each electric distribution, gas or telephone company filing a proposed amendment shall also file with the authority an estimate of the effects of the amendment, for various levels of consumption, on the household budgets of high and moderate income customers and customers having household incomes not more than one hundred fifty per cent of the federal poverty level. Each electric distribution company shall also file such an estimate for space heating customers. Each water company, except a water company that provides water to its customers less than six consecutive months in a calendar year, filing a proposed amendment, shall also file with the authority a plan for promoting water conservation by customers in such form and in accordance with a memorandum of understanding entered into by the authority pursuant to section 4-67e . Each public service company shall notify each customer who would be affected by the proposed amendment, by mail, at least one week prior to the first public hearing thereon, but not earlier than six weeks prior to such first public hearing, that an amendment has been or will be requested. Such notice shall also indicate (1) the date, time and location of any scheduled public hearing, (2) a statement that customers may provide written comments regarding the proposed amendment to the Public Utilities Regulatory Authority or appear in person at any scheduled public hearing, (3) the Public Utilities Regulatory Authority telephone number for obtaining information concerning the schedule for public hearings on the proposed amendment, and (4) whether the proposed amendment would, in the company's best estimate, increase any rate or charge by five per cent or more, and, if so, describe in general terms any such rate or charge and the amount of the proposed increase. If a company fails to provide adequate notice, the authority shall consider the effective filing date of such company's proposed amendment to be the date that the company provides adequate notice to customers, as determined by the authority. Until the effective filing date, no days shall count toward the time limit for a final decision in this subsection. In the case of a proposed amendment to the rates of any public service company, the authority shall hold one or more public hearings thereon, except as permitted with respect to interim rate amendments by subsections (d) and (g) of this section, and shall make such investigation of such proposed amendment of rates as is necessary to determine whether such rates conform to the principles and guidelines set forth in section 16-19e , or are unreasonably discriminatory or more or less than just, reasonable and adequate, or that the service furnished by such company is inadequate to or in excess of public necessity and convenience, provided the authority may (A) evaluate the reasonableness and adequacy of the performance or service of the public service company using any applicable metrics or standards adopted by the authority pursuant to section 16-244aa , and (B) determine the reasonableness of the allowed rate of return of the public service company based on such performance evaluation. The authority, if in its opinion such action appears necessary or suitable in the public interest may, and, upon written petition or complaint of the state, under direction of the Governor, shall, make the aforesaid investigation of any such proposed amendment which does not involve an alteration in rates. If the authority finds any proposed amendment of rates to not conform to the principles and guidelines set forth in section 16-19e , or to be unreasonably discriminatory or more or less than just, reasonable and adequate to enable such company to provide properly for the public convenience, necessity and welfare, or the service to be inadequate or excessive, it shall determine and prescribe, as appropriate, an adequate service to be furnished or just and reasonable maximum rates and charges to be made by such company. In the case of a proposed amendment filed by an electric distribution, gas or telephone company, the authority shall also adjust the estimate filed under this subsection of the effects of the amendment on the household budgets of the company's customers, in accordance with the rates and charges approved by the authority. The authority shall issue a final decision on each electric distribution or gas company rate filing not later than three hundred fifty days after the effective filing date of the proposed amendment. The authority shall issue a final decision on all public service company rate filings, except electric distribution or gas company rate filings, not later than two hundred seventy days after the effective filing date of the proposed amendment.",
              "(b) If the authority has not made its finding respecting an amendment of any electric distribution or gas company rate within three hundred fifty days from the proposed effective date of such amendment thereof, or if the authority has not made its finding respecting an amendment of any public service company rate, except an electric distribution or a gas company rate, within two hundred seventy days from the proposed effective date of such amendment thereof, such amendment may become effective pending the authority's finding with respect to such amendment upon the filing by the company with the authority of assurance satisfactory to the authority, which may include a bond with surety, of the company's ability and willingness to refund to its customers with interest such amounts as the company may collect from them in excess of the rates fixed by the authority in its finding or fixed at the conclusion of any appeal taken as a result of a finding by the authority.",
              "(c) Upon conclusion of its investigation of the reasonableness of any proposed increase of rates, the authority shall order the company to refund to its customers with interest any amounts the company may have collected from them during the period that any amendment permitted by subsection (b) of this section was in force, which amounts the authority may find to have been in excess of the rates fixed by the authority in its finding or fixed at the conclusion of any appeal taken as a result of a finding by the authority. Any such refund ordered by the authority shall be paid by the company, under direction of the authority, to its customers in such amounts as are determined by the authority.",
              "(d) Nothing in this section shall be construed to prevent the authority from approving an interim rate increase, if the authority finds that such an interim rate increase is necessary to prevent substantial and material deterioration of the financial condition of a public service company, to prevent substantial deterioration of the adequacy and reliability of service to its customers or to conform to the applicable principles and guidelines set forth in section 16-19e , provided the authority shall first hold a special public hearing on the need for such interim rate increase and the company, at least one week prior to such hearing, notifies each customer who would be affected by the interim rate increase that such an increase is being requested. The company shall include the notice in a mailing of customer bills, unless such a mailing would not provide timely notice, in which case the authority shall authorize an alternative manner of providing such notice. Any such interim rate increase shall only be permitted if the public service company submits an assurance satisfactory to the authority, which may include a bond with surety, of the company's ability and willingness to refund to its customers with interest such amounts as the company may collect from such interim rates in excess of the rates approved by the authority in accordance with subsection (a) of this section. The authority shall order a refund in an amount equal to the excess, if any, of the amount collected pursuant to the interim rates over the amount which would have been collected pursuant to the rates finally approved by the authority in accordance with subsection (a) of this section or fixed at the conclusion of any appeal taken as a result of any finding by the authority. Such refund ordered by the authority shall be paid by the company to its customers in such amounts and by such procedure as ordered by the authority.",
              "(e) If the authority finds that the imposition of any increase in rates would create a hardship for a municipality, because such increase is not reflected in its then current budget, or cannot be included in the budget of its fiscal year which begins less than five months after the effective date of such increase, the authority may defer the applicability of such increase with respect to services furnished to such municipality until the fiscal year of such municipality beginning not less than five months following the effective date of such increase; provided the revenues lost to the public service company through such deferral shall be paid to the public service company by the municipality in its first fiscal year following the period of such deferral.",
              "(f) Any public service company, as defined in section 16-1 , filing an application with the Public Utilities Regulatory Authority to reopen a rate proceeding under this section, which application proposes to increase the company's revenues or any rate or charge of the company by five per cent or more, shall, not later than one week prior to the hearing under the reopened proceeding, notify each customer who would be affected thereby that such an application is being filed. Such notice shall indicate the rate increases proposed in the application. The company shall include the notice in a mailing of customer bills, unless such a mailing would not provide timely notice to customers of the reopening of the proceeding, in which case the authority shall authorize an alternative manner of providing such notice. The authority shall only grant an application by a public service company to reopen a rate proceeding under this section upon a unanimous vote of the utility commissioners.",
              "(g) The authority shall hold either a special public hearing or combine an investigation with an ongoing four-year review conducted in accordance with section 16-19a or with a general rate hearing conducted in accordance with subsection (a) of this section on the need for an interim rate decrease (1) when a public service company has, for the rolling twelve-month period ending with the two most recent consecutive financial quarters, earned a return on equity which exceeds the return authorized by the authority by at least one-half of one percentage point, (2) if it finds that any change in municipal, state or federal tax law creates a significant increase in a company's rate of return, or (3) if it provides appropriate notice that a public service company may be collecting rates or may have an authorized rate of return which is or are more than just, reasonable and adequate, as determined by the authority, provided the authority shall require appropriate notice of hearing to the company and its customers who would be affected by an interim rate decrease in such form as the authority deems reasonable. The company shall be required to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the authority that earning such a return on equity, having an authorized rate of return or collecting rates which are more than just, reasonable and adequate is directly beneficial to its customers. At the completion of the proceeding, the authority may order an interim rate decrease if it finds that such return on equity or rates exceeds a reasonable rate of return or is more than just, reasonable and adequate as determined by the authority. Any such interim rate decrease shall be subject to a customer surcharge if the interim rates collected by the company are less than the rates finally approved by the authority or fixed at the conclusion of any appeal taken as a result of any finding by the authority. Such surcharge shall be assessed against customers in such amounts and by such procedure as ordered by the authority.",
              "(h) The provisions of this section shall not apply to the regulation of a telecommunications service which is a competitive service, as defined in section 16-247a , or to a telecommunications service to which an approved plan for an alternative form of regulation applies, pursuant to section 16-247k .",

For water companies, existing rates shall include the amount of any adjustments approved pursuant to section 16-262w since the company's most recent general rate case, provided any adjustment amount shall be separately identified in any customer bill. Each public service company shall file any proposed amendment of its existing rates with the authority in such form and in accordance with such reasonable regulations as the authority may prescribe. Each electric distribution, gas or telephone company filing a proposed amendment shall also file with the authority an estimate of the effects of the amendment, for various levels of consumption, on the household budgets of high and moderate income customers and customers having household incomes not more than one hundred fifty per cent of the federal poverty level. Each electric distribution company shall also file such an estimate for space heating customers. Each water company, except a water company that provides water to its customers less than six consecutive months in a calendar year, filing a proposed amendment, shall also file with the authority a plan for promoting water conservation by customers in such form and in accordance with a memorandum of understanding entered into by the authority pursuant to section 4-67e . Each public service company shall notify each customer who would be affected by the proposed amendment, by mail, at least one week prior to the first public hearing thereon, but not earlier than six weeks prior to such first public hearing, that an amendment has been or will be requested. Such notice shall also indicate (1) the date, time and location of any scheduled public hearing, (2) a statement that customers may provide written comments regarding the proposed amendment to the Public Utilities Regulatory Authority or appear in person at any scheduled public hearing, (3) the Public Utilities Regulatory Authority telephone number for obtaining information concerning the schedule for public hearings on the proposed amendment, and (4) whether the proposed amendment would, in the company's best estimate, increase any rate or charge by five per cent or more, and, if so, describe in general terms any such rate or charge and the amount of the proposed increase. If a company fails to provide adequate notice, the authority shall consider the effective filing date of such company's proposed amendment to be the date that the company provides adequate notice to customers, as determined by the authority. Until the effective filing date, no days shall count toward the time limit for a final decision in this subsection. In the case of a proposed amendment to the rates of any public service company, the authority shall hold one or more public hearings thereon, except as permitted with respect to interim rate amendments by subsections (d) and (g) of this section, and shall make such investigation of such proposed amendment of rates as is necessary to determine whether such rates conform to the principles and guidelines set forth in section 16-19e , or are unreasonably discriminatory or more or less than just, reasonable and adequate, or that the service furnished by such company is inadequate to or in excess of public necessity and convenience, provided the authority may (A) evaluate the reasonableness and adequacy of the performance or service of the public service company using any applicable metrics or standards adopted by the authority pursuant to section 16-244aa , and (B) determine the reasonableness of the allowed rate of return of the public service company based on such performance evaluation. The authority, if in its opinion such action appears necessary or suitable in the public interest may, and, upon written petition or complaint of the state, under direction of the Governor, shall, make the aforesaid investigation of any such proposed amendment which does not involve an alteration in rates. If the authority finds any proposed amendment of rates to not conform to the principles and guidelines set forth in section 16-19e , or to be unreasonably discriminatory or more or less than just, reasonable and adequate to enable such company to provide properly for the public convenience, necessity and welfare, or the service to be inadequate or excessive, it shall determine and prescribe, as appropriate, an adequate service to be furnished or just and reasonable maximum rates and charges to be made by such company. In the case of a proposed amendment filed by an electric distribution, gas or telephone company, the authority shall also adjust the estimate filed under this subsection of the effects of the amendment on the household budgets of the company's customers, in accordance with the rates and charges approved by the authority. The authority shall issue a final decision on each electric distribution or gas company rate filing not later than three hundred fifty days after the effective filing date of the proposed amendment. The authority shall issue a final decision on all public service company rate filings, except electric distribution or gas company rate filings, not later than two hundred seventy days after the effective filing date of the proposed amendment.\n\n(b) If the authority has not made its finding respecting an amendment of any electric distribution or gas company rate within three hundred fifty days from the proposed effective date of such amendment thereof, or if the authority has not made its finding respecting an amendment of any public service company rate, except an electric distribution or a gas company rate, within two hundred seventy days from the proposed effective date of such amendment thereof, such amendment may become effective pending the authority's finding with respect to such amendment upon the filing by the company with the authority of assurance satisfactory to the authority, which may include a bond with surety, of the company's ability and willingness to refund to its customers with interest such amounts as the company may collect from them in excess of the rates fixed by the authority in its finding or fixed at the conclusion of any appeal taken as a result of a finding by the authority.\n\n(c) Upon conclusion of its investigation of the reasonableness of any proposed increase of rates, the authority shall order the company to refund to its customers with interest any amounts the company may have collected from them during the period that any amendment permitted by subsection (b) of this section was in force, which amounts the authority may find to have been in excess of the rates fixed by the authority in its finding or fixed at the conclusion of any appeal taken as a result of a finding by the authority. Any such refund ordered by the authority shall be paid by the company, under direction of the authority, to its customers in such amounts as are determined by the authority.\n\n(d) Nothing in this section shall be construed to prevent the authority from approving an interim rate increase, if the authority finds that such an interim rate increase is necessary to prevent substantial and material deterioration of the financial condition of a public service company, to prevent substantial deterioration of the adequacy and reliability of service to its customers or to conform to the applicable principles and guidelines set forth in section 16-19e , provided the authority shall first hold a special public hearing on the need for such interim rate increase and the company, at least one week prior to such hearing, notifies each customer who would be affected by the interim rate increase that such an increase is being requested. The company shall include the notice in a mailing of customer bills, unless such a mailing would not provide timely notice, in which case the authority shall authorize an alternative manner of providing such notice. Any such interim rate increase shall only be permitted if the public service company submits an assurance satisfactory to the authority, which may include a bond with surety, of the company's ability and willingness to refund to its customers with interest such amounts as the company may collect from such interim rates in excess of the rates approved by the authority in accordance with subsection (a) of this section. The authority shall order a refund in an amount equal to the excess, if any, of the amount collected pursuant to the interim rates over the amount which would have been collected pursuant to the rates finally approved by the authority in accordance with subsection (a) of this section or fixed at the conclusion of any appeal taken as a result of any finding by the authority. Such refund ordered by the authority shall be paid by the company to its customers in such amounts and by such procedure as ordered by the authority.\n\n(e) If the authority finds that the imposition of any increase in rates would create a hardship for a municipality, because such increase is not reflected in its then current budget, or cannot be included in the budget of its fiscal year which begins less than five months after the effective date of such increase, the authority may defer the applicability of such increase with respect to services furnished to such municipality until the fiscal year of such municipality beginning not less than five months following the effective date of such increase; provided the revenues lost to the public service company through such deferral shall be paid to the public service company by the municipality in its first fiscal year following the period of such deferral.\n\n(f) Any public service company, as defined in section 16-1 , filing an application with the Public Utilities Regulatory Authority to reopen a rate proceeding under this section, which application proposes to increase the company's revenues or any rate or charge of the company by five per cent or more, shall, not later than one week prior to the hearing under the reopened proceeding, notify each customer who would be affected thereby that such an application is being filed. Such notice shall indicate the rate increases proposed in the application. The company shall include the notice in a mailing of customer bills, unless such a mailing would not provide timely notice to customers of the reopening of the proceeding, in which case the authority shall authorize an alternative manner of providing such notice. The authority shall only grant an application by a public service company to reopen a rate proceeding under this section upon a unanimous vote of the utility commissioners.\n\n(g) The authority shall hold either a special public hearing or combine an investigation with an ongoing four-year review conducted in accordance with section 16-19a or with a general rate hearing conducted in accordance with subsection (a) of this section on the need for an interim rate decrease (1) when a public service company has, for the rolling twelve-month period ending with the two most recent consecutive financial quarters, earned a return on equity which exceeds the return authorized by the authority by at least one-half of one percentage point, (2) if it finds that any change in municipal, state or federal tax law creates a significant increase in a company's rate of return, or (3) if it provides appropriate notice that a public service company may be collecting rates or may have an authorized rate of return which is or are more than just, reasonable and adequate, as determined by the authority, provided the authority shall require appropriate notice of hearing to the company and its customers who would be affected by an interim rate decrease in such form as the authority deems reasonable. The company shall be required to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the authority that earning such a return on equity, having an authorized rate of return or collecting rates which are more than just, reasonable and adequate is directly beneficial to its customers. At the completion of the proceeding, the authority may order an interim rate decrease if it finds that such return on equity or rates exceeds a reasonable rate of return or is more than just, reasonable and adequate as determined by the authority. Any such interim rate decrease shall be subject to a customer surcharge if the interim rates collected by the company are less than the rates finally approved by the authority or fixed at the conclusion of any appeal taken as a result of any finding by the authority. Such surcharge shall be assessed against customers in such amounts and by such procedure as ordered by the authority.\n\n(h) The provisions of this section shall not apply to the regulation of a telecommunications service which is a competitive service, as defined in section 16-247a , or to a telecommunications service to which an approved plan for an alternative form of regulation applies, pursuant to section 16-247k .\n\nSee Sec. 16-11 re condition of plant, equipment and manner of operation of public service companies.\n\nSee Sec. 16-19h re reopening of water company rate proceedings.\n\nSee Sec. 16a-49 re conservation and load management program."

These costs, reflecting prudent and efficient management and operations, may include, but are not limited to, the costs of oil, gas, coal, nuclear fuel, wood or other fuels, and energy transactions with other utilities, nonutility generators or power pools, all or part of the cost of conservation and load management, and the gross earnings tax imposed by section 12-264 on the revenues from the energy sources subject to the energy adjustment clause.

The authority shall design any such purchased gas adjustment clause to allow the gas company to charge or to reimburse the consumer only for the changes in the cost of purchased gas which occur when the actual price of purchased gas differs from the price reflected in the base rates of the company.

The authority shall design any such energy adjustment clause to reflect cost-efficient energy resource procurement and to recover the costs of energy that are proper for rate-making purposes and for which the authority has not authorized recovery through base rates. These costs, reflecting prudent and efficient management and operations, may include, but are not limited to, the costs of oil, gas, coal, nuclear fuel, wood or other fuels, and energy transactions with other utilities, nonutility generators or power pools, all or part of the cost of conservation and load management, and the gross earnings tax imposed by section 12-264 on the revenues from the energy sources subject to the energy adjustment clause.

A standard shall be deemed to be appropriate for implementation if such implementation would encourage energy conservation, optimal and efficient use of facilities and resources by an electric public service company and equitable rates for electric consumers.\n\n(c) Each municipal electric company shall (1) not later than July 1, 2018, consider and determine whether it is appropriate to implement any of the following rate design standards: (A) Cost of service; (B) prohibition of declining block rates; (C) time of day rates; (D) seasonal rates; (E) interruptible rates; and (F) load management techniques, and (2) not later than June 1, 2017, consider and determine whether it is appropriate to implement electric vehicle time of day rates for residential and commercial customers. The consideration of said standards by each municipal electric company shall be made after public notice and hearing. Each municipal electric company shall make a determination on whether it is appropriate to implement any of said standards. Said determination shall be in writing, shall take into consideration the evidence presented at the hearing and shall be available to the public. A standard shall be deemed to be appropriate for implementation if such implementation would encourage energy conservation, optimal and efficient use of facilities and resources by a municipal electric company and equitable rates for electric consumers. No municipal electric company that completed such consideration and determination regarding any rate design standard or electric vehicle time of day rate before July 1, 2017, shall be required to conduct another consideration and determination regarding the same such rate design standard or electric vehicle time of day rate.\n\n(d) The Public Utilities Regulatory Authority, with respect to each electric public service company, and each municipal electric company may implement any standard determined under subsection (b) of this section to be appropriate or decline to implement any such standard. If the authority or a municipal electric company declines to implement any standard determined to be appropriate, it shall state in writing its reasons for doing so and make such statement available to the public.\n\n(e) The provisions of this section shall not apply to any municipal electric company which has total annual sales of electricity for purposes other than resale of five hundred million kilowatt-hours or less.\n\nSee chapter 101 re municipal electric companies."

The authority shall investigate and, not more than sixty days after receipt of a petition, (1) if appropriate, issue an order prescribing the service to be furnished by the company, the conditions under which and maximum rates or charges at which the service shall be furnished, or (2) order that a hearing be held on the matter or that the matter be set for alternative dispute resolution. If at any time during such sixty-day period, any party in interest requests a hearing, the authority shall, after notice to all parties and not more than ninety days after receiving the request, hold a hearing and, if appropriate, issue an order prescribing the service to be furnished by the company and the conditions under which and maximum rates or charges at which the service shall be furnished.\n\n(c) The authority, on its own initiative, or upon request by the Commissioner of Public Health, may initiate an investigation to determine whether the rates of a small community water system are inadequate for such water system to maintain economic viability and provide adequate service to its customers. As used in this subsection, “small community water system” means a water system that is not required to submit a water supply plan under section 25-32d . The authority shall, not more than one hundred fifty days after the commencement of such investigation, if appropriate, issue an order prescribing the appropriate service to be furnished by the water system and the appropriate rates or charges that are necessary to furnish such service. Prior to the issuance of any such order raising rates or charges of such water system's customers, the authority, in consultation with the Office of Consumer Counsel and the Attorney General, shall consider the financial impact that any such rate increase may have on such water system's ratepayers. If such rate increase is one hundred per cent or more, such increase shall be phased in over the course of a two-year period. If at any time during such investigation any party in interest requests a hearing, the authority shall, after notice to all parties and not more than thirty days after receiving the request, hold a hearing and, if appropriate, issue an order prescribing the service to be furnished by the small community water system and the appropriate rates or charges at which the service shall be furnished. If such hearing is held, the authority shall have commensurate additional time to issue such order."

Any such disposition of an essential part of such other real property of a public service company shall be by public auction or other procedure for public sale, provided such auction or public sale shall be conducted upon notice of auction or sale published at least once each week for two weeks preceding the date of such auction or sale in a newspaper having a substantial circulation in the county in which such property is located. The public service company shall submit evidence to the authority of the notice given. On a showing of good cause by such company to use a means of disposal other than by public auction or other procedure for public sale, the authority may, on a finding of such good cause, authorize the use of an alternative sales process. No public auction or other procedure for public sale shall be required for the sale or other disposition of real property by a water company to the state, a municipality or land conservation organization if at least seventy per cent of the area of the real property sold or disposed of is to be used for open space or recreational purposes, as defined in subsection (f) of section 16-50d , and if the consideration received for such sale or disposition is not less than the appraised value of such property. A public service company other than a water company may sell, lease, assign, mortgage or otherwise dispose of improved real property with an appraised value of two hundred fifty thousand dollars or less or unimproved real property with an appraised value of fifty thousand dollars or less without such approval. The authority shall follow the procedures in section 16-50c for transactions involving unimproved land owned by a public service company other than a water company. A water company supplying water to more than five hundred consumers may sell, lease, assign, mortgage, or otherwise dispose of real property, other than public watershed or water supply lands, with an appraised value of fifty thousand dollars or less without such approval. The authority shall not accept an application to sell watershed or water supply lands until the Commissioner of Public Health issues a permit pursuant to section 25-32 . The condemnation by a state department, institution or agency of any land owned by a public service company shall be subject to the provisions of this subsection. On February 1, 1996, and annually thereafter, each public service company shall submit a report to the Public Utilities Regulatory Authority of all real property sold, leased, assigned, mortgaged, or otherwise disposed of without the approval of said authority during the previous calendar year. Such report shall include for each transaction involving such property, without limitation, the appraised value of the real property, the actual value of the transaction and the accounting journal entry which recorded the transaction.\n\n(b) A public service company shall obtain the approval of the Public Utilities Regulatory Authority to (1) issue any notes, bonds or other evidences of indebtedness or securities of any nature, (2) lend or borrow any moneys for a period of more than one year for any purpose other than paying the expenses, including taxes, of conducting its business or for the payment of dividends, or (3) amend any provision of an indenture or similar financial instrument if such amendment would affect the issuance or terms of any such notes, bonds or other evidences of indebtedness or securities. The authority shall approve or disapprove each such issue or amendment within sixty days after the filing of a written application for such approval unless the applicant agrees to an extension of time. If not disapproved within said sixty days or within such extension, such issue shall be deemed to be approved. The authority shall not require a company to issue its common stock under terms or conditions not required by the general statutes. The provisions of this subsection shall apply to a community antenna television company only with regard to any noncable communications services which the company may provide.\n\n(c) Any managerial service contract made by a public service company shall be voidable on order of the authority, but may be enforced as between the parties unless disapproved.\n\n(d) Any water company selling land that at any time has been in the water company's rate base shall use the net proceeds from the sale of such land for capital projects which improve or protect the water supply system or for the acquisition of a water supply source or land to protect a water supply source. In the case of a water company required to file a water supply plan pursuant to section 25-32d , the capital projects or acquisition shall be consistent with such plan.\n\n(e) For the purposes of rate making, the authority shall use an accounting method for allocating the economic benefits of sales of land by a water company, as defined in section 16-1 , that at any time has been in the water company's rate base that equitably allocates all of the economic benefits of any such sale between the ratepayers and the shareholders of the company based on the facts of each application for sale, except as follows:\n\n(1) For any sale of land where the property is not more than ten acres and has not been taxed under the provisions of sections 12-107c to 12-107e , inclusive, during the previous ten years, the authority shall equitably allocate all of the economic benefits of any such sale between the ratepayers and the shareholders of the company. Any such allocation shall be based on the facts of each application for sale and the authority may allocate all of the economic benefits of any such sale to either the ratepayers or the shareholders.\n\n(2) For a sale of class I or class II land to another water company for water supply purposes or to the state, a municipality, or a land conservation organization, which land has a permanent conservation easement in accordance with section 25-32 , the authority shall equitably allocate, in a contested case proceeding, all of the economic benefits of any such sale between the ratepayers and the shareholders of the company.\n\n(3) For the sale of land for an educational use, as defined in section 16-43b , the authority shall allocate the economic benefits of any such sale in accordance with past practices for nonopen space transactions pursuant to subsection (a) of this section.\n\n(4) For the sale of class III land where the property is more than ten acres and promotes a perpetual public interest in the use of land for open space or recreation purposes, as defined in section 16-43b , the authority shall allocate the benefits in accordance with the following:\n\n(A) If twenty-five per cent of the land or less is to be used for open space or recreational purposes, the authority shall allocate one hundred per cent of the benefits to the ratepayers;\n\n(B) If more than twenty-five per cent but less than eighty per cent of the land is to be used for open space or recreational purposes, the authority shall calculate the benefit allocated to a water company's shareholders by multiplying by a factor of eighty per cent of the portion of class III land in the transaction that is reserved for open space;\n\n(C) If eighty per cent or more but less than ninety per cent of the area of such land is to be used for open space or recreational purposes, the authority shall allocate the benefits of such sale in favor of a water company's shareholders in an amount that is proportionate to the percentage of class III land in such sale that is to be used for open space or recreational purposes;\n\n(D) If not less than ninety per cent of the area of such land is to be used for open space or recreational purposes, the authority shall allocate one hundred per cent of the benefits to the shareholders.\n\n(f) For the sale of class III land by a water company that at any time has been in the water company's rate base and that is to be used for open space or recreational purposes, the water company shall file with the authority a certified copy of a conservation easement that is recorded on the land records for the portion of class III land preserved as open space. Such conservation easement shall state that the land subject to such easement shall be permanently dedicated for land uses such as public parks or forests or natural areas, including, but not limited to, reservoirs and water company land. Such land shall be preserved predominantly in its natural scenic and open space condition that may allow for camping, hiking, forestry, fishing, wildlife or natural resource conservation, which easement shall prohibit all other building or development except as may be required for source protection and to meet water quality standards, if used as a public water supply."

If a recipient of notice under this subsection enters into a contract to purchase such land, the closing on the sale shall take place not later than twelve months after the contract is entered into unless the period for closing is extended by mutual agreement of the parties to the contract. No agreement to sell, lease or otherwise dispose of such land may be entered into by such water company except as provided in this section. Any private, nonprofit land-holding organization which is considering acquiring the interest in the land which the water company intends to sell, lease or dispose of must identify itself as a potential acquirer by giving written notice to the Public Utilities Regulatory Authority and to the water company by certified mail, return receipt requested, not more than ninety days after the water company files an application for approval. The authority shall approve or disapprove the disposition of such property pursuant to subsection (a) of section 16-43 not more than one hundred fifty days after its receipt of an application for such sale, lease or other disposition pursuant to this subsection and failure to take action within such period shall be deemed to constitute approval. The authority shall hold a hearing on all such land transactions in which the acquisition cost of the parcels involved or the transfer consideration is in excess of fifty thousand dollars. The hearing shall be held in the municipality where such land is located. If such land is located in more than one municipality, the authority shall determine in which municipality the hearing shall be held. If the hearing is scheduled for more than one day or continues for more than one day, the authority may reconvene the hearing at the offices of the authority. An application shall not be filed with the authority until the Commissioner of Public Health issues a permit pursuant to section 25-32 . The municipality in which such land is situated shall be a party to all proceedings before the authority involving such land brought pursuant to sections 16-50b to 16-50e , inclusive.\n\n(c) If, by the end of the ninety-day period for written notice under subdivision (1) of subsection (b) of this section, no recipient of such notice has entered into an agreement or option to acquire the land, the water company may offer the land for sale, lease or other disposition to any person. Any such recipient of notice, upon entering into a contract which provides for an option to acquire such land, shall pay reasonable consideration for such option with due regard for the market value of the land. Such consideration shall be applied, without interest, as a credit against the purchase price if the option is exercised. Any such consideration shall not be refundable unless the authority disapproves the disposition of such land."

              "(b) (1) Prior to granting an applicant's certificate for a facility described in subdivision (5) or (6) of subsection (a) of section 16-50i , the council shall examine, in addition to its consideration of subdivisions (1) to (3), inclusive, of subsection (a) of this section: (A) The feasibility of requiring an applicant to share an existing facility, as defined in subsection (b) of section 16-50aa , within a technically derived search area of the site of the proposed facility, provided such shared use is technically, legally, environmentally and economically feasible and meets public safety concerns, (B) whether such facility, if constructed, may be shared with any public or private entity that provides telecommunications or community antenna television service to the public, provided such shared use is technically, legally, environmentally and economically feasible at fair market rates, meets public safety concerns, and the parties' interests have been considered, (C) whether the proposed facility would be located in an area of the state which the council, in consultation with the Department of Energy and Environmental Protection and any affected municipalities, finds to be a relatively undisturbed area that possesses scenic quality of local, regional or state-wide significance, and (D) the latest facility design options intended to minimize aesthetic and environmental impacts. The council may deny an application for a certificate if it determines that (i) shared use under the provisions of subparagraph (A) of this subdivision is feasible, (ii) the applicant would not cooperate relative to the future shared use of the proposed facility, (iii) the proposed facility would substantially affect the scenic quality of its location or surrounding neighborhood and no public safety concerns require that the proposed facility be constructed in such a location, or (iv) no public safety concerns require that a proposed facility owned or operated by the state be constructed in that location. In evaluating the public need for a cellular facility described in subdivision (6) of subsection (a) of section 16-50i , there shall be a presumption of public need for personal wireless services and the council shall be limited to consideration of a specific need for any proposed facility to be used to provide such services to the public.",
              "(2) When issuing a certificate for a facility described in subdivision (5) or (6) of subsection (a) of section 16-50i , the council may impose such reasonable conditions as it deems necessary to promote immediate and future shared use of such facilities and avoid the unnecessary proliferation of such facilities in the state. The council shall, prior to issuing a certificate, provide notice of the proposed facility to the municipality in which the facility is to be located. Upon motion of the council, written request by a public or private entity that provides telecommunications or community antenna television service to the public or upon written request by an interested party, the council may conduct a preliminary investigation to determine whether the holder of a certificate for such a facility is in compliance with the certificate. Following its investigation, the council may initiate a certificate review proceeding, which shall include a hearing, to determine whether the holder of a certificate for such a facility is in compliance with the certificate. In such proceeding, the council shall render a decision and may issue orders it deems necessary to compel compliance with the certificate, which may include, but not be limited to, revocation of the certificate. Such orders may be enforced in accordance with the provisions of section 16-50u .",
              "(c) (1) The council shall not grant a certificate for a facility described in subdivision (3) of subsection (a) of section 16-50i , either as proposed or as modified by the council, unless it finds and determines a public benefit for the facility and considers neighborhood concerns with respect to the factors set forth in subdivision (3) of subsection (a) of this section, including public safety.",
              "(2) (A) On and after October 1, 2025, the council shall not grant a certificate for a facility described in subdivision (1) of subsection (a) of section 16-50i , either as proposed or as modified by the council, unless the council finds and determines a public need for the facility and considers neighborhood concerns with respect to the factors set forth in subdivision (3) of subsection (a) of this section, including public safety and the impact that the proposed facility is anticipated to have on the tax base of any municipality where any part of such facility is proposed to be located.",
              "(B) The certificate holder shall include in any development and management plan submitted to the council on and after October 1, 2025, for a facility described in subdivision (1) of subsection (a) of section 16-50i , or any modification of such a facility: (i) The estimated cost for the facility or modification, as applicable, based on the design in the development and management plan and current cost information, and (ii) the estimated regionalized and localized costs using such estimated cost. If either (I) such estimate of costs based on the design in the development and management plan and current cost information, or (II) such estimate of localized costs is greater than one hundred ten per cent of the estimated initial, life-cycle or localized costs for the facility or modification, as applicable, determined by the council pursuant to subparagraph (D)(ii) of subdivision (3) of subsection (a) of this section, the certificate holder shall include in the development and management plan a detailed analysis of the difference in cost estimates and shall provide any additional information requested by any member of the council or by any intervenors to the proceeding.",

              "(3) For purposes of this section, a public benefit exists when a facility is necessary for the reliability of the electric power supply of the state or for the development of a competitive market for electricity and a public need exists when a facility is necessary for the reliability of the electric power supply of the state.",
              "(4) Any application for an electric transmission line with a capacity of three hundred forty-five kilovolts or more that is filed on or after May 1, 2003, and proposes the underground burial of such line in all residential areas and overhead installation of such line in industrial and open space areas shall have a rebuttable presumption of meeting a public benefit for such facility if the facility is substantially underground and meeting a public need for such facility if the facility is substantially above ground. Such presumption may be overcome by evidence submitted by a party or intervenor to the satisfaction of the council.",
              "(5) The council shall not grant a certificate for a facility described in subdivision (3) of subsection (a) of section 16-50i that is a solar photovoltaic facility if it finds that (A) such facility will not comply with any noise requirements established pursuant to chapter 442, or (B) the distance between any inverters or transformers of such facility and the property line is less than two hundred feet.",
              "(6) The council shall not grant a certificate, either as proposed or as modified by the council, unless it (A) provides summaries and written responses to any comments that the Departments of Administrative Services, Agriculture, Economic and Community Development, Energy and Environmental Protection, Emergency Services and Public Protection, Public Health and Transportation, the Labor Department, the Council on Environmental Quality, the Public Utilities Regulatory Authority, the Office of Policy and Management or the Office of Consumer Counsel submits pursuant to subsection (i) of section 16-50j and (B) provides written responses to the positions of each intervenor that participated in the certification proceeding concerning such certificate. The council shall specifically address any environmental justice concerns raised in the comments of said departments, Council on Environmental Quality, authority and offices, or in the positions of any such intervenor, in such written responses.",
              "(d) If the council determines that the location of all or a part of the proposed facility should be modified, it may condition the certificate upon such modification, provided the municipalities affected by the modification and the residents of such municipalities shall have had notice of the application pursuant to subsection (b) of section 16-50 l .",
              "(e) In an amendment proceeding, the council shall render a decision not later than ninety days after the filing of the application or adoption of the resolution initiating the proceeding. The council shall file an opinion with its order stating its reasons for the decision. The council's decision shall include the findings and determinations enumerated in subsection (a) of this section which are relevant to the proposed amendment.",
              "(f) The council shall serve a copy of the order and opinion issued therewith upon each party and publish a notice of the issuance of the order and opinion in such newspapers as will serve substantially to inform the public of the issuance of such order and opinion. The name and address of each party shall be set forth in the order.",
              "(g) In deciding whether to issue a certificate, the council shall in no way be limited by the applicant already having acquired land or an interest therein for the purpose of constructing the facility that is the subject of its application.",
              "(h) For purposes of this section, a public need exists for an energy facility if such facility is necessary for the reliability of the electric power supply of the state.",
              "(i) For a facility described in subdivision (1) of subsection (a) of section 16-50i , with a capacity of not less than three hundred forty-five kilovolts, the presumption shall be that a proposal to place the overhead portions, if any, of such facility adjacent to residential areas, private or public schools, licensed child care centers, licensed youth camps or public playgrounds is inconsistent with the purposes of this chapter. An applicant may rebut this presumption by demonstrating to the council that burying the facility will be technologically infeasible. In determining such infeasibility, the council shall consider the effect of burying the facility on the reliability of the electric transmission system of the state and whether the cost of any contemplated technology or design configuration may result in an unreasonable economic burden on the ratepayers of the state.",
              "(j) Upon a motion of a party or intervenor or a council determination that any party or intervenor relating to a facility described in subdivision (5) or (6) of subsection (a) of section 16-50i has intentionally omitted or misrepresented a material fact in the course of a council proceeding, the council may, by majority vote, request the Attorney General to bring a civil action against such party or intervenor. In any such action, the Attorney General may seek any legal or equitable relief the Superior Court deems appropriate, including, but not limited to, injunctive relief or a civil penalty of not more than ten thousand dollars and reasonable attorney fees and related costs."

The council shall not render any decision pursuant to this subparagraph that is inconsistent with federal law or regulations; and\n\n(G) That, for a facility described in subdivision (5) or (6) of subsection (a) of section 16-50i , the council has considered the manufacturer's recommended safety standards for any equipment, machinery or technology for the facility.\n\n(H) For a facility described in subdivision (3) of section 16-50i that is a solar photovoltaic facility, that the council has evaluated potential noise levels of the proposed facility in conformance with scientifically accepted methods for noise assessment.\n\n(b) (1) Prior to granting an applicant's certificate for a facility described in subdivision (5) or (6) of subsection (a) of section 16-50i , the council shall examine, in addition to its consideration of subdivisions (1) to (3), inclusive, of subsection (a) of this section: (A) The feasibility of requiring an applicant to share an existing facility, as defined in subsection (b) of section 16-50aa , within a technically derived search area of the site of the proposed facility, provided such shared use is technically, legally, environmentally and economically feasible and meets public safety concerns, (B) whether such facility, if constructed, may be shared with any public or private entity that provides telecommunications or community antenna television service to the public, provided such shared use is technically, legally, environmentally and economically feasible at fair market rates, meets public safety concerns, and the parties' interests have been considered, (C) whether the proposed facility would be located in an area of the state which the council, in consultation with the Department of Energy and Environmental Protection and any affected municipalities, finds to be a relatively undisturbed area that possesses scenic quality of local, regional or state-wide significance, and (D) the latest facility design options intended to minimize aesthetic and environmental impacts. The council may deny an application for a certificate if it determines that (i) shared use under the provisions of subparagraph (A) of this subdivision is feasible, (ii) the applicant would not cooperate relative to the future shared use of the proposed facility, (iii) the proposed facility would substantially affect the scenic quality of its location or surrounding neighborhood and no public safety concerns require that the proposed facility be constructed in such a location, or (iv) no public safety concerns require that a proposed facility owned or operated by the state be constructed in that location. In evaluating the public need for a cellular facility described in subdivision (6) of subsection (a) of section 16-50i , there shall be a presumption of public need for personal wireless services and the council shall be limited to consideration of a specific need for any proposed facility to be used to provide such services to the public.\n\n(2) When issuing a certificate for a facility described in subdivision (5) or (6) of subsection (a) of section 16-50i , the council may impose such reasonable conditions as it deems necessary to promote immediate and future shared use of such facilities and avoid the unnecessary proliferation of such facilities in the state. The council shall, prior to issuing a certificate, provide notice of the proposed facility to the municipality in which the facility is to be located. Upon motion of the council, written request by a public or private entity that provides telecommunications or community antenna television service to the public or upon written request by an interested party, the council may conduct a preliminary investigation to determine whether the holder of a certificate for such a facility is in compliance with the certificate. Following its investigation, the council may initiate a certificate review proceeding, which shall include a hearing, to determine whether the holder of a certificate for such a facility is in compliance with the certificate. In such proceeding, the council shall render a decision and may issue orders it deems necessary to compel compliance with the certificate, which may include, but not be limited to, revocation of the certificate. Such orders may be enforced in accordance with the provisions of section 16-50u .\n\n(c) (1) The council shall not grant a certificate for a facility described in subdivision (3) of subsection (a) of section 16-50i , either as proposed or as modified by the council, unless it finds and determines a public benefit for the facility and considers neighborhood concerns with respect to the factors set forth in subdivision (3) of subsection (a) of this section, including public safety.\n\n(2) (A) On and after October 1, 2025, the council shall not grant a certificate for a facility described in subdivision (1) of subsection (a) of section 16-50i , either as proposed or as modified by the council, unless the council finds and determines a public need for the facility and considers neighborhood concerns with respect to the factors set forth in subdivision (3) of subsection (a) of this section, including public safety and the impact that the proposed facility is anticipated to have on the tax base of any municipality where any part of such facility is proposed to be located.\n\n(B) The certificate holder shall include in any development and management plan submitted to the council on and after October 1, 2025, for a facility described in subdivision (1) of subsection (a) of section 16-50i , or any modification of such a facility: (i) The estimated cost for the facility or modification, as applicable, based on the design in the development and management plan and current cost information, and (ii) the estimated regionalized and localized costs using such estimated cost. If either (I) such estimate of costs based on the design in the development and management plan and current cost information, or (II) such estimate of localized costs is greater than one hundred ten per cent of the estimated initial, life-cycle or localized costs for the facility or modification, as applicable, determined by the council pursuant to subparagraph (D)(ii) of subdivision (3) of subsection (a) of this section, the certificate holder shall include in the development and management plan a detailed analysis of the difference in cost estimates and shall provide any additional information requested by any member of the council or by any intervenors to the proceeding.\n\n(C) The council shall not grant a certificate for a facility described in subdivision (1) of subsection (a) of section 16-50i , that is substantially underground or underwater except where such facility interconnects with existing overhead facilities, either as proposed or as modified by the council, unless it finds and determines a public benefit for a facility substantially underground or a public need for a facility substantially underwater.\n\n(3) For purposes of this section, a public benefit exists when a facility is necessary for the reliability of the electric power supply of the state or for the development of a competitive market for electricity and a public need exists when a facility is necessary for the reliability of the electric power supply of the state.\n\n(4) Any application for an electric transmission line with a capacity of three hundred forty-five kilovolts or more that is filed on or after May 1, 2003, and proposes the underground burial of such line in all residential areas and overhead installation of such line in industrial and open space areas shall have a rebuttable presumption of meeting a public benefit for such facility if the facility is substantially underground and meeting a public need for such facility if the facility is substantially above ground. Such presumption may be overcome by evidence submitted by a party or intervenor to the satisfaction of the council.\n\n(5) The council shall not grant a certificate for a facility described in subdivision (3) of subsection (a) of section 16-50i that is a solar photovoltaic facility if it finds that (A) such facility will not comply with any noise requirements established pursuant to chapter 442, or (B) the distance between any inverters or transformers of such facility and the property line is less than two hundred feet.\n\n(6) The council shall not grant a certificate, either as proposed or as modified by the council, unless it (A) provides summaries and written responses to any comments that the Departments of Administrative Services, Agriculture, Economic and Community Development, Energy and Environmental Protection, Emergency Services and Public Protection, Public Health and Transportation, the Labor Department, the Council on Environmental Quality, the Public Utilities Regulatory Authority, the Office of Policy and Management or the Office of Consumer Counsel submits pursuant to subsection (i) of section 16-50j and (B) provides written responses to the positions of each intervenor that participated in the certification proceeding concerning such certificate. The council shall specifically address any environmental justice concerns raised in the comments of said departments, Council on Environmental Quality, authority and offices, or in the positions of any such intervenor, in such written responses.\n\n(d) If the council determines that the location of all or a part of the proposed facility should be modified, it may condition the certificate upon such modification, provided the municipalities affected by the modification and the residents of such municipalities shall have had notice of the application pursuant to subsection (b) of section 16-50 l .\n\n(e) In an amendment proceeding, the council shall render a decision not later than ninety days after the filing of the application or adoption of the resolution initiating the proceeding. The council shall file an opinion with its order stating its reasons for the decision. The council's decision shall include the findings and determinations enumerated in subsection (a) of this section which are relevant to the proposed amendment.\n\n(f) The council shall serve a copy of the order and opinion issued therewith upon each party and publish a notice of the issuance of the order and opinion in such newspapers as will serve substantially to inform the public of the issuance of such order and opinion. The name and address of each party shall be set forth in the order.\n\n(g) In deciding whether to issue a certificate, the council shall in no way be limited by the applicant already having acquired land or an interest therein for the purpose of constructing the facility that is the subject of its application.\n\n(h) For purposes of this section, a public need exists for an energy facility if such facility is necessary for the reliability of the electric power supply of the state.\n\n(i) For a facility described in subdivision (1) of subsection (a) of section 16-50i , with a capacity of not less than three hundred forty-five kilovolts, the presumption shall be that a proposal to place the overhead portions, if any, of such facility adjacent to residential areas, private or public schools, licensed child care centers, licensed youth camps or public playgrounds is inconsistent with the purposes of this chapter. An applicant may rebut this presumption by demonstrating to the council that burying the facility will be technologically infeasible. In determining such infeasibility, the council shall consider the effect of burying the facility on the reliability of the electric transmission system of the state and whether the cost of any contemplated technology or design configuration may result in an unreasonable economic burden on the ratepayers of the state.\n\n(j) Upon a motion of a party or intervenor or a council determination that any party or intervenor relating to a facility described in subdivision (5) or (6) of subsection (a) of section 16-50i has intentionally omitted or misrepresented a material fact in the course of a council proceeding, the council may, by majority vote, request the Attorney General to bring a civil action against such party or intervenor. In any such action, the Attorney General may seek any legal or equitable relief the Superior Court deems appropriate, including, but not limited to, injunctive relief or a civil penalty of not more than ten thousand dollars and reasonable attorney fees and related costs."

The council may assess civil penalties in an amount not less than one thousand dollars per day for each day of construction or operation in material violation of this chapter, or in material violation of any certificate issued pursuant to this chapter. Civil proceedings to enforce this chapter may be brought by the Attorney General in the superior court for any judicial district affected by the violation. The remedies and penalties in this section shall be cumulative and shall be in addition to any other penalties and remedies available at law, or in equity, to any person.\n\n(c) If the council has reason to believe that a violation has occurred for which a civil penalty is authorized pursuant to subsection (b) of this section, the council shall notify the alleged violator by certified mail, return receipt requested, or by personal service. The notice shall include:\n\n(1) A reference to any applicable section of this title, council regulation or certificate, or to any condition or requirement of such certificate;\n\n(2) A short and plain statement of the matter asserted or charged;\n\n(3) A statement of the prescribed civil penalty for the violation; and\n\n(4) A statement of the person's right to a hearing.\n\n(d) The person to whom the notice is addressed shall have twenty days from the date of receipt of the notice in which to deliver to the council a written application for a hearing. If a hearing is requested, then, after a hearing and upon a finding that a violation has occurred, the council may issue a final order assessing a civil penalty under this section which shall not be greater than the maximum penalty permitted by subsection (b) of this section. If a hearing is not requested, or if such a request is later withdrawn, then the notice shall, on the first day after the expiration of the twenty-day period or on the first day after the withdrawal of the request for hearing, whichever is later, become a final order of the council and the matters asserted or charged in the notice shall be deemed admitted, unless the notice is modified by a consent order before it becomes a final order. A consent order shall be deemed a final order.\n\n(e) All hearings under this section shall be conducted in accordance with sections 4-176e to 4-184 , inclusive. Any final order of the council assessing a civil penalty shall be subject to appeal under section 4-183 .

Any civil penalty authorized by this section shall become due and payable (1) at the time of receipt of a final order, in the case of a civil penalty assessed in such order after a hearing, (2) on the first day after the expiration of the period in which a hearing may be requested, if no hearing is requested, or (3) on the first day after the withdrawal of a request for hearing.\n\n(f) Any civil penalty assessed in a final order of the council under this section may be enforced in the same manner as a judgment of the Superior Court. The council shall deliver the final order to the person found to be in violation by personal service or by certified mail, return receipt requested. After entry of such final order, the council may file a transcript without the payment of costs, in the office of the clerk of the superior court in the judicial district in which such person resides, has a place of business, owns real property, or where any real property that is the subject of the proceedings is located or, if such person is not a resident of the state, in the judicial district of Hartford. Upon such filing, the clerk shall docket the order in the same manner and with the same effect as a judgment entered in the superior court within the judicial district. Upon the docketing, the order may be enforced as a judgment of the court.\n\n(g) Such court may grant such restraining orders, and such temporary and permanent injunctive relief, as may be necessary to secure compliance with this chapter and with a certificate issued pursuant to this chapter, including, but not limited to, requiring modifications to the layout of a facility or the installation of noise-dampening materials or equipment to comply with noise level restrictions required pursuant to such a certificate."

In ruling on applications for certificates or petitions for a declaratory ruling for facilities and on requests for shared use of facilities, the council shall give such consideration to other state laws and municipal regulations as it shall deem appropriate. Whenever the council certifies a facility pursuant to this chapter, such certification shall satisfy and be in lieu of all certifications, approvals and other requirements of state and municipal agencies in regard to any questions of public need, convenience and necessity for such facility.",

If such application is dismissed, no assessment of damages is made, or the proceedings are abandoned by said applicant, said court or judge shall direct that the money so deposited, so far as it may be necessary, shall be applied to the payment of any damages that the owner of said property or other parties in interest may have sustained by such entry upon and use of such property, including reasonable attorneys', engineers' and appraisers' fees and other reasonable expenses incurred by such owner or other parties in interest in connection with such proceedings, and the costs and expenses of such proceedings. Such damages shall be ascertained by said court or judge or a committee to be appointed for that purpose, and if the sum so deposited shall be insufficient to pay such damages and all costs and expenses so assessed, judgment shall be entered against said applicant for the deficiency to be enforced and collected in the same manner as a judgment in the Superior Court, and the possession of such property shall be restored to the owner or owners thereof.",

In ruling on applications for certificates or petitions for a declaratory ruling for facilities and on requests for shared use of facilities, the council shall give such consideration to other state laws and municipal regulations as it shall deem appropriate. Whenever the council certifies a facility pursuant to this chapter, such certification shall satisfy and be in lieu of all certifications, approvals and other requirements of state and municipal agencies in regard to any questions of public need, convenience and necessity for such facility.\n\n(b) Whenever the council has certified a facility pursuant to this chapter, any person joining in the application for such certification shall be empowered to exercise its powers of eminent domain, granted by the general statutes or any special act, to acquire property for such facility for the benefit of all persons receiving such certificates.\n\n(c) Whenever the council has certified a facility pursuant to this chapter and the applicant for such certificate thereafter initiates condemnation proceedings to acquire property for such facility, and it shall appear to the court or judge before whom such proceedings are pending that the public interest will be prejudiced by delay, said court or judge may direct that said applicant be permitted to enter immediately upon the property to be taken and devote it temporarily to the public use specified in the application instituting such proceeding upon the deposit with said court of a sum to be fixed by said court or judge, upon notice to the parties of not less than ten days, and such sum when fixed and paid shall be applied to the payment of any assessment of damages which may be made, with interest thereon from the date of such entry upon said property, and the remainder, if any, returned to said applicant. If such application is dismissed, no assessment of damages is made, or the proceedings are abandoned by said applicant, said court or judge shall direct that the money so deposited, so far as it may be necessary, shall be applied to the payment of any damages that the owner of said property or other parties in interest may have sustained by such entry upon and use of such property, including reasonable attorneys', engineers' and appraisers' fees and other reasonable expenses incurred by such owner or other parties in interest in connection with such proceedings, and the costs and expenses of such proceedings. Such damages shall be ascertained by said court or judge or a committee to be appointed for that purpose, and if the sum so deposited shall be insufficient to pay such damages and all costs and expenses so assessed, judgment shall be entered against said applicant for the deficiency to be enforced and collected in the same manner as a judgment in the Superior Court, and the possession of such property shall be restored to the owner or owners thereof.\n\n(d) Any town, city or borough zoning commission and inland wetland agency may regulate and restrict the proposed location of a facility, as defined in subdivisions (3) and (4) of subsection (a) of section 16-50i .

If the parties submit their dispute to arbitration and a party is not satisfied with the ruling of the arbitrator, any party may petition the Superior Court to determine the issue. If either party petitions the Superior Court to determine the issue of fair compensation, the petition shall be submitted to the superior court for the judicial district in which the facility is located. The Public Utilities Regulatory Authority shall accept, absent good cause to the contrary, the ruling of the arbitrator or the decision of the Superior Court, as the case may be, for rate-making purposes.\n\n(2) If a public service company owns a facility which is used to provide a regulated service and another entity shares or will share the use of such facility pursuant to the provisions of this subsection, the public service company shall incorporate the agreement of the parties, the ruling of the arbitrator or the decision of the Superior Court, as the case may be, regarding compensation for shared use of the facility in a tariff, special contract or other applicable filing submitted by the owner to the Public Utilities Regulatory Authority.\n\n(e) The council, in consultation with the parties involved, shall determine the expenses associated with the proceedings set forth in this subsection, except expenses associated with any petition or appeal taken to the Superior Court, prior to their expenditure. All such expenses shall be borne by the person, firm, corporation, or public agency which seeks shared use of a facility under the provisions of this section."

If the department approves a request, the Commissioner of Energy and Environmental Protection shall use the Telecommunications License Agreement, forms and fee structure developed pursuant to subsection (g) of this section to execute a license agreement with the wireless carrier or permitted entity that submitted the approved request within thirty days of such approval, provided any such agreement shall be approved by the Secretary of the Office of Policy and Management and the Attorney General. Said commissioner shall administer any license agreement executed pursuant to this subparagraph. Nothing in this subdivision shall be deemed to require the Department of Energy and Environmental Protection to make Department of Energy and Environmental Protection property available for the siting of personal wireless service facilities.\n\n(f) (1) A wireless carrier or permitted entity may request to use Department of Transportation public right-of-way property for the placement, construction, maintenance and operation of small wireless facilities in accordance with this subsection.\n\n(2) The Department of Transportation shall make highways and Department of Transportation public rights-of-way available for placement, construction, maintenance and operation of small wireless facilities in accordance with any applicable Federal Communications Commission regulations, rulings or orders.

Any master plan or equivalent plan submitted pursuant to this section may be used by the council in the administration of this section and shall be deemed a trade secret and exempt from public disclosure pursuant to section 1-210 , and shall be marked as such by the council.\n\n(i) Nothing in this section shall be construed to prohibit a wireless carrier or permitted entity from requesting the use of property owned by the state that is not subject to this section for the installation of personal wireless service facilities or small wireless facilities. Such request shall be made to the state agency that owns such property. Any agency that receives a request pursuant to this subsection shall grant or reject such request not later than ninety days after receiving such request.\n\n(j) Nothing in this section shall be construed to supersede any existing rules and requirements that require the review and approval of permits for proposed personal wireless service facilities that are subject to the jurisdiction of the Connecticut Siting Council and the Public Utilities Regulatory Authority."

              "(b) Each electric public service company, municipal electric energy cooperative and municipal electric utility shall: (1) Purchase any electrical energy and capacity made available, directly by a private power producer or indirectly under subdivision (4) of this subsection; (2) sell backup electricity to any private power producer in its service territory; (3) make such interconnections in accordance with the regulations adopted pursuant to subsection (h) of this section necessary to accomplish such purchases and sales; (4) upon approval by the Public Utilities Regulatory Authority of an application filed by a willing private power producer, transmit energy or capacity from the private power producer to any other such company, cooperative or utility or to another facility operated by the private power producer; and (5) offer to operate in parallel with a private power producer. In making a decision on an application filed under subdivision (4) of this subsection, the authority shall consider whether such transmission would (A) adversely impact the customers of the company, cooperative or utility which would transmit energy or capacity to the private power producer, (B) result in an uncompensated loss for, or unduly burden, such company, cooperative, utility or private power producer, (C) impair the reliability of service of such company, cooperative or utility, or (D) impair the ability of the company, cooperative or utility to provide adequate service to its customers. The authority shall issue a decision on such an application not later than one hundred twenty days after the application is filed, provided, the authority may, before the end of such period and upon notifying all parties and intervenors to the proceeding, extend the period by thirty days. If the authority does not issue a decision within one hundred twenty days after receiving such an application, or within one hundred fifty days if the authority extends the period in accordance with the provisions of this subsection, the application shall be deemed to have been approved. The requirements under subdivisions (3), (4) and (5) of this subsection shall be subject to reasonable standards for operating safety and reliability and the nondiscriminatory assessment of costs against private power producers, approved by the Public Utilities Regulatory Authority with respect to electric public service companies or determined by municipal electric energy cooperatives and municipal electric utilities.",
              "(c) The Public Utilities Regulatory Authority, with respect to electric public service companies, and each municipal electric energy cooperative and municipal electric utility shall establish rates and conditions of service for: (1) The purchase of electrical energy and capacity made available by a private power producer; and (2) the sale of backup electricity to a private power producer. The rates for electricity purchased from a private power producer shall be based on the full avoided costs of the electric public service company, municipal electric energy cooperative or municipal electric utility, regardless of whether the purchaser is simultaneously making sales to the private power producer. Payment for energy and capacity purchased from a private power producer by any such company, cooperative or utility shall be pursuant to such rates and conditions or the terms of a contract between the parties. The rates and conditions of service for the purchase of energy and capacity established by the authority pursuant to this subsection shall include specific schedules for pricing in long-term contracts for the sale of electricity from small renewable power projects to electric public service companies by private power producers. Such schedules shall not exceed the present worth of the projected avoided costs of the electric public service company over the term of the contract. The authority shall apply to a proposed contract filed with the authority after January 1, 1992, by a private power producer for a small renewable power project the rates and conditions of service, including the pricing schedule, in effect on the date the private power producer submits its proposed contract to the authority, regardless of the subsequent creation of differing schedules or the subsequent amendment of existing schedules.",
              "(d) When any person, firm or corporation proposes to enter into a contract to sell energy and capacity as a private power producer, an electric public service company, municipal electric energy cooperative or municipal electric utility shall respond promptly to all requests and offers and negotiate in good faith to arrive at a contract which fairly reflects the provisions of this section and the anticipated avoided costs over the life of the contract. Upon application by a private power producer, the authority may approve a contract which provides for payment of less than the anticipated avoided costs if, considering all of the provisions, the contract is at least as favorable to the private power producer as a contract providing for the full avoided costs. The contract may extend for a period of not more than thirty years at the option of the private power producer if it has a generating facility with a capacity of at least one hundred kilowatts.",
              "(e) The authority shall consider generating capacity available from cogeneration technology and renewable energy resources in its periodic reviews of electric public service companies and shall require the companies to include the availability of such capacity in applications for rate relief filed in accordance with section 16-19a .",
              "(f) If a private power producer believes that an electric distribution company has violated any provision of this section it may submit a written petition alleging such violation to the authority. Upon receipt of the petition, the authority shall fix a time and place for a hearing and mail notice of the hearing to the parties in interest at least one week in advance. Upon the hearing, the authority may, if it finds the company has violated any such provision, prescribe the manner in which it shall comply.",
              "(g) After January 1, 1992, the authority shall approve each proposed contract submitted by a private power producer for a small renewable power project, with any modifications agreed to by the parties to the contract, if the filing meets the standards for exemption from the proposal process and for an approvable contract established pursuant to section 16-6b , and is consistent with the pricing schedules adopted pursuant to subsection (c) of this section. Nothing in this section shall preclude a modification of such a contract if the parties to the contract agree to the modification. Any such modification shall be approved by the authority. The authority shall reconsider each decision issued pursuant to this section between January 1, 1992, and June 29, 1993, regarding such contracts and shall make any modifications to each such decision necessary to ensure that each such decision conforms with the provisions of this section.",

The cost of the award shall be recoverable from federally mandated congestion charges. No such award may be made unless the projected reduction in federally mandated congestion charges attributed to the investment is greater than the amount of the award. Revenues from such award shall not be included in calculating the electric distribution company's earnings for the purpose of determining whether its rates are just and reasonable under sections 16-19 , 16-19a and 16-19e .",
              "(p) Sixty days after the Public Utilities Regulatory Authority issues a final decision approving long-term contracts pursuant to this section, the authority shall direct an electric distribution company to negotiate, in good faith, long-term contracts for the electric energy output of each of the generation projects selected and approved by the authority to provide capacity pursuant to this section, provided the rates paid for such electric energy output when added to the payments made pursuant to such capacity contracts shall be the project's cost of service plus a reasonable rate of return. The electric distribution company shall apply to the authority for approval of any such energy output contract. No such contract shall be effective unless approved by the authority. The authority may approve only such contracts it finds would reduce and stabilize the cost of electricity to Connecticut ratepayers. Such contract may not exceed the term of the capacity contract for such generation project."

Nothing in sections 16-1 , 16-32f , 16-50i , 16-50k , 16-50x , 16-243i to 16-243q , inclusive, 16-244c , 16-245d , 16-245m , 16-245n and 16-245z and section 21 of public act 05-1 of the June special session* shall limit the authority's ability to conduct requests for proposals, in addition to that in subsection (c) of this section, to reduce federally mandated congestion charges and to approve such proposals or otherwise to meet its responsibility under this title.\n\n(k) The authority shall hold a hearing that shall be conducted as a contested case, in accordance with the provisions of chapter 54, to investigate any impact on the financial condition of electric distribution companies of long-term contracts entered into pursuant to this section and to establish, before issuing a request for proposals in accordance with subsection (c) of this section, the methodology for compensating the companies for such impacts. The methodology for addressing such impacts shall be included in the request for proposals under subsection (c) of this section, if appropriate. If the authority determines that entering into such long-term contracts results in increased costs incurred by the electric distribution companies, the authority, annually, shall allow such costs to be recovered through rates or in such manner as the authority considers appropriate. The authority shall determine whether such costs shall be considered in the evaluation or selection of bids under this section.\n\n(l) An electric distribution company may not submit a proposal under this section on or after February 1, 2011. On or before January 1, 2010, the authority shall submit a report, in accordance with section 11-4a , to the joint standing committee of the General Assembly having cognizance of matters relating to energy with a recommendation as to whether the period during which such company may submit proposals under this section should be extended.\n\n(m) For purposes of subdivision (1) of subsection (c) of section 16-50p , there shall be a rebuttable presumption that there is a public benefit in building a facility, as defined in subdivision (1) of subsection (a) of section 16-50i , that has been approved by the Public Utilities Regulatory Authority pursuant to this section.\n\n(n) The aggregate electric generating capacity for all approved proposals by electric distribution companies pursuant to subsections (g) and (j) of this section may not exceed two hundred fifty megawatts of generating capacity state-wide. The authority shall give guiding preference in approving the amount of generation capacity in proposals from electric distribution companies to the approximate proportion of each company's service area load.\n\n(o) When the authority selects a bid pursuant to subdivisions (2) and (3) of subsection (c) of this section from a person other than an electric distribution company, the authority shall grant the electric distribution company that serves the area in which the subject grid-side distributed resource or new generation facility is to be located a one-time, nonrecurring award, for investments necessary to improve the electric distribution company's transmission and distribution system to accommodate such facilities, in accordance with the following: For a grid-side distributed resource or new generation facility that is operational (1) on or before January 1, 2010, twenty-five dollars per kilowatt, (2) on or before January 1, 2011, fifteen dollars per kilowatt, and (3) on or before January 1, 2012, five dollars per kilowatt. The cost of the award shall be recoverable from federally mandated congestion charges. No such award may be made unless the projected reduction in federally mandated congestion charges attributed to the investment is greater than the amount of the award. Revenues from such award shall not be included in calculating the electric distribution company's earnings for the purpose of determining whether its rates are just and reasonable under sections 16-19 , 16-19a and 16-19e .\n\n(p) Sixty days after the Public Utilities Regulatory Authority issues a final decision approving long-term contracts pursuant to this section, the authority shall direct an electric distribution company to negotiate, in good faith, long-term contracts for the electric energy output of each of the generation projects selected and approved by the authority to provide capacity pursuant to this section, provided the rates paid for such electric energy output when added to the payments made pursuant to such capacity contracts shall be the project's cost of service plus a reasonable rate of return. The electric distribution company shall apply to the authority for approval of any such energy output contract. No such contract shall be effective unless approved by the authority. The authority may approve only such contracts it finds would reduce and stabilize the cost of electricity to Connecticut ratepayers. Such contract may not exceed the term of the capacity contract for such generation project."

            "text": "(a)(1) On and after January 1, 2007, each electric distribution company providing standard service pursuant to section 16-244c and each electric supplier, as defined in section 16-1 , shall demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Public Utilities Regulatory Authority that not less than one per cent of the total output of such supplier or such standard service of an electric distribution company shall be obtained from Class III sources.\n\n(2) On and after January 1, 2008, not less than two per cent of the total output of any such supplier or such standard service of an electric distribution company shall, on demonstration satisfactory to the Public Utilities Regulatory Authority, be obtained from Class III sources. On or after January 1, 2009, not less than three per cent of the total output of any such supplier or such standard service of an electric distribution company shall, on demonstration satisfactory to the Public Utilities Regulatory Authority, be obtained from Class III sources.\n\n(3) On and after January 1, 2010, not less than four per cent of the total output of any such supplier or such standard service of an electric distribution company shall, on demonstration satisfactory to the Public Utilities Regulatory Authority, be obtained from Class III sources.\n\n(4) On and after January 1, 2022, until December 31, 2029, not less than five per cent of the total output of any such supplier or such standard service of an electric distribution company shall, on demonstration satisfactory to the Public Utilities Regulatory Authority, be obtained from Class III sources, except that with respect to any retail electric supply contract that was entered into or renewed on or after January 1, 2023, but prior to July 1, 2024, not less than four per cent of the total output of any such supplier with respect to such contract shall be obtained from Class III sources. Such exception shall be in effect on and after July 1, 2024, until January 1, 2026, or the date that any such contract is renewed, whichever is earlier.\n\n(5) Electric power obtained from customer-side distributed resources that does not meet air and water quality standards of the Department of Energy and Environmental Protection is not eligible for purposes of meeting the percentage standards in this section.\n\n(b) Except as provided in subsection (d) of this section, the Public Utilities Regulatory Authority shall assess each electric supplier and each electric distribution company that fails to meet the percentage standards of subsection (a) of this section a charge of up to five and five-tenths cents for each kilowatt hour of electricity that such supplier or company is deficient in meeting such percentage standards. Seventy-five per cent of such assessed charges shall be used in furtherance of the Conservation and Load Management Plan established in section 16-245m , and twenty-five per cent shall be deposited in the Clean Energy Fund established in section 16-245n , except that such seventy-five per cent of assessed charges with respect to an electric supplier shall be allocated among the Conservation and Load Management Plan of electric distribution companies in proportion to the amount of electricity such electric supplier provides to end use customers in the state using the facilities of each electric distribution company.\n\n(c) An electric supplier or electric distribution company may satisfy the requirements of this section by participating in a conservation and distributed resources trading program approved by the Public Utilities Regulatory Authority. Credits created by conservation and customer-side distributed resources shall be allocated to the person that conserved the electricity or installed the project for customer-side distributed resources to which the credit is attributable and to the Conservation and Load Management Plan. Such credits shall be made in the following manner: A minimum of twenty-five per cent of the credits shall be allocated to the person that conserved the electricity or installed the project for customer-side distributed resources to which the energy credit is attributable and the remainder of the credits shall be used in furtherance of the Conservation and Load Management Plan, based on a schedule created by the authority no later than January 1, 2007, and reviewed annually thereafter. The authority may, in a proceeding and for good cause shown, allocate a larger proportion of such credits to the person who conserved the electricity or installed the customer-side distributed resources. The authority shall consider the proportion of investment made by a ratepayer through various ratepayer-funded incentive programs and the resulting reduction in federally mandated congestion charges. The portion used in furtherance of the Conservation and Load Management Plan shall be used for measures that respond to energy demand and for peak reduction programs.\n\n(d) An electric distribution company providing standard service may contract with its wholesale suppliers to comply with the conservation and customer-side distributed resources standards set forth in subsection (a) of this section. The Public Utilities Regulatory Authority shall annually conduct a contested case, in accordance with the provisions of chapter 54, to determine whether the electric distribution company's wholesale suppliers met the conservation and distributed resources standards during the preceding year. Any such contract shall include a provision that requires such supplier to pay the electric distribution company in an amount of up to five and one-half cents per kilowatt hour if the wholesale supplier fails to comply with the conservation and distributed resources standards during the subject annual period. The electric distribution company shall immediately transfer seventy-five per cent of any payment received from the wholesale supplier for the failure to meet the conservation and distributed resources standards to the Conservation and Load Management Plan and twenty-five per cent to the Clean Energy Fund. Any payment made pursuant to this section shall not be considered revenue or income to the electric distribution company.\n\n(e) The Public Utilities Regulatory Authority shall conduct a contested proceeding to develop the administrative processes and program specifications that are necessary to implement a Class III sources conservation and distributed resources trading program. The proceeding shall include, but not be limited to, an examination of issues such as (1) the manner in which qualifying activities are certified, tracked and reported, (2) the manner in which Class III certificates are created, accounted for and transferred, (3) verification of the accuracy of conservation and customer-side distributed resources credits, (4) verification of the fact that resources or credits used to satisfy the requirement of this section have not been used to satisfy any other portfolio or similar requirement, (5) the manner in which credits created by conservation and customer-side distributed resources may best be allocated to maximize the impact of the trading program, and (6) setting such alternative payment amounts at a level that encourages development of conservation and customer-side distributed resources. The authority may retain the services of a third party entity with expertise in the development of energy efficiency trading or verification programs to assist in the development and operation of the program. The authority shall issue a decision no later than February 1, 2008."

The Public Utilities Regulatory Authority shall not issue any order that results in the extension of any in-service date or contractual arrangement made as a part of Project 100 or Project 150 beyond the termination date previously approved by the authority established by the contract, provided any party to such contract may provide a notice of termination in accordance with the terms of, and to the extent permitted under, its contract, except the authority shall grant, upon request, an extension of the latest of any such in-service date by (i) twelve months for any project located in a distressed municipality, as defined in section 32-9p , with a population of more than one hundred twenty-five thousand, and (ii) not more than thirty-six months for any project having a capacity of less than five megawatts, provided any such project (I) commences construction by April 30, 2015, and (II) the authority has provided previous approval of such contract. The cost of such contracts and the administrative costs for the procurement of such contracts directly incurred shall be eligible for inclusion in the adjustment to any subsequent rates for standard service, provided such contracts are for a period of time sufficient to provide financing for such projects, but not less than ten years, and are for projects which began operation on or after July 1, 2003. Except as provided in this subdivision, the amount from Class I renewable energy sources contracted under such contracts shall be applied to reduce the applicable Class I renewable energy source portfolio standards. For purposes of this subdivision, the authority's determination of the comparable wholesale market price for generation shall be based upon a reasonable estimate. On or before September 1, 2011, the authority, in consultation with the Office of Consumer Counsel and the Connecticut Green Bank, shall study the operation of such renewable energy contracts and report its findings and recommendations to the joint standing committee of the General Assembly having cognizance of matters relating to energy.\n\n(3) Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (b) of this section regarding an alternative standard service option, an electric distribution company providing transitional standard offer service, standard service, supplier of last resort service or back-up electric generation service in accordance with this section that has within its service territory a biomass facility that is a Class I renewable energy source and began operation after December 1, 2013, shall, not later than July 1, 2018, file with the Public Utilities Regulatory Authority for its approval a ten-year power purchase contract not to exceed nine cents per kilowatt hour for energy and renewable energy certificates with such facility for generation equivalent to seven and one-half megawatts of electric capacity. The costs incurred by an electric distribution company pursuant to this subdivision shall be recovered on a timely basis through a nonbypassable fully reconciling component of electric rates for all customers of such electric distribution company.\n\n(i) (1) As used in this section:\n\n(A) “Participating electric supplier” means an electric supplier that is licensed by the department to provide electric service, pursuant to this subsection, to residential or small commercial customers.\n\n(B) “Residential customer” means a customer who is eligible for standard service and who takes electric distribution-related service from an electric distribution company pursuant to a residential tariff.\n\n(C) “Small commercial customer” means a customer who is eligible for standard service and who takes electric distribution-related service from an electric distribution company pursuant to a small commercial tariff.\n\n(D) “Qualifying electric offer” means an offer to provide full requirements commodity electric service and all other generation-related service to a residential or small commercial customer at a fixed price per kilowatt hour for a term of no less than one year.\n\n(2) In the manner determined by the authority, residential or small commercial service customers (A) initiating new utility service, (B) reinitiating service following a change of residence or business location, (C) making an inquiry regarding their utility rates, or (D) seeking information regarding energy efficiency shall be offered the option to learn about their ability to enroll with a participating electric supplier. Customers expressing an interest to learn about their electric supply options shall be informed of the qualifying electric offers then available from participating electric suppliers. The electric distribution companies shall describe then available qualifying electric offers through a method reviewed and approved by the authority. The information conveyed to customers expressing an interest to learn about their electric supply options shall include, at a minimum, the price and term of the available electric supply option.

Such informational summary shall be developed by the authority and shall include, but not be limited to, the name of each licensed electric supplier, the state where the supplier is based, information on whether the supplier has active offerings for either residential or commercial and industrial consumers, the telephone number and Internet web site of the supplier, and information as to whether the supplier offers electric generation services from renewable energy sources in excess of the portfolio standards established pursuant to section 16-245a . The authority shall include pricing information in the informational summary to the extent the authority determines feasible. The authority shall post the informational summary in a conspicuous place on its Internet web site and provide electronic links to the Internet web site of each supplier. The authority shall update the informational summary on its Internet web site on at least a quarterly basis.\n\n(b) (1) On or before October 1, 2014, the authority shall redesign the rate board Internet web site to better enable customers to compare pricing policies and charges among electric suppliers. Such redesign shall (A) reflect the best practices of similar rate board Internet web sites in other states and the development of a process to remove an electric supplier's price listings from such Internet web site based on protocols established by the authority to ensure compliance with this chapter and to address customer complaints, and (B) emphasize (i) uniformity in how electric suppliers provide information for each category on the rate board Internet web site, (ii) ease of use by customers, and (iii) ease of selecting and purchasing a specific contract from an electric supplier shown on the rate board Internet web site.\n\n(2) On or before July 1, 2017, and every two years thereafter, the authority shall review the rate board Internet web site and make any improvements to ensure such Internet web site remains a progressive tool for customers to compare pricing policies and charges among electric suppliers."

Any hearing shall be conducted as a contested case in accordance with chapter 54.\n\n(4) After the authority has calculated the total value of stranded costs for all nuclear generation assets, the authority shall (A) reduce such amount by the net proceeds that are above book value realized by an electric distribution company from the sale of nonnuclear generation assets, (B) reduce such valuation to reflect the total net proceeds that are above book value realized by an electric distribution company from the sale of any nuclear generation assets pursuant to subsection (c) of section 16-244g , and (C) reduce such amount by the net proceeds that are above book value received by an electric distribution company for the sale or lease of any real property after July 1, 1998.\n\n(i) If any net proceeds described in subdivision (4) of subsection (h) of this section remain after the reduction in the calculation of nuclear generation assets pursuant to said subdivision (4) or are realized after said reduction is calculated, the additional amount of such net proceeds shall be netted against long-term contract costs described in subdivision (2) of subsection (f) of this section, and the competitive transition assessment shall be adjusted accordingly.\n\n(j) No electric distribution company shall be eligible to claim any stranded costs for a nuclear generation asset or for any generation-related regulatory asset related to such generation asset, if the generation asset is not operating as a result of an order issued by the United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission that applies specifically to such asset. Any such asset that is not eligible to be claimed as a stranded cost shall be eligible after it is permitted to and has resumed operation and is selling power.\n\n(k) If an electric distribution company elected to transfer any of its nuclear generation assets and related operations and functions to a separate corporate affiliate or to a division that is functionally separate from the electric distribution company pursuant to section 16-244g and subsequently sold any such assets in an arm's length transaction to an unrelated entity prior to January 1, 2012, the net proceeds realized from such sale that exceed book value for such assets shall be netted against the total amount of stranded costs, and the competitive transition assessment shall be adjusted accordingly and, if appropriate, other reimbursement shall be ordered by the authority."

            "text": "(a) The competitive transition assessment described in subparagraph (A) of subdivision (2) of subsection (a) of section 16-245e shall constitute transition property when, and to the extent that, a financing order authorizing such portion of the competitive transition assessment has become effective in accordance with sections 16-245e to 16-245k , inclusive, and the transition property shall thereafter continuously exist as property for all purposes with all of the rights and privileges of sections 16-245e to 16-245k , inclusive, for the period and to the extent provided in the financing order, but in any event until the rate reduction bonds are paid in full, including all principal, interest, premium, costs, and arrearages on such bonds. Prior to its sale or other transfer by the electric distribution company pursuant to sections 16-245e to 16-245k , inclusive, transition property, other than transition property in respect of the economic recovery transfer or in respect to disbursements to the General Fund to sustain funding of conservation and load management and renewable energy investment programs, shall be a vested contract right of the electric distribution company, notwithstanding any contrary treatment thereof for accounting, tax, or other purpose. Transition property in respect of disbursements to the General Fund to sustain funding of conservation and load management and renewable energy investment programs shall immediately upon its creation vest solely in the financing entity. Transition property in respect to the economic recovery transfer shall immediately upon its creation vest solely in the financing entity. The electric distribution company shall have no right, title or interest in transition property in respect to the economic recovery transfer or in respect of disbursements to the General Fund to sustain funding of conservation and load management and renewable energy investment programs, and in respect of such transition property shall be only a collection agent on behalf of the financing entity.\n\n(b) Any surplus competitive transition assessment described in subparagraph (A) of subdivision (2) of subsection (a) of section 16-245e in excess of the amounts necessary to pay principal, premium, if any, interest and expenses of the issuance of the rate reduction bonds shall be remitted to the financing entity and may be used to benefit customers if this would not result in a recharacterization of the tax, accounting, and other intended characteristics of the financing, including, but not limited to, the following:\n\n(1) Avoiding the recognition of debt on the electric distribution company's balance sheet for financial accounting and regulatory purposes;\n\n(2) Treating the rate reduction bonds as debt of the electric distribution company or its affiliates for federal income tax purposes;\n\n(3) Treating the transfer of the transition property by the electric distribution company as a true sale for bankruptcy purposes; or\n\n(4) Avoiding any adverse impact of the financing on the credit rating of the rate reduction bonds or the electric distribution company.\n\n(c) Electric distribution companies may sell and assign all or portions of their interest in transition property to an affiliate. Electric distribution companies or their affiliates may sell or assign their interests to one or more financing entities that make that property the basis for issuance of rate reduction bonds to the extent approved in the pertinent financing orders. Electric distribution companies, their affiliates, or financing entities may pledge transition property as collateral, directly or indirectly, for rate reduction bonds to the extent approved in the pertinent financing orders providing for a security interest in the transition property, in the manner as set forth in section 16-245k . In addition, transition property may be sold or assigned by (1) the financing entity or a trustee for the holders of rate reduction bonds in connection with the exercise of remedies upon a default, or (2) any person acquiring the transition property after a sale or assignment pursuant to this subsection.\n\n(d) To the extent that any interest in transition property is so sold or assigned, or is so pledged as collateral, the authority shall authorize the electric distribution company to contract with the financing entity that it will continue to operate its system to provide service to its customers, will collect amounts in respect of the competitive transition assessment for the benefit and account of the financing entity, and will account for and remit these amounts to or for the account of the financing entity. Contracting with the financing entity in accordance with that authorization shall not impair or negate the characterization of the sale, assignment, or pledge as an absolute transfer, a true sale, or security interest, as applicable."

All rate reduction bonds shall contain on the face thereof a statement to the following effect: “Neither the full faith and credit nor the taxing power of the State of Connecticut is pledged to the payment of the principal of, or interest on, this bond.”\n\n(2) The issuance of rate reduction bonds under sections 16-245e to 16-245k , inclusive, shall not directly, indirectly, or contingently obligate the state or any political subdivision thereof to levy or to pledge any form of taxation therefor or to make any appropriation for their payment.\n\n(3) The exercise of the powers granted by sections 16-245e to 16-245k , inclusive, shall be in all respects for the benefit of the people of this state, for the increase of their commerce, welfare, and prosperity, and as the exercise of such powers shall constitute the performance of an essential public function, neither the finance authority, any electric distribution company, any affiliate of any electric distribution company, any financing entity, or any collection or other agent of any of the foregoing shall be required to pay any taxes or assessments upon or in respect of any revenues or property received, acquired, transferred, or used by the finance authority, any electric distribution company, any affiliate of any electric distribution company, any financing entity, or any collection or other agent of any of the foregoing under the provisions of sections 16-245e to 16-245k , inclusive, or upon or in respect of the income therefrom, and any rate reduction bonds shall be treated as issued by or on behalf of a public instrumentality created under the laws of the state for purposes of chapter 229.\n\n(4) (A) The proceeds of any rate reduction bonds, other than economic recovery revenue bonds, shall be used for the purposes approved by the authority in the financing order, including, but not limited to, disbursements to the General Fund in substitution for such disbursements in furtherance of the Conservation and Load Management Plan established by section 16-245m and from the Clean Energy Fund established by section 16-245n , the costs of refinancing or retiring of debt of the electric distribution company, and associated federal and state tax liabilities; provided such proceeds shall not be applied to purchase generation assets or to purchase or redeem stock or to pay dividends to shareholders or operating expenses other than taxes resulting from the receipt of such proceeds.\n\n(B) The proceeds of any economic recovery revenue bonds shall be used for the purposes approved by the authority in the financing order, including, but not limited to, funding the economic recovery transfer, provided such proceeds shall not be applied to purchase generation assets or to purchase or redeem stock or to pay dividends to shareholders or operating expenses other than taxes resulting from the receipt of such proceeds.\n\n(5) Rate reduction bonds are made and declared (A) securities in which all public officers and public bodies of the state and its political subdivisions, all insurance companies, state banks and trust companies, national banking associations, savings banks, savings and loan associations, investment companies, executors, administrators, trustees and other fiduciaries may properly and legally invest funds, including capital in their control or belonging to them, and (B) securities which may properly and legally be deposited with and received by any state or municipal officer or any agency or political subdivision of the state for any purpose for which the deposit of bonds or obligations of the state is now or may be authorized.\n\n(6) Rate reduction bonds, other than economic recovery revenue bonds, shall mature at such time or times approved by the authority in the financing order; provided that such maturity shall not be later than December 31, 2011. Economic recovery revenue bonds shall mature at such time or times approved by the authority in the financing order, provided such maturity shall not be later than eight years after the date of issuance, provided such maturity may be extended for economic reasons, upon the advice of the financing entity.\n\n(7) Rate reduction bonds issued and at any time outstanding may, if and to the extent permitted under the indenture or other agreement pursuant to which they are issued, be refunded by other rate reduction bonds.\n\n(d) Any rate reduction bonds issued or sold pursuant to or in reliance on and in accordance with any financing order issued by the authority pursuant to sections 16-245e to 16-245k , inclusive, shall be valid and binding in accordance with their terms notwithstanding such financing order is later vacated, modified, or otherwise held to be wholly or partly invalid, unless operation of such financing order has been enjoined, stayed, or suspended by the authority or a court of competent jurisdiction prior to such issuance.\n\n(e) In conjunction with the issuance of economic recovery revenue bonds or state rate reduction bonds: (1) The Treasurer may enter into a trust indenture for the benefit of holders of the rate reduction bonds with a corporate trustee, which may be any trust company or commercial bank qualified to do business within or without the state; such trust indenture shall be consistent with the financing order and may contain such other provisions as may be appropriate including those regulating the investment of funds and the remedies of bondholders; (2) the Treasurer may make representations and agreements for the benefit of the holders of rate reduction bonds to make secondary market disclosures; (3) the Treasurer may enter into interest rate swap agreements and other agreements for the purpose of moderating interest rate risk on rate reduction bonds as permitted elsewhere within sections 16-245e to 16-245k , inclusive, provided the obligations under such agreements are payable from the transition property; (4) the Treasurer may enter into such other agreements and instruments to secure the rate reduction bonds as provided in sections 16-245f to 16-245k , inclusive; and (5) the Treasurer may take such other actions as necessary or appropriate for the issuance and distribution of the rate reduction bonds pursuant to the financing order and the Treasurer and the Secretary of the Office of Policy and Management may make representations and agreements for the benefit of the holders of the rate reduction bonds which are necessary or appropriate to ensure exclusion of the interest payable on the rate reduction bonds from gross income under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, or any subsequent corresponding internal revenue code of the United States, as from time to time amended."

Any description of the transition property shall be sufficient if it refers to the financing order creating the transition property.

Subject to the terms of the security agreement, the pledgees of the transition property shall have a perfected security interest in all cash and deposit accounts of the electric distribution company in which revenues arising with respect to the transition property have been commingled with other funds, but the perfected security interest shall be limited to an amount not greater than the amount of the revenues with respect to the transition property received by the electric distribution company within twelve months before (1) any default under the security agreement, or (2) the institution of insolvency proceedings by or against the electric distribution company, less payments from the revenues to the pledgees during that twelve-month period.",

Unless otherwise ordered by the authority with respect to any series of rate reduction bonds on or prior to the issuance of the series, there shall exist a statutory lien as provided in this subsection. Upon the effective date of the financing order, there shall exist a first priority lien on all transition property then existing or thereafter arising pursuant to the terms of the financing order. This lien shall arise by operation of this section automatically without any action on the part of the electric distribution company, any affiliate thereof, the financing entity, or any other person. This lien shall secure all obligations, then existing or subsequently arising, to the holders of the rate reduction bonds issued pursuant to the financing order, the trustee or representative for the holders, and any other entity specified in the financing order. The persons for whose benefit this lien is established shall, upon the occurrence of any defaults specified in the financing order, have all rights and remedies of a secured party upon default under article 9 of title 42a, and shall be entitled to foreclose or otherwise enforce this statutory lien in the transition property. This lien shall attach to the transition property regardless of who shall own, or shall subsequently be determined to own, the transition property including any electric distribution company, any affiliate thereof, the financing entity, or any other person.

Financing statements so filed may be “protective filings” and shall not be evidence of the ownership of the transition property.

Conflicting liens shall rank according to priority in time of perfection. Transition property shall constitute property for all purposes, including for contracts securing rate reduction bonds, whether or not the revenues and proceeds arising with respect thereto have accrued.

Any order shall remain in full force and effect notwithstanding any bankruptcy, reorganization, or other insolvency proceedings with respect to the debtor, pledgor, or transferor of the transition property. Any surplus in excess of amounts necessary to pay principal, premium, if any, interest, costs, and arrearages on the rate reduction bonds, and other costs arising in connection with the documents governing the rate reduction bonds, shall be remitted to the debtor or to the pledgor or transferor.",

Granting to holders of rate reduction bonds a preferred right to revenues of the electric distribution company or the financing entity, or the provision by the company of other credit enhancement with respect to rate reduction bonds, shall not impair or negate the characterization of any transfer as a true sale, in each case notwithstanding any contrary treatment of such transfer for accounting, tax or other purposes.",

Any description of the transition property shall be sufficient if it refers to the financing order creating the transition property. A copy of the financing statement shall be filed by the assignee or the financing entity with the authority, and the authority may require the assignor or the assignee or the financing entity to make other filings with respect to the transfer in accordance with procedures it may establish, but these filings shall not affect the perfection of the transfer.",

Conflicting security interests shall rank according to priority in time of perfection. Transition property shall constitute property for all purposes, including for contracts securing rate reduction bonds, whether or not the revenues and proceeds arising with respect thereto have accrued.\n\n(d) Subject to the terms of the security agreement covering the transition property and the rights of any third parties holding security interests in the transition property perfected in the manner described in this section, the validity and relative priority of a security interest created under this section are not defeated or adversely affected by the commingling of revenues arising with respect to the transition property with other funds of the electric distribution company that is the pledgor or transferor of, or the collection agent with respect to, the transition property, or by any security interest in a deposit account of that electric distribution company into which the revenues are deposited or in such revenues themselves perfected under article 9 of title 42a or otherwise. Subject to the terms of the security agreement, the pledgees of the transition property shall have a perfected security interest in all cash and deposit accounts of the electric distribution company in which revenues arising with respect to the transition property have been commingled with other funds, but the perfected security interest shall be limited to an amount not greater than the amount of the revenues with respect to the transition property received by the electric distribution company within twelve months before (1) any default under the security agreement, or (2) the institution of insolvency proceedings by or against the electric distribution company, less payments from the revenues to the pledgees during that twelve-month period.\n\n(e) If an event of default occurs under the security agreement covering the transition property, the pledgees of the transition property, subject to the terms of the security agreement, shall have all rights and remedies of a secured party upon default under article 9 of title 42a, and shall be entitled to foreclose or otherwise enforce their security interest in the transition property, subject to the rights of any third parties holding prior security interests in the transition property perfected in the manner provided in this section.

Unless otherwise ordered by the authority with respect to any series of rate reduction bonds on or prior to the issuance of the series, there shall exist a statutory lien as provided in this subsection. Upon the effective date of the financing order, there shall exist a first priority lien on all transition property then existing or thereafter arising pursuant to the terms of the financing order. This lien shall arise by operation of this section automatically without any action on the part of the electric distribution company, any affiliate thereof, the financing entity, or any other person. This lien shall secure all obligations, then existing or subsequently arising, to the holders of the rate reduction bonds issued pursuant to the financing order, the trustee or representative for the holders, and any other entity specified in the financing order. The persons for whose benefit this lien is established shall, upon the occurrence of any defaults specified in the financing order, have all rights and remedies of a secured party upon default under article 9 of title 42a, and shall be entitled to foreclose or otherwise enforce this statutory lien in the transition property. This lien shall attach to the transition property regardless of who shall own, or shall subsequently be determined to own, the transition property including any electric distribution company, any affiliate thereof, the financing entity, or any other person. This lien shall be valid, perfected, and enforceable against the owner of the transition property and all third parties upon the effectiveness of the financing order without any further public notice; provided, however, that any person may, but shall not be required to, file a financing statement in accordance with subsection (b) of this section. Financing statements so filed may be “protective filings” and shall not be evidence of the ownership of the transition property.

Any order shall remain in full force and effect notwithstanding any bankruptcy, reorganization, or other insolvency proceedings with respect to the debtor, pledgor, or transferor of the transition property. Any surplus in excess of amounts necessary to pay principal, premium, if any, interest, costs, and arrearages on the rate reduction bonds, and other costs arising in connection with the documents governing the rate reduction bonds, shall be remitted to the debtor or to the pledgor or transferor.\n\n(h) A transfer of transition property by an electric distribution company to an affiliate or to a financing entity, or by an affiliate of an electric distribution company or a financing entity to another financing entity, which the parties have in the governing documentation expressly stated to be a sale or other absolute transfer, in a transaction approved in a financing order, shall be treated as an absolute transfer of all of the transferor's right, title, and interest, as in a true sale, and not as a pledge or other financing, of the transition property, in each case notwithstanding any contrary treatment of such transfer for accounting, tax, or other purposes. Granting to holders of rate reduction bonds a preferred right to revenues of the electric distribution company or the financing entity, or the provision by the company of other credit enhancement with respect to rate reduction bonds, shall not impair or negate the characterization of any transfer as a true sale, in each case notwithstanding any contrary treatment of such transfer for accounting, tax or other purposes.\n\n(i) A transfer of transition property shall be deemed perfected as against third persons when both of the following have taken place:\n\n(1) The authority has issued the financing order authorizing the competitive transition assessment included in the transition property.\n\n(2) An assignment of the transition property in writing has been executed and delivered to the transferee.\n\n(j) As between bona fide assignees of the same right for value without notice, the assignee first filing a financing statement in accordance with part 5 of article 9 of title 42a naming the assignor of the transition property as debtor and identifying the transition property has priority. In such case, the financing statement shall be filed as if the debtor were located in this state.

A copy of the financing statement shall be filed by the assignee or the financing entity with the authority, and the authority may require the assignor or the assignee or the financing entity to make other filings with respect to the transfer in accordance with procedures it may establish, but these filings shall not affect the perfection of the transfer.\n\n(k) Any successor to the electric distribution company, whether pursuant to any bankruptcy, reorganization, or other insolvency proceeding, or pursuant to any merger, sale, or transfer, by operation of law, or otherwise, shall perform and satisfy all obligations of the electric distribution company pursuant to sections 16-245e to 16-245k , inclusive, in the same manner and to the same extent as the electric distribution company, including, but not limited to, collecting and paying to the holders of rate reduction bonds or their representatives or the applicable financing entity revenues arising with respect to the transition property sold to the applicable financing entity or pledged to secure rate reduction bonds.\n\n(l) The authority of the Public Utilities Regulatory Authority to issue financing orders pursuant to sections 16-245e to 16-245k , inclusive, shall expire on December 31, 2008, with respect to bonds other than economic recovery revenue bonds.

              "(d) (1) Not later than November 1, 2012, and every three years thereafter, electric distribution companies, as defined in section 16-1 , in coordination with the gas companies, as defined in section 16-1 , shall submit to the Energy Conservation Management Board a combined electric and gas Conservation and Load Management Plan, in accordance with the provisions of this section, to implement cost-effective energy conservation programs, demand management and market transformation initiatives. All supply and conservation and load management options shall be evaluated and selected within an integrated supply and demand planning framework. Services provided under the plan shall be available to all customers of electric distribution companies and gas companies, provided a customer of an electric distribution company may not be denied such services based on the fuel such customer uses to heat such customer's home. The Energy Conservation Management Board shall advise and assist the electric distribution companies and gas companies in the development of such plan. The Energy Conservation Management Board shall approve the plan before transmitting it to the Commissioner of Energy and Environmental Protection for approval. The commissioner shall, in an uncontested proceeding during which the commissioner may hold a public meeting, approve, modify or reject said plan prepared pursuant to this subsection. Following approval by the commissioner, the board shall assist the companies in implementing the plan and collaborate with the Connecticut Green Bank to further the goals of the plan. Said plan shall include a detailed budget sufficient to fund all energy efficiency that is cost-effective or lower cost than acquisition of equivalent supply, and shall be reviewed and approved by the commissioner. The Public Utilities Regulatory Authority shall, not later than sixty days after the plan is approved by the commissioner, ensure that the balance of revenues required to fund such plan is provided through fully reconciling conservation adjustment mechanisms. Electric distribution companies shall collect a conservation adjustment mechanism that ensures the plan is fully funded by collecting an amount that is not more than the sum of six mills per kilowatt hour of electricity sold to each end use customer of an electric distribution company during the three years of any Conservation and Load Management Plan. The authority shall ensure that the revenues required to fund such plan with regard to gas companies are provided through a fully reconciling conservation adjustment mechanism for each gas company of not more than the equivalent of four and six-tenth cents per hundred cubic feet during the three years of any Conservation and Load Management Plan. Said plan shall include steps that would be needed to achieve the goal of weatherization of eighty per cent of the state's residential units by 2030 and to reduce energy consumption by 1.6 million MMBtu, or the equivalent megawatts of electricity, as defined in subdivision (4) of section 22a-197 , annually each year for calendar years commencing on and after January 1, 2020, up to and including calendar year 2025. Each program contained in the plan shall be reviewed by such companies and accepted, modified or rejected by the Energy Conservation Management Board prior to submission to the commissioner for approval. The Energy Conservation Management Board shall, as part of its review, examine opportunities to offer joint programs providing similar efficiency measures that save more than one fuel resource or otherwise to coordinate programs targeted at saving more than one fuel resource. Any costs for joint programs shall be allocated equitably among the conservation programs. The Energy Conservation Management Board shall give preference to projects that maximize the reduction of federally mandated congestion charges.",
              "(2) There shall be a joint committee of the Energy Conservation Management Board and the board of directors of the Connecticut Green Bank. The boards shall each appoint members to such joint committee. The joint committee shall examine opportunities to coordinate the programs and activities funded by the Clean Energy Fund pursuant to section 16-245n with the programs and activities contained in the plan developed under this subsection and to provide financing to increase the benefits of programs funded by the plan so as to reduce the long-term cost, environmental impacts and security risks of energy in the state. Such joint committee shall hold its first meeting on or before August 1, 2005.",
              "(3) Programs included in the plan developed under subdivision (1) of this subsection shall be screened through cost-effectiveness testing that compares the value and payback period of program benefits for all energy savings to program costs to ensure that programs are designed to obtain energy savings and system benefits, including mitigation of federally mandated congestion charges, whose value is greater than the costs of the programs. Program cost-effectiveness shall be reviewed by the Commissioner of Energy and Environmental Protection annually, or otherwise as is practicable, and shall incorporate the results of the evaluation process set forth in subdivision (4) of this subsection. If a program is determined to fail the cost-effectiveness test as part of the review process, it shall either be modified to meet the test or shall be terminated, unless it is integral to other programs that in combination are cost-effective. On or before March 1, 2005, and on or before March first annually thereafter, the board shall provide a report, in accordance with the provisions of section 11-4a , to the joint standing committees of the General Assembly having cognizance of matters relating to energy and the environment that documents (A) expenditures and fund balances and evaluates the cost-effectiveness of such programs conducted in the preceding year, and (B) the extent to and manner in which the programs of such board collaborated and cooperated with programs, established under section 7-233y , of municipal electric energy cooperatives. To maximize the reduction of federally mandated congestion charges, programs in the plan may allow for disproportionate allocations between the amount of contributions pursuant to this section by a certain rate class and the programs that benefit such a rate class. Before conducting such evaluation, the board shall consult with the board of directors of the Connecticut Green Bank. The report shall include a description of the activities undertaken during the reporting period.",
              "(4) The Commissioner of Energy and Environmental Protection shall adopt an independent, comprehensive program evaluation, measurement and verification process to ensure the Energy Conservation Management Board's programs are administered appropriately and efficiently, comply with statutory requirements, programs and measures are cost effective, evaluation reports are accurate and issued in a timely manner, evaluation results are appropriately and accurately taken into account in program development and implementation, and information necessary to meet any third-party evaluation requirements is provided. An annual schedule and budget for evaluations as determined by the board shall be included in the plan filed with the commissioner pursuant to subdivision (1) of this subsection. The electric distribution and gas company representatives and the representative of a municipal electric energy cooperative may not vote on board plans, budgets, recommendations, actions or decisions regarding such process or its program evaluations and their implementation. Program and measure evaluation, measurement and verification shall be conducted on an ongoing basis, with emphasis on impact and process evaluations, programs or measures that have not been studied, and those that account for a relatively high percentage of program spending. Evaluations shall use statistically valid monitoring and data collection techniques appropriate for the programs or measures being evaluated. All evaluations shall contain a description of any problems encountered in the process of the evaluation, including, but not limited to, data collection issues, and recommendations regarding addressing those problems in future evaluations. The board shall contract with one or more consultants not affiliated with the board members to act as an evaluation administrator, advising the board regarding development of a schedule and plans for evaluations and overseeing the program evaluation, measurement and verification process on behalf of the board. Consistent with board processes and approvals and the Commissioner of Energy and Environmental Protection's decisions regarding evaluation, such evaluation administrator shall implement the evaluation process by preparing requests for proposals and selecting evaluation contractors to perform program and measure evaluations and by facilitating communications between evaluation contractors and program administrators to ensure accurate and independent evaluations. In the evaluation administrator's discretion and at his or her request, the electric distribution and gas companies shall communicate with the evaluation administrator for purposes of data collection, vendor contract administration, and providing necessary factual information during the course of evaluations. The evaluation administrator shall bring unresolved administrative issues or problems that arise during the course of an evaluation to the board for resolution, but shall have sole authority regarding substantive and implementation decisions regarding any evaluation. Board members, including electric distribution and gas company representatives, may not communicate with an evaluation contractor about an ongoing evaluation except with the express permission of the evaluation administrator, which may only be granted if the administrator believes the communication will not compromise the independence of the evaluation. The evaluation administrator shall file evaluation reports with the board and with the Commissioner of Energy and Environmental Protection in its most recent uncontested proceeding pursuant to subdivision (1) of this subsection and the board shall post a copy of each report on its Internet web site. The board and its members, including electric distribution and gas company representatives, may file written comments regarding any evaluation with the commissioner or for posting on the board's Internet web site. Within fourteen days of the filing of any evaluation report, the commissioner, members of the board or other interested persons may request in writing, and the commissioner shall conduct, a transcribed technical meeting to review the methodology, results and recommendations of any evaluation. Participants in any such transcribed technical meeting shall include the evaluation administrator, the evaluation contractor and the Office of Consumer Counsel at its discretion. On or before November 1, 2011, and annually thereafter, the board shall report to the joint standing committee of the General Assembly having cognizance of matters relating to energy, with the results and recommendations of completed program evaluations.",
              "(5) Programs included in the plan developed under subdivision (1) of this subsection may include, but not be limited to: (A) Conservation and load management programs, including programs that benefit low-income individuals; (B) research, development and commercialization of products or processes which are more energy-efficient than those generally available; (C) development of markets for such products and processes; (D) support for energy use assessment, real-time monitoring systems, engineering studies and services related to new construction or major building renovation; (E) the design, manufacture, commercialization and purchase of energy-efficient appliances and heating, air conditioning and lighting devices; (F) program planning and evaluation; (G) indoor air quality programs relating to energy conservation; (H) joint fuel conservation initiatives programs targeted at reducing consumption of more than one fuel resource; (I) conservation of water resources; (J) public education regarding conservation; and (K) demand-side technology programs recommended by the Conservation and Load Management Plan. Support for such programs may be by direct funding, manufacturers' rebates, sale price and loan subsidies, leases and promotional and educational activities. The Energy Conservation Management Board shall periodically review contractors to determine whether they are qualified to conduct work related to such programs and to ensure that in making the selection of contractors to deliver programs, a fair and equitable process is followed. There shall be a rebuttable presumption that such contractors are deemed technically qualified if certified by the Building Performance Institute, Inc. or by an organization selected by the commissioner. The plan shall also provide for expenditures by the board for the retention of expert consultants and reasonable administrative costs provided such consultants shall not be employed by, or have any contractual relationship with, an electric distribution company or a gas company. Such costs shall not exceed five per cent of the total cost of the plan.",

The board shall also include two representatives selected by the gas companies. The members of the board shall serve for a period of five years and may be reappointed. Representatives of gas companies, electric distribution companies and the municipal electric energy cooperative shall be nonvoting members of the board. The members of the board shall elect a chairperson from its voting members. If any vote of the board results in an equal division of its voting members, such vote shall fail.\n\n(d) (1) Not later than November 1, 2012, and every three years thereafter, electric distribution companies, as defined in section 16-1 , in coordination with the gas companies, as defined in section 16-1 , shall submit to the Energy Conservation Management Board a combined electric and gas Conservation and Load Management Plan, in accordance with the provisions of this section, to implement cost-effective energy conservation programs, demand management and market transformation initiatives. All supply and conservation and load management options shall be evaluated and selected within an integrated supply and demand planning framework. Services provided under the plan shall be available to all customers of electric distribution companies and gas companies, provided a customer of an electric distribution company may not be denied such services based on the fuel such customer uses to heat such customer's home. The Energy Conservation Management Board shall advise and assist the electric distribution companies and gas companies in the development of such plan. The Energy Conservation Management Board shall approve the plan before transmitting it to the Commissioner of Energy and Environmental Protection for approval. The commissioner shall, in an uncontested proceeding during which the commissioner may hold a public meeting, approve, modify or reject said plan prepared pursuant to this subsection. Following approval by the commissioner, the board shall assist the companies in implementing the plan and collaborate with the Connecticut Green Bank to further the goals of the plan. Said plan shall include a detailed budget sufficient to fund all energy efficiency that is cost-effective or lower cost than acquisition of equivalent supply, and shall be reviewed and approved by the commissioner. The Public Utilities Regulatory Authority shall, not later than sixty days after the plan is approved by the commissioner, ensure that the balance of revenues required to fund such plan is provided through fully reconciling conservation adjustment mechanisms. Electric distribution companies shall collect a conservation adjustment mechanism that ensures the plan is fully funded by collecting an amount that is not more than the sum of six mills per kilowatt hour of electricity sold to each end use customer of an electric distribution company during the three years of any Conservation and Load Management Plan. The authority shall ensure that the revenues required to fund such plan with regard to gas companies are provided through a fully reconciling conservation adjustment mechanism for each gas company of not more than the equivalent of four and six-tenth cents per hundred cubic feet during the three years of any Conservation and Load Management Plan. Said plan shall include steps that would be needed to achieve the goal of weatherization of eighty per cent of the state's residential units by 2030 and to reduce energy consumption by 1.6 million MMBtu, or the equivalent megawatts of electricity, as defined in subdivision (4) of section 22a-197 , annually each year for calendar years commencing on and after January 1, 2020, up to and including calendar year 2025. Each program contained in the plan shall be reviewed by such companies and accepted, modified or rejected by the Energy Conservation Management Board prior to submission to the commissioner for approval. The Energy Conservation Management Board shall, as part of its review, examine opportunities to offer joint programs providing similar efficiency measures that save more than one fuel resource or otherwise to coordinate programs targeted at saving more than one fuel resource. Any costs for joint programs shall be allocated equitably among the conservation programs. The Energy Conservation Management Board shall give preference to projects that maximize the reduction of federally mandated congestion charges.\n\n(2) There shall be a joint committee of the Energy Conservation Management Board and the board of directors of the Connecticut Green Bank. The boards shall each appoint members to such joint committee. The joint committee shall examine opportunities to coordinate the programs and activities funded by the Clean Energy Fund pursuant to section 16-245n with the programs and activities contained in the plan developed under this subsection and to provide financing to increase the benefits of programs funded by the plan so as to reduce the long-term cost, environmental impacts and security risks of energy in the state. Such joint committee shall hold its first meeting on or before August 1, 2005.\n\n(3) Programs included in the plan developed under subdivision (1) of this subsection shall be screened through cost-effectiveness testing that compares the value and payback period of program benefits for all energy savings to program costs to ensure that programs are designed to obtain energy savings and system benefits, including mitigation of federally mandated congestion charges, whose value is greater than the costs of the programs. Program cost-effectiveness shall be reviewed by the Commissioner of Energy and Environmental Protection annually, or otherwise as is practicable, and shall incorporate the results of the evaluation process set forth in subdivision (4) of this subsection. If a program is determined to fail the cost-effectiveness test as part of the review process, it shall either be modified to meet the test or shall be terminated, unless it is integral to other programs that in combination are cost-effective. On or before March 1, 2005, and on or before March first annually thereafter, the board shall provide a report, in accordance with the provisions of section 11-4a , to the joint standing committees of the General Assembly having cognizance of matters relating to energy and the environment that documents (A) expenditures and fund balances and evaluates the cost-effectiveness of such programs conducted in the preceding year, and (B) the extent to and manner in which the programs of such board collaborated and cooperated with programs, established under section 7-233y , of municipal electric energy cooperatives. To maximize the reduction of federally mandated congestion charges, programs in the plan may allow for disproportionate allocations between the amount of contributions pursuant to this section by a certain rate class and the programs that benefit such a rate class. Before conducting such evaluation, the board shall consult with the board of directors of the Connecticut Green Bank. The report shall include a description of the activities undertaken during the reporting period.\n\n(4) The Commissioner of Energy and Environmental Protection shall adopt an independent, comprehensive program evaluation, measurement and verification process to ensure the Energy Conservation Management Board's programs are administered appropriately and efficiently, comply with statutory requirements, programs and measures are cost effective, evaluation reports are accurate and issued in a timely manner, evaluation results are appropriately and accurately taken into account in program development and implementation, and information necessary to meet any third-party evaluation requirements is provided. An annual schedule and budget for evaluations as determined by the board shall be included in the plan filed with the commissioner pursuant to subdivision (1) of this subsection. The electric distribution and gas company representatives and the representative of a municipal electric energy cooperative may not vote on board plans, budgets, recommendations, actions or decisions regarding such process or its program evaluations and their implementation. Program and measure evaluation, measurement and verification shall be conducted on an ongoing basis, with emphasis on impact and process evaluations, programs or measures that have not been studied, and those that account for a relatively high percentage of program spending. Evaluations shall use statistically valid monitoring and data collection techniques appropriate for the programs or measures being evaluated. All evaluations shall contain a description of any problems encountered in the process of the evaluation, including, but not limited to, data collection issues, and recommendations regarding addressing those problems in future evaluations. The board shall contract with one or more consultants not affiliated with the board members to act as an evaluation administrator, advising the board regarding development of a schedule and plans for evaluations and overseeing the program evaluation, measurement and verification process on behalf of the board. Consistent with board processes and approvals and the Commissioner of Energy and Environmental Protection's decisions regarding evaluation, such evaluation administrator shall implement the evaluation process by preparing requests for proposals and selecting evaluation contractors to perform program and measure evaluations and by facilitating communications between evaluation contractors and program administrators to ensure accurate and independent evaluations. In the evaluation administrator's discretion and at his or her request, the electric distribution and gas companies shall communicate with the evaluation administrator for purposes of data collection, vendor contract administration, and providing necessary factual information during the course of evaluations. The evaluation administrator shall bring unresolved administrative issues or problems that arise during the course of an evaluation to the board for resolution, but shall have sole authority regarding substantive and implementation decisions regarding any evaluation. Board members, including electric distribution and gas company representatives, may not communicate with an evaluation contractor about an ongoing evaluation except with the express permission of the evaluation administrator, which may only be granted if the administrator believes the communication will not compromise the independence of the evaluation. The evaluation administrator shall file evaluation reports with the board and with the Commissioner of Energy and Environmental Protection in its most recent uncontested proceeding pursuant to subdivision (1) of this subsection and the board shall post a copy of each report on its Internet web site. The board and its members, including electric distribution and gas company representatives, may file written comments regarding any evaluation with the commissioner or for posting on the board's Internet web site. Within fourteen days of the filing of any evaluation report, the commissioner, members of the board or other interested persons may request in writing, and the commissioner shall conduct, a transcribed technical meeting to review the methodology, results and recommendations of any evaluation. Participants in any such transcribed technical meeting shall include the evaluation administrator, the evaluation contractor and the Office of Consumer Counsel at its discretion. On or before November 1, 2011, and annually thereafter, the board shall report to the joint standing committee of the General Assembly having cognizance of matters relating to energy, with the results and recommendations of completed program evaluations.\n\n(5) Programs included in the plan developed under subdivision (1) of this subsection may include, but not be limited to: (A) Conservation and load management programs, including programs that benefit low-income individuals; (B) research, development and commercialization of products or processes which are more energy-efficient than those generally available; (C) development of markets for such products and processes; (D) support for energy use assessment, real-time monitoring systems, engineering studies and services related to new construction or major building renovation; (E) the design, manufacture, commercialization and purchase of energy-efficient appliances and heating, air conditioning and lighting devices; (F) program planning and evaluation; (G) indoor air quality programs relating to energy conservation; (H) joint fuel conservation initiatives programs targeted at reducing consumption of more than one fuel resource; (I) conservation of water resources; (J) public education regarding conservation; and (K) demand-side technology programs recommended by the Conservation and Load Management Plan. Support for such programs may be by direct funding, manufacturers' rebates, sale price and loan subsidies, leases and promotional and educational activities. The Energy Conservation Management Board shall periodically review contractors to determine whether they are qualified to conduct work related to such programs and to ensure that in making the selection of contractors to deliver programs, a fair and equitable process is followed. There shall be a rebuttable presumption that such contractors are deemed technically qualified if certified by the Building Performance Institute, Inc. or by an organization selected by the commissioner. The plan shall also provide for expenditures by the board for the retention of expert consultants and reasonable administrative costs provided such consultants shall not be employed by, or have any contractual relationship with, an electric distribution company or a gas company. Such costs shall not exceed five per cent of the total cost of the plan.\n\n(e) Deleted by P.A. 11-80 , S. 33.\n\n(f) Not later than December 31, 2006, and not later than December thirty-first every five years thereafter, the Energy Conservation Management Board shall, after consulting with the Connecticut Green Bank, conduct an evaluation of the performance of the programs and activities specified in the plan approved by the commissioner pursuant to subsection (d) of this section and submit a report, in accordance with the provisions of section 11-4a , of the evaluation to the joint standing committee of the General Assembly having cognizance of matters relating to energy.\n\n(g) Repealed by P.A. 06-186 , S. 91."

            "text": "(a) Not later than July 1, 2016, the Connecticut Green Bank shall negotiate and develop master purchase agreements with each electric distribution company. Each such agreement shall require the electric distribution company to purchase, annually, fifteen-year tranches of solar home renewable energy credits produced by qualifying residential solar photovoltaic systems. Each electric distribution company's annual obligation to purchase fifteen-year tranches of solar home renewable energy credits produced by qualifying residential solar photovoltaic systems begins on the date that the Public Utilities Regulatory Authority approves the master purchase agreement pursuant to subsection (e) of this section and the obligation to purchase additional fifteen-year tranches expires on December 31, 2022, or after the deployment of three hundred fifty megawatts of residential solar photovoltaic installation, in the aggregate, whichever occurs earlier.\n\n(b) Solar home renewable energy credits shall be owned by the Connecticut Green Bank, until transferred to an electric distribution company pursuant to a master purchase agreement in accordance with subsection (a) of this section. A solar home renewable energy credit shall have an effective life covering the year of its production and the following calendar year. The obligation of the electric distribution companies to purchase solar home renewable energy credits pursuant to the master purchase agreement shall be apportioned as follows: (1) In the service area of an electric distribution company that has a service area of not more than seventeen cities and towns, twenty per cent of the annual aggregate credits; and (2) in the service area of an electric distribution company that has a service area of eighteen or more cities and towns, eighty per cent of the annual aggregate credits.\n\n(c) Notwithstanding subdivision (1) of subsection (h) of section 16-244c , an electric distribution company may retire the solar home renewable energy credits it procures through the master purchase agreement to satisfy its obligation pursuant to section 16-245a or such company may resell such renewable energy credits, with the proceeds from resale to be netted against contract costs.\n\n(d) To develop a master purchase agreement, the Connecticut Green Bank and an electric distribution company shall negotiate in good faith the final terms of the draft master purchase agreement. Thirty days after the date negotiations commence, either the Connecticut Green Bank or an electric distribution company may initiate a docket proceeding before the Public Utilities Regulatory Authority to resolve any outstanding issues pertaining to the master purchase agreement.\n\n(e) Upon completion of negotiations on a master purchase agreement the Connecticut Green Bank and the electric distribution company shall, not later than January 1, 2017, and thereafter as applicable, jointly file, with the authority, an application for approval of the agreement by the authority. No such master purchase agreement may become effective without approval of the authority. The authority shall hold a contested case, in accordance with the provisions of chapter 54, to approve, reject or modify an application for approval of the master purchase agreement.\n\n(f) The purchase price of solar home renewable energy credits shall be determined by the Connecticut Green Bank, and such purchase price shall decline over time commensurate with the schedule of declining performance-based incentives and expected performance-based buydowns. Such purchase price shall not exceed the lesser of either (1) the price of small zero-emission renewable energy credit projects for the preceding year, or (2) five dollars less per renewable energy credit than the alternative compliance payment pursuant to subsection (k) of section 16-245 . Any solar project located on a property that contains or will contain any residence of a customer of an electric distribution company that is determined to meet the Connecticut Green Bank criteria as a residential dwelling for the residential solar investment program shall not be eligible for small zero-emission renewable energy credits pursuant to sections 16-244r and 16-244s or for low-emission renewable energy credits pursuant to section 16-244t .\n\n(g) The electric distribution companies' costs associated with complying with this section shall be recoverable on a timely basis through a fully reconciling, nonbypassable rate component. Nothing in this section shall preclude the resale or other disposition of energy or associated renewable energy credits purchased by an electric distribution company, provided the electric distribution company shall net the cost of payments made to projects under the master purchase agreement against the proceeds of the sale of energy or renewable energy credits and the difference shall be credited or charged to electric distribution company customers through a reconciling component of electric rates as determined by the authority that is nonbypassable when switching electric suppliers.\n\n(h) Each electric distribution company shall annually file with the authority an accounting of all costs and fees incurred by such electric distribution company while complying with the master purchase agreement.\n\n(i) Any certificates issued by the New England Power Pool Generation Information System for Class I renewable energy credits produced by a qualifying residential solar photovoltaic system after the electric distribution company obligation, pursuant to subsections (a) and (b) of this section, to purchase solar home renewable energy credits from such system expires shall be transferred from the Connecticut Green Bank to the electric distribution companies as follows: (1) In the service area of an electric distribution company that has a service area of not more than seventeen cities and towns, twenty per cent of such certificates; and (2) in the service area of an electric distribution company that has a service area of eighteen or more cities and towns, eighty per cent of such certificates. The electric distribution company shall either (A) resell such credits into the New England Power Pool Generation Information System renewable energy credit market, to be used by any electric supplier or electric distribution company to meet the requirements of section 16-245a , so long as the revenues from such sale are credited to the electric distribution company's customers, or (B) retain such certificates to meet such company's requirements under section 16-245a . In considering whether to sell or retain such certificates, the company shall select the option that is in the best interest of such company's ratepayers."

Such notes shall be paid from any revenues of said bank or other moneys available for such purposes and not otherwise pledged, or from the proceeds of sale of the bonds of said bank in anticipation of which they were issued. The notes shall be issued in the same manner as the bonds. Such notes and the resolution or resolutions authorizing the same may contain any provisions, conditions or limitations which a bond resolution of said bank may contain.",

Notwithstanding that such bonds, notes or other obligations may be payable from a special fund, they shall be deemed to be for all purposes negotiable instruments, subject only to the provisions of such bonds, notes or other obligations for registration.",

Such trust agreement or resolution providing for the issuance of such bonds may contain such provisions for protecting and enforcing the rights and remedies of the bondholders as may be reasonable and proper and not in violation of law, including such provisions as have been specifically authorized by this section to be included in any resolution of said bank authorizing bonds thereof. Any bank or trust company incorporated under the laws of this state, which may act as depositary of the proceeds of bonds or of revenues or other moneys, may furnish such indemnifying bonds or pledge such securities as may be required by said bank. Any such trust agreement or resolution may set forth the rights and remedies of the bondholders and of the trustee or trustees, and may restrict the individual right of action by bondholders. In addition to the foregoing, any such trust agreement or resolution may contain such other provisions as said bank may deem reasonable and proper for the security of the bondholders. All expenses incurred in carrying out the provisions of such trust agreement or resolution may be treated as a part of the cost of the operation of a project.",

All such bonds shall contain on the face thereof a statement to the effect that neither the state of Connecticut nor any political subdivision thereof, other than said bank, shall be obligated to pay the same or the interest thereon except from revenues of the project or the portion thereof for which such bonds are issued, and that neither the full faith and credit nor the taxing power of the state of Connecticut or of any political subdivision thereof, other than said bank, is pledged to the payment of the principal of or the interest on such bonds. The issuance of bonds under the provisions of this section shall not directly, indirectly or contingently obligate the state or any political subdivision thereof to levy or to pledge any form of taxation or to make any appropriation for the payment of such bonds. Nothing contained in this section shall prevent or be construed to prevent said bank from pledging its full faith and credit or the full faith and credit of any individual, partnership, corporation or association or other body, public or private, to the payment of bonds or issue of bonds authorized pursuant to this section.",
              "(j) The state of Connecticut does hereby pledge to and agree with the holders of any bonds, notes or other obligations issued under this section and with those parties who may enter into contracts with the Connecticut Green Bank or its successor agency pursuant to the provisions of this section that the state shall not limit or alter the rights hereby vested in said bank until such obligations, together with the interest thereon, are fully met and discharged and such contracts are fully performed on the part of said bank, provided nothing contained in this subsection shall preclude such limitation or alteration if and when adequate provision is made by law for the protection of the holders of such bonds, notes or other obligations of said bank or those entering into such contracts with said bank. Said bank is authorized to include this pledge and undertaking for the state in such bonds, notes or other obligations, or contracts.",

Such rates, rents, fees and charges shall be fixed and adjusted in respect of the aggregate of rates, rents, fees and charges from such project so as to provide funds sufficient with other revenues or moneys available for such purposes, if any, (A) to pay the cost of maintaining, repairing and operating the project and each and every portion thereof, to the extent that the payment of such cost has not otherwise been adequately provided for, (B) to pay the principal of and the interest on outstanding bonds of said bank issued in respect of such project as the same shall become due and payable, and (C) to create and maintain reserves required or provided for in any resolution authorizing, or trust agreement securing, such bonds of said bank. Such rates, rents, fees and charges shall not be subject to supervision or regulation by any department, commission, board, body, bureau or agency of this state other than said bank.",
              "(2) A sufficient amount of the revenues derived in respect of a project, except such part of such revenues as may be necessary to pay the cost of maintenance, repair and operation and to provide reserves and for renewals, replacements, extensions, enlargements and improvements as may be provided for in the resolution authorizing the issuance of any bonds of the Connecticut Green Bank or in the trust agreement securing the same, shall be set aside at such regular intervals as may be provided in such resolution or trust agreement in a sinking or other similar fund which is hereby pledged to, and charged with, the payment of the principal of and the interest on such bonds as the same shall become due, and the redemption price or the purchase price of bonds retired by call or purchase as therein provided. Such pledge shall be valid and binding from the time when the pledge is made. The rates, rents, fees and charges and other revenues or other moneys so pledged and thereafter received by said bank shall immediately be subject to the lien of such pledge without any physical delivery thereof or further act, and the lien of any such pledge shall be valid and binding as against all parties having claims of any kind in tort, contract or otherwise against said bank, irrespective of whether such parties have notice of such claims. Notwithstanding any provision of the Connecticut Uniform Commercial Code, neither the resolution nor any trust agreement nor any other agreement nor any lease by which a pledge is created need be filed or recorded except in the records of said bank. The use and disposition of moneys to the credit of such sinking or other similar fund shall be subject to the provisions of the resolution authorizing the issuance of such bonds or of such trust agreement. Except as may otherwise be provided in such resolution or such trust agreement, such sinking or other similar fund may be a fund for all such bonds issued to finance projects for any individual, partnership, corporation or association, or other body, public or private, without distinction or priority of one over another; provided said bank in any such resolution or trust agreement may provide that such sinking or other similar fund shall be the fund for a particular project for any individual, partnership, corporation or association, or other body, public or private, and for the bonds issued to finance a particular project and may, additionally, permit and provide for the issuance of bonds having a subordinate lien in respect of the security authorized by this subsection to other bonds of said bank, and, in such case, said bank may create separate sinking or other similar funds in respect of such subordinate lien bonds.",

Any officer with whom, or any bank or trust company with which, such moneys are deposited shall act as trustee of such moneys and shall hold and apply the same for the purposes of this section, subject to the resolution authorizing the bonds of any issue or the trust agreement securing such bonds.",

Any officer with whom, or any bank or trust company with which, such moneys shall be deposited as trustee thereof shall hold, invest, reinvest and apply such moneys for the purposes thereof, subject to such provisions as this section and the resolution authorizing the issue of the bonds or notes or the trust agreement securing such bonds or notes may provide.",
              "(o) The exercise of the powers granted by this section shall be in all respects for the benefit of the people of this state, for the increase of their commerce, welfare and prosperity, and for the improvement of their health and living conditions, and, as the exercise of such powers shall constitute the performance of an essential public function, neither the Connecticut Green Bank, any affiliate of said bank, nor any collection or other agent of said bank nor any such affiliate shall be required to pay any taxes or assessments upon or in respect of any revenues or property received, acquired, transferred or used by said bank, any affiliate of said bank or any collection or other agent of said bank or any such affiliate or upon or in respect of the income from such revenues or property.

            "text": "(a) The Connecticut Green Bank is authorized from time to time to issue its negotiable bonds for any corporate purpose. In anticipation of the sale of such bonds, the Connecticut Green Bank may issue negotiable bond anticipation notes and may renew the same from time to time. Such notes shall be paid from any revenues of said bank or other moneys available for such purposes and not otherwise pledged, or from the proceeds of sale of the bonds of said bank in anticipation of which they were issued. The notes shall be issued in the same manner as the bonds. Such notes and the resolution or resolutions authorizing the same may contain any provisions, conditions or limitations which a bond resolution of said bank may contain.\n\n(b) Every issue of the bonds, notes or other obligations issued by the Connecticut Green Bank shall be special obligations of said bank payable from any revenues or moneys of said bank available for such purposes and not otherwise pledged, subject to any agreements with the holders of particular bonds, notes or other obligations pledging any particular revenues or moneys, and subject to any agreements with any individual, partnership, corporation or association or other body, public or private. Notwithstanding that such bonds, notes or other obligations may be payable from a special fund, they shall be deemed to be for all purposes negotiable instruments, subject only to the provisions of such bonds, notes or other obligations for registration.\n\n(c) The bonds may be issued as serial bonds or as term bonds, or the Connecticut Green Bank, in its discretion, may issue bonds of both types. The bonds shall be authorized by resolution of the members of the board of directors of said bank and shall bear such date or dates, mature at such time or times, not exceeding twenty-five years for bonds issued for clean energy and fifty years for bonds issued for environmental infrastructure from their respective dates and in each case not to exceed the expected useful life of the underlying project or projects, bear interest at such rate or rates, be payable at such time or times, be in such denominations, be in such form, either coupon or registered, carry such registration privileges, be executed in such manner, be payable in lawful money of the United States at such place or places, and be subject to such terms of redemption, as such resolution or resolutions may provide. The bonds or notes may be sold at public or private sale for such price or prices as said bank shall determine. The power to fix the date of sale of bonds, to receive bids or proposals, to award and sell bonds, and to take all other necessary action to sell and deliver bonds may be delegated to the chairperson or vice-chairperson of the board, a subcommittee of the board or other officers of said bank by resolution of the board. The exercise of such delegated powers may be made subject to the approval of a majority of the members of the board which approval may be given in the manner provided in the bylaws of said bank. Pending preparation of the definitive bonds, said bank may issue interim receipts or certificates which shall be exchanged for such definitive bonds.\n\n(d) Any resolution or resolutions authorizing any bonds or any issue of bonds may contain provisions, which shall be a part of the contract with the holders of the bonds to be authorized, as to: (1) Pledges of the full faith and credit of the Connecticut Green Bank, the full faith and credit of any individual, partnership, corporation or association or other body, public or private, all or any part of the revenues of a project or any revenue-producing contract or contracts made by said bank with any individual, partnership, corporation or association or other body, public or private, any federally guaranteed security and moneys received therefrom purchased with bond proceeds or any other property, revenues, funds or legally available moneys to secure the payment of the bonds or of any particular issue of bonds, subject to such agreements with bondholders as may then exist; (2) the rentals, fees and other charges to be charged, and the amounts to be raised in each year thereby, and the use and disposition of the revenues; (3) the setting aside of reserves or sinking funds, and the regulation and disposition thereof; (4) limitations on the right of said bank or its agent to restrict and regulate the use of the project funded by such bonds or issue of bonds; (5) the purpose and limitations to which the proceeds of sale of any issue of bonds then or thereafter to be issued may be applied, including as authorized purposes all costs and expenses necessary or incidental to the issuance of bonds, to the acquisition of or commitment to acquire any federally guaranteed security and to the issuance and obtaining of any federally insured mortgage note, and pledging such proceeds to secure the payment of the bonds or any issue of the bonds; (6) limitations on the issuance of additional bonds, the terms upon which additional bonds may be issued and secured and the refunding of outstanding bonds; (7) the procedure, if any, by which the terms of any contract with bondholders may be amended or abrogated, the amount of bonds the holders of which must consent thereto, and the manner in which such consent may be given; (8) limitations on the amount of moneys derived from such project to be expended for operating, administrative or other expenses of said bank; (9) definitions of the acts or omissions to act which shall constitute a default in the duties of said bank to holders of its obligations and the rights and remedies of such holders in the event of a default; and (10) the mortgaging of a project and the site thereof for the purpose of securing the bondholders.\n\n(e) Neither the members of the board of directors of the Connecticut Green Bank nor any person executing the bonds, notes or other obligations shall be liable personally on the bonds, notes or other obligations or be subject to any personal liability or accountability by reason of the issuance thereof.\n\n(f) The Connecticut Green Bank shall have the power to purchase its bonds, notes or other obligations out of any funds available for such purposes. Said bank may hold, pledge, cancel or resell such bonds, notes or other obligations, subject to and in accordance with agreements with bondholders. Said bank may sell, transfer or assign any of its loan assets to a trustee or other third party for the purposes of providing security for its bonds, notes or other obligations, or for bonds, notes or other obligations issued by the trustee or other third party on its behalf.\n\n(g) The Connecticut Green Bank is further authorized and empowered to issue bonds, notes or other obligations under this section, the interest on which may be includable in the gross income of the holder or holders thereof under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, or any subsequent corresponding internal revenue code of the United States, as from time to time amended, to the same extent and in the same manner that interest on bills, notes, bonds or other obligations of the United States is includable in the gross income of the holder or holders thereof under said internal revenue code. Any such bonds, notes or other obligations may be issued only upon a finding by said bank that such issuance is necessary, is in the public interest, and is in furtherance of the purposes and powers of said bank. The state hereby consents to such inclusion only for the bonds, notes or other obligations of said bank so issued.\n\n(h) At the discretion of the Connecticut Green Bank, any bonds issued under the provisions of this section may be secured by a trust agreement by and between said bank and a corporate trustee or trustees, which may be any trust company or bank having the powers of a trust company within or without the state. Such trust agreement or the resolution providing for the issuance of such bonds or other instrument of said bank may secure such bonds by a pledge or assignment of any revenues to be received, any contract or proceeds of any contract, or any other property, revenues, moneys or funds available to said bank for such purpose. Any pledge made by said bank pursuant to this subsection shall be valid and binding from the time when the pledge is made. The lien of any such pledge shall be valid and binding as against all parties having claims of any kind in tort, contract or otherwise against said bank, irrespective of whether the parties have notice of the claims. Notwithstanding any provision of the Uniform Commercial Code, no instrument by which such pledge is created need be recorded or filed except in the records of said bank. Any revenues, contract or proceeds of any contract, or other property, revenues, moneys or funds so pledged and thereafter received by said bank shall be subject immediately to the lien of the pledge without any physical delivery thereof or further act, and such lien shall have priority over all other liens. Such trust agreement or resolution may mortgage, assign or convey any real property to secure such bonds. Such trust agreement or resolution providing for the issuance of such bonds may contain such provisions for protecting and enforcing the rights and remedies of the bondholders as may be reasonable and proper and not in violation of law, including such provisions as have been specifically authorized by this section to be included in any resolution of said bank authorizing bonds thereof. Any bank or trust company incorporated under the laws of this state, which may act as depositary of the proceeds of bonds or of revenues or other moneys, may furnish such indemnifying bonds or pledge such securities as may be required by said bank. Any such trust agreement or resolution may set forth the rights and remedies of the bondholders and of the trustee or trustees, and may restrict the individual right of action by bondholders. In addition to the foregoing, any such trust agreement or resolution may contain such other provisions as said bank may deem reasonable and proper for the security of the bondholders. All expenses incurred in carrying out the provisions of such trust agreement or resolution may be treated as a part of the cost of the operation of a project.\n\n(i) Bonds issued under the provisions of this section shall not be deemed to constitute a debt or liability of the state or of any political subdivision thereof, other than the Connecticut Green Bank, or a pledge of the full faith and credit of the state or any of its political subdivisions other than said bank, but shall be payable solely from the funds provided for such purposes by this section. All such bonds shall contain on the face thereof a statement to the effect that neither the state of Connecticut nor any political subdivision thereof, other than said bank, shall be obligated to pay the same or the interest thereon except from revenues of the project or the portion thereof for which such bonds are issued, and that neither the full faith and credit nor the taxing power of the state of Connecticut or of any political subdivision thereof, other than said bank, is pledged to the payment of the principal of or the interest on such bonds. The issuance of bonds under the provisions of this section shall not directly, indirectly or contingently obligate the state or any political subdivision thereof to levy or to pledge any form of taxation or to make any appropriation for the payment of such bonds. Nothing contained in this section shall prevent or be construed to prevent said bank from pledging its full faith and credit or the full faith and credit of any individual, partnership, corporation or association or other body, public or private, to the payment of bonds or issue of bonds authorized pursuant to this section.\n\n(j) The state of Connecticut does hereby pledge to and agree with the holders of any bonds, notes or other obligations issued under this section and with those parties who may enter into contracts with the Connecticut Green Bank or its successor agency pursuant to the provisions of this section that the state shall not limit or alter the rights hereby vested in said bank until such obligations, together with the interest thereon, are fully met and discharged and such contracts are fully performed on the part of said bank, provided nothing contained in this subsection shall preclude such limitation or alteration if and when adequate provision is made by law for the protection of the holders of such bonds, notes or other obligations of said bank or those entering into such contracts with said bank. Said bank is authorized to include this pledge and undertaking for the state in such bonds, notes or other obligations, or contracts.\n\n(k) (1) The Connecticut Green Bank is authorized to fix, revise, charge and collect rates, rents, fees and charges for the use of and for the services furnished or to be furnished by each project, and to contract with any individual, partnership, corporation or association, or other body, public or private, in respect thereof. Such rates, rents, fees and charges shall be fixed and adjusted in respect of the aggregate of rates, rents, fees and charges from such project so as to provide funds sufficient with other revenues or moneys available for such purposes, if any, (A) to pay the cost of maintaining, repairing and operating the project and each and every portion thereof, to the extent that the payment of such cost has not otherwise been adequately provided for, (B) to pay the principal of and the interest on outstanding bonds of said bank issued in respect of such project as the same shall become due and payable, and (C) to create and maintain reserves required or provided for in any resolution authorizing, or trust agreement securing, such bonds of said bank. Such rates, rents, fees and charges shall not be subject to supervision or regulation by any department, commission, board, body, bureau or agency of this state other than said bank.\n\n(2) A sufficient amount of the revenues derived in respect of a project, except such part of such revenues as may be necessary to pay the cost of maintenance, repair and operation and to provide reserves and for renewals, replacements, extensions, enlargements and improvements as may be provided for in the resolution authorizing the issuance of any bonds of the Connecticut Green Bank or in the trust agreement securing the same, shall be set aside at such regular intervals as may be provided in such resolution or trust agreement in a sinking or other similar fund which is hereby pledged to, and charged with, the payment of the principal of and the interest on such bonds as the same shall become due, and the redemption price or the purchase price of bonds retired by call or purchase as therein provided. Such pledge shall be valid and binding from the time when the pledge is made. The rates, rents, fees and charges and other revenues or other moneys so pledged and thereafter received by said bank shall immediately be subject to the lien of such pledge without any physical delivery thereof or further act, and the lien of any such pledge shall be valid and binding as against all parties having claims of any kind in tort, contract or otherwise against said bank, irrespective of whether such parties have notice of such claims. Notwithstanding any provision of the Connecticut Uniform Commercial Code, neither the resolution nor any trust agreement nor any other agreement nor any lease by which a pledge is created need be filed or recorded except in the records of said bank. The use and disposition of moneys to the credit of such sinking or other similar fund shall be subject to the provisions of the resolution authorizing the issuance of such bonds or of such trust agreement. Except as may otherwise be provided in such resolution or such trust agreement, such sinking or other similar fund may be a fund for all such bonds issued to finance projects for any individual, partnership, corporation or association, or other body, public or private, without distinction or priority of one over another; provided said bank in any such resolution or trust agreement may provide that such sinking or other similar fund shall be the fund for a particular project for any individual, partnership, corporation or association, or other body, public or private, and for the bonds issued to finance a particular project and may, additionally, permit and provide for the issuance of bonds having a subordinate lien in respect of the security authorized by this subsection to other bonds of said bank, and, in such case, said bank may create separate sinking or other similar funds in respect of such subordinate lien bonds.\n\n(l) All moneys received pursuant to the provisions of this section, whether as proceeds from the sale of bonds or as revenues, shall be deemed to be trust funds to be held and applied solely as provided in this section. Any officer with whom, or any bank or trust company with which, such moneys are deposited shall act as trustee of such moneys and shall hold and apply the same for the purposes of this section, subject to the resolution authorizing the bonds of any issue or the trust agreement securing such bonds.\n\n(m) Any holder of bonds, bond anticipation notes, other notes or other obligations issued under the provisions of this section, or any of the coupons appertaining thereto, and the trustee or trustees under any trust agreement, except to the extent the rights given by this section may be restricted by any resolution authorizing the issuance of, or any such trust agreement securing, such bonds, may, either at law or in equity, by suit, action, mandamus or other proceedings, protect and enforce any and all rights under the laws of the state or granted by this section or under such resolution or trust agreement, and may enforce and compel the performance of all duties required by this section or by such resolution or trust agreement to be performed by the Connecticut Green Bank or by any officer, employee or agent thereof, including the fixing, charging and collecting of the rates, rents, fees and charges authorized by this section and required by the provisions of such resolution or trust agreement to be fixed, established and collected.\n\n(n) The Connecticut Green Bank shall have power to contract with the holders of any of its bonds or notes as to the custody, collection, securing, investment and payment of any reserve funds of said bank, or of any moneys held in trust or otherwise for the payment of bonds or notes, and to carry out such contracts. Any officer with whom, or any bank or trust company with which, such moneys shall be deposited as trustee thereof shall hold, invest, reinvest and apply such moneys for the purposes thereof, subject to such provisions as this section and the resolution authorizing the issue of the bonds or notes or the trust agreement securing such bonds or notes may provide.\n\n(o) The exercise of the powers granted by this section shall be in all respects for the benefit of the people of this state, for the increase of their commerce, welfare and prosperity, and for the improvement of their health and living conditions, and, as the exercise of such powers shall constitute the performance of an essential public function, neither the Connecticut Green Bank, any affiliate of said bank, nor any collection or other agent of said bank nor any such affiliate shall be required to pay any taxes or assessments upon or in respect of any revenues or property received, acquired, transferred or used by said bank, any affiliate of said bank or any collection or other agent of said bank or any such affiliate or upon or in respect of the income from such revenues or property. Any bonds, notes or other obligations issued under the provisions of this section, their transfer and the income therefrom, including any profit made on the sale of such bonds, notes or other obligations, shall at all times be free from taxation of every kind by the state and by the municipalities and other political subdivisions in the state, except for estate and succession taxes. The interest on such bonds, notes or other obligations shall be included in the computation of any excise or franchise tax.\n\n(p) (1) The Connecticut Green Bank is hereby authorized to provide for the issuance of bonds of said bank for the purpose of refunding any bonds of said bank then outstanding, including the payment of any redemption premium thereon and any interest accrued or to accrue to the earliest or subsequent date of redemption, purchase or maturity of such bonds, and, if deemed advisable by said bank, for the additional purpose of paying all or any part of the cost of constructing and acquiring additions, improvements, extensions or enlargements of a project or any portion thereof.\n\n(2) The proceeds of any such bonds issued for the purpose of refunding outstanding bonds may, at the discretion of the Connecticut Green Bank, be applied to the purchase or retirement at maturity or redemption of such outstanding bonds either on their earliest or any subsequent redemption date or upon the purchase or at the maturity thereof and may, pending such application, be placed in escrow to be applied to such purchase or retirement at maturity or redemption on such date as may be determined by said bank.\n\n(3) Any such escrowed proceeds, pending such use, may be invested and reinvested in direct obligations of, or obligations unconditionally guaranteed by, the United States and certificates of deposit or time deposits secured by direct obligations of, or obligations unconditionally guaranteed by, the United States, or obligations of a state, a territory, or a possession of the United States, or any political subdivision of any of the foregoing, within the meaning of Section 103(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, or any subsequent corresponding internal revenue code of the United States, as amended from time to time, the full and timely payment of the principal of and interest on which are secured by an irrevocable deposit of direct obligations of the United States which, if the outstanding bonds are then rated by a nationally recognized rating agency, are rated in the highest rating category by such rating agency, maturing at such time or times as shall be appropriate to assure the prompt payment, as to principal, interest and redemption premium, if any, of the outstanding bonds to be so refunded. The interest, income and profits, if any, earned or realized on any such investment or reinvestment may also be applied to the payment of the outstanding bonds to be so refunded. After the terms of the escrow have been fully satisfied and carried out, any balance of such proceeds and interest, income and profits, if any, earned or realized on the investments or reinvestments thereof may be returned to the Connecticut Green Bank for use by it in any lawful manner.\n\n(4) The portion of the proceeds of any such bonds issued for the additional purpose of paying all or any part of the cost of constructing and acquiring additions, improvements, extensions or enlargements of a project or any portion thereof may be invested and reinvested as the provisions of this section and the resolution authorizing the issuance of such bonds or the trust agreement securing such bonds may provide. The interest, income and profits, if any, earned or realized on such investment or reinvestment may be applied to the payment of all or any part of such cost or may be used by the Connecticut Green Bank in any lawful manner.\n\n(5) All such bonds shall be subject to the provisions of this section in the same manner and to the same extent as other bonds issued pursuant to this section or section 16-245n , 16-245 ll or 16-245mm .\n\n(q) Bonds issued by the Connecticut Green Bank under the provisions of this section are hereby made securities in which all public officers and public bodies of the state and its political subdivisions, all insurance companies, state banks and trust companies, national banking associations, savings banks, savings and loan associations, investment companies, executors, administrators, trustees and other fiduciaries may properly and legally invest funds, including capital in their control or belonging to them. Such bonds are hereby made securities which may properly and legally be deposited with and received by any state or municipal officer or any agency or political subdivision of the state for any purpose for which the deposit of bonds or obligations of the state is now or may hereafter be authorized by law.\n\n(r) In conjunction with the issuance of the bonds, notes or other obligations, the Connecticut Green Bank may: (1) Make representations and agreements for the benefit of the holders of the bonds, notes or other obligations to make secondary market disclosures; (2) enter into interest rate swap agreements and other agreements for the purpose of moderating interest rate risk on the bonds, notes or other obligations; (3) enter into such other agreements and instruments to secure the bonds, notes or other obligations; and (4) take such other actions as necessary or appropriate for the issuance and distribution of the bonds, notes or other obligations and may make representations and agreements for the benefit of the holders of the bonds, notes or other obligations which are necessary or appropriate to ensure exclusion of the interest payable on the bonds, notes or other obligations from gross income under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, or any subsequent corresponding internal revenue code of the United States, as amended from time to time."

This subsection shall not preclude bond guarantees or enhancements as provided in subsection (d) of section 16-245n . All clean energy bonds shall contain on the face thereof a statement to the following effect: “Neither the full faith and credit nor the taxing power of the State of Connecticut is pledged to the payment of the principal of, or interest on, this bond.”\n\n(d) The exercise of the powers granted by this section and section 16-245n shall be in all respects for the benefit of the people of this state, for the increase of their commerce, welfare and prosperity, and as the exercise of such powers shall constitute the performance of an essential public function, neither the Connecticut Green Bank, any affiliate of said bank, nor any collection or other agent of said bank or any such affiliate shall be required to pay any taxes or assessments upon or in respect of any revenues or property received, acquired, transferred or used by said bank, any affiliate of said bank or any collection or other agent of said bank or any such affiliate, or upon or in respect of the income from such revenues or property. Any bonds, notes or other obligations issued under the provisions of this section, their transfer and the income therefrom, including any profit made on the sale of such bonds, notes or other obligations, shall at all times be free from taxation of every kind by the state and by the municipalities and other political subdivisions in the state except for estate and succession taxes. The interest on such bonds, notes and other obligations shall be included in the computation of any excise or franchise tax.\n\n(e) The proceeds of any clean energy bonds shall be used for the purposes of the Connecticut Green Bank in accordance with section 16-245n ."

Any telecommunications services, functions and unbundled network elements and any combination thereof shall be offered under tariff at rates, terms and conditions that do not unreasonably discriminate among actual and potential users and actual and potential providers of such local network services.\n\n(b) Each telephone company shall provide reasonable nondiscriminatory access and pricing to all telecommunications services, functions and unbundled network elements and any combination thereof necessary to provide telecommunications services to customers. The authority shall determine the rates that a telephone company charges for telecommunications services, functions and unbundled network elements and any combination thereof, that are necessary for the provision of telecommunications services. The rates for interconnection and unbundled network elements and any combination thereof shall be based on their respective forward looking long-run incremental costs, and shall be consistent with the provisions of 47 USC 252(d).\n\n(c) (1) The rate that a telephone company charges for a competitive or emerging competitive telecommunications service shall not be less than the sum of (A) the rate charged to another telecommunications company for a noncompetitive or emerging competitive local network service function used by that company to provide a competing telecommunications service, and (B) the applicable incremental costs of the telephone company.\n\n(2) On and after the date the authority certifies a telephone company's operations support systems interface pursuant to section 16-247n , the authority shall, upon petition, conduct a contested case proceeding to consider whether modification or removal of the pricing standard set forth in subdivision (1) of this subsection for a telecommunications service deemed competitive pursuant to section 16-247f is appropriate. Notwithstanding the provisions of subdivision (1) of this subsection, if the authority determines that such a modification or removal is appropriate and is consistent with the goals set forth in section 16-247a , the authority shall so modify or remove said pricing standard for such telecommunications service.\n\n(3) Prior to the date that the authority certifies a telephone company's operations support systems interface pursuant to section 16-247n , the authority may, upon petition, conduct a contested case proceeding to consider whether modification or removal of the pricing standard set forth in subdivision (1) of this subsection for a telecommunications service deemed competitive pursuant to section 16-247f is appropriate. Any petition filed pursuant to this subdivision shall specify the geographic area in which the applicant proposes to modify or remove such pricing standard. Notwithstanding the provisions of subdivision (1) of this subsection, if the authority determines that such modification or removal is appropriate, is consistent with the goals set forth in section 16-247a and facilities-based competition exists in the relevant geographic area, the authority shall so modify or remove said pricing standard for such telecommunications service. In determining whether facilities-based competition exists in the relevant geographic area, the authority shall consider:\n\n(A) The number, size and geographic distribution of other providers of service;\n\n(B) The availability of functionally equivalent services in the relevant geographic area at competitive rates, terms and conditions;\n\n(C) The financial viability of each company providing functionally equivalent services in the relevant geographic market;\n\n(D) The existence of barriers to entry into, or exit from, the relevant geographic market;\n\n(E) Other indicators of market power that the authority deems relevant, which may include, but not be limited to, market penetration and the extent to which the applicant can sustain the price for the service above the cost to the company of providing the service in the relevant geographic area;\n\n(F) The extent to which other telecommunications companies must rely upon the noncompetitive services of the applicant to provide their telecommunications services and carrier access rates charged by the applicant;\n\n(G) Other factors that may affect competition; and\n\n(H) Other factors that may affect the public interest.\n\n(d) A telephone company shall not use the revenues, expenses, costs, assets, liabilities or other resources derived from or associated with providing a noncompetitive service to subsidize the provision of competitive, emerging competitive or unregulated telecommunications services by such telephone company or any affiliate that is a certified telecommunications provider."

Unless reclassified pursuant to this section, any other service offered by a telephone company on or before July 1, 1994, shall be deemed a noncompetitive service, provided such initial classification shall not be a factual finding that such service is noncompetitive. Notwithstanding subdivision (3) of subsection (c) of section 16-247b , prior to January 1, 2010, a telephone company shall not obtain a waiver from the authority of the pricing standard set forth in subdivision (1) of subsection (c) of section 16-247b for any service reclassified as competitive pursuant to subdivision (2), (3) or (4) of this subsection.\n\n(c) On petition, on its own motion, or in conjunction with a tariff investigation conducted pursuant to subsection (f) of this section, after notice and hearing, and within ninety days of receipt of a petition or its motion or within the time period set forth in subsection (f) of this section, as applicable, the authority may reclassify a telecommunications service as competitive, emerging competitive or noncompetitive, in accordance with the degree of competition which exists for that service in the marketplace, provided (1) a competitive service shall not be reclassified as an emerging competitive service, and (2) the authority may extend the period (A) before the end of the ninety-day period and upon notifying all parties to the proceedings by thirty days, or (B) in accordance with the provisions of subsection (f) of this section, as applicable.\n\n(d) In determining whether to reclassify a telecommunications service, the authority shall consider:\n\n(1) The number, size and geographic distribution of certified telecommunications providers of the service, provided the authority shall not reclassify any service as competitive if such service is available only from a telephone company or an affiliate of a telephone company that is a certified telecommunications provider;\n\n(2) The availability of functionally equivalent services in the relevant geographic area at competitive rates, terms and conditions, including, but not limited to, services offered by certified telecommunications providers, providers of commercial mobile radio services, as defined in 47 CFR 20.3, voice over Internet protocol providers and other services provided by means of alternative technologies;\n\n(3) The existence of barriers to entry into, or exit from, the relevant market;\n\n(4) Other factors that may affect competition; and\n\n(5) Other factors that may affect the public interest.\n\n(e) Except for those tariffs for services offered or provided to business retail end users for which a certified telecommunications provider or a telephone company elects to be exempt from filing or maintaining pursuant to subsection (h) of this section, each certified telecommunications provider and each telephone company shall file with the authority a new or amended tariff for each competitive or emerging competitive intrastate telecommunications service authorized pursuant to section 16-247c . A tariff for a competitive service shall be effective on five days' written notice to the authority. A tariff for an emerging competitive service shall be effective on twenty-one days' written notice to the authority. A tariff filing for a competitive or emerging competitive service shall include (1) rates and charges which may consist of a maximum rate and a minimum rate, (2) applicable terms and conditions, (3) a statement of how the tariff will benefit the public interest, and (4) any additional information required by the authority. A telephone company filing a tariff pursuant to this section shall include in said tariff filing the information set forth in subdivisions (1) to (4), inclusive, of this subsection, a complete explanation of how the company is complying with the provisions of section 16-247b and, in a tariff filing which declares a new service to be competitive or emerging competitive, a statement addressing the considerations set forth in subsection (d) of this section. If the authority approves a tariff which consists of a minimum rate and a maximum rate, the certified telecommunications provider or telephone company may amend its rates upon five days' written notice to the authority and any notice to customers which the authority may require, provided the amended rates are not greater than the approved maximum rate and not less than the approved minimum rate. A promotional offering for a previously approved competitive or emerging competitive tariffed service or a service deemed competitive pursuant to this section shall be effective on three business days' written notice to the authority.\n\n(f) On petition or its own motion, the authority may investigate a tariff or any portion of a tariff, which investigation may include a hearing. The authority may suspend a tariff or any portion of a tariff during such investigation. The investigation may include, but is not limited to, an inquiry to determine whether the tariff is predatory, deceptive, anticompetitive or violates the pricing standard set forth in subdivision (1) of subsection (c) of section 16-247b . Not later than seventy-five days after the effective date of the tariff, unless the party filing the tariff, all statutory parties to the proceeding and the authority agree to a specific extension of time, the authority shall issue its decision, including whether to approve, modify or deny the tariff. If the authority determines that a tariff filed as a new service is, in fact, a reclassification of an existing service, the authority shall review the tariff filing as a petition for reclassification in accordance with the provisions of subsection (c) of this section.\n\n(g) The provisions of this section shall not prohibit the authority from ordering different tariff filing procedures or effective dates for an emerging competitive service, pursuant to a plan for an alternative form of regulation of a telephone company approved by the authority in accordance with the provisions of section 16-247k .\n\n(h) On and after July 1, 2016, any certified telecommunications provider or telephone company may, upon written notice to the authority, elect to be exempt from any requirement to file or maintain with the authority any tariff for services offered or provided to business retail end users. A certified telecommunications provider or telephone company that elects to be exempt from the requirement to file or maintain with the authority any tariff for services offered or provided to business retail end users shall make the rates, terms and conditions for such services available to business retail end users in a clear and conspicuous manner, that is apparent to the reasonable business retail end user, either (1) in a customer service guide, (2) on such certified telecommunications provider's or telephone company's Internet web site, or (3) in a contract between such business retail end user and such certified telecommunications provider or telephone company."

From November first to May first, inclusive, no gas company and no municipal utility furnishing gas shall terminate, deny or refuse to reinstate residential gas service in hardship cases where the customer uses such gas for heat and lacks the financial resources to pay his or her entire account, except a gas company that, between May second and October thirty-first, terminated gas service to a residential customer who uses gas for heat and who, during the previous period of November first to May first, had gas service maintained because of hardship status, may refuse to reinstate the gas service from November first to May first, inclusive, only if the customer has failed to pay, since the preceding November first, the lesser of: (A) Twenty per cent of the outstanding principal balance owed the gas company as of the date of termination, (B) one hundred dollars, or (C) the minimum payments due under the customer's amortization agreement. Notwithstanding any provision of the general statutes, no electric distribution or gas company, no electric supplier and no municipal utility furnishing electricity or gas shall terminate, deny or refuse to reinstate residential electric or gas service where the customer lacks the financial resources to pay his or her entire account and if the termination, denial of or failure to reinstate such service would create a life-threatening situation for such customer or a member of such customer's household.

Such amortization agreement shall allow such customer adequate opportunity to apply for and receive the benefits of any available energy assistance program. An amortization agreement shall be subject to amendment on customer request if there is a change in the customer's financial circumstances.\n\n(3) As used in this section, (A) “household income” means the combined income over a twelve-month period of the customer and all adults, except children of the customer, who are and have been members of the household for six months or more, and (B) “hardship case” includes, but is not limited to: (i) A customer receiving local, state or federal public assistance; (ii) a customer whose sole source of financial support is Social Security, United States Department of Veterans Affairs or unemployment compensation benefits; (iii) a customer who is head of the household and is unemployed, and the household income is less than three hundred per cent of the poverty level determined by the federal government; (iv) a customer who is seriously ill or who has a household member who is seriously ill; (v) a customer whose income falls below one hundred twenty-five per cent of the poverty level determined by the federal government; and (vi) a customer whose circumstances threaten a deprivation of food and the necessities of life for himself or dependent children if payment of a delinquent bill is required.\n\n(4) (A) Each gas company and electric distribution company shall deduct an arrearage from the account of a residential customer of such company if the customer (i) meets the income eligibility requirements of the Connecticut energy assistance program or state appropriated fuel assistance program; (ii) authorizes the gas or electric distribution company to send a copy of the customer's monthly bill directly to any energy assistance agency for payment; (iii) enters into and complies with an amortization agreement, which agreement is consistent with decisions and policies of the Public Utilities Regulatory Authority; and (iv) is eligible for financial hardship programs with the gas or electric distribution company.

The authority may deny all or part of the recovery of costs incurred pursuant to this subsection if it determines that the company seeking recovery has been imprudent, inefficient or acting in violation of statutes or regulations regarding amortization agreements.\n\n(5) (A) All electric distribution and gas companies, electric suppliers and municipal utilities furnishing electricity or gas shall collaborate in developing, subject to approval by the Public Utilities Regulatory Authority, standard provisions for the notice of delinquency and impending termination under subsection (a) of section 16-262d . Each such company and utility shall place on the front of such notice a provision that the company, electric supplier or utility shall not effect termination of service to a residential dwelling for nonpayment of disputed bills during the pendency of any complaint.

(B) At the beginning of any discussion with a customer concerning a reasonable amortization agreement, any such company or utility shall inform the customer (i) of the availability of a process for resolving disputes over what constitutes a reasonable amortization agreement, (ii) that the company, electric supplier or utility will refer such a dispute to one of its review officers as the first step in attempting to resolve the dispute, and (iii) that the company, electric supplier or utility shall not effect termination of service to a residential dwelling for nonpayment of a delinquent account during the pendency of any complaint, investigation, hearing or appeal initiated by the customer, unless the customer fails to pay undisputed bills, or undisputed portions of bills, for service received during such period. (C) Each such company, electric supplier and utility shall inform and counsel all customers who are hardship cases as to the availability of all public and private energy conservation programs, including programs sponsored or subsidized by such companies and utilities, eligibility criteria, where to apply, and the circumstances under which such programs are available without cost.\n\n(6) The Public Utilities Regulatory Authority shall adopt regulations in accordance with the provisions of chapter 54 to carry out the provisions of this subsection. Such regulations shall include, but not be limited to, criteria for determining hardship cases and for reasonable amortization agreements, including appeal of such agreements, for categories of customers. Such regulations may include the establishment of a reasonable rate of interest that a company may charge on the unpaid balance of a customer's delinquent bill and a description of the relationship and responsibilities of electric suppliers to customers.\n\n(7) The Public Utilities Regulatory Authority may find that a reasonable amortization agreement, other than a reasonable amortization agreement under subdivision (4) of this subsection, is a period of not more than thirty-six months, unless the authority determines that a longer period is warranted. Not later than October 1, 2024, the authority shall amend any regulations adopted pursuant to subdivision (6) of this subsection to carry out the provisions of this subsection.\n\n(8) The chairperson of the Public Utilities Regulatory Authority may distribute not more than one million dollars in total each year to organizations or individuals providing legal services with the express purpose of attaining participation in public service company programs designed to assist customers with utility bill or arrearage payments, including negotiating a reasonable amortization agreement pursuant to this subsection. Any funds distributed pursuant to this subdivision shall be paid by all public service companies, in proportion to such companies' annual load and the amount of services provided to end use customers or revenue, as determined by the authority.\n\n(c) Each electric distribution and gas company, electric supplier and municipal utility shall, not later than December first, annually, submit a report to the authority and the General Assembly indicating (1) the number of customers in each of the following categories and the total delinquent balances for such customers as of the preceding May first: (A) Customers who are hardship cases and (i) who made arrangements for reasonable amortization agreements, (ii) who did not make such arrangements, and (B) customers who are nonhardship cases and who made arrangements for reasonable amortization, (2) (A) the number of heating customers receiving energy assistance during the preceding heating season and the total amount of such assistance, and (B) the total balance of the accounts of such customers after all energy assistance is applied to the accounts, (3) the number of hardship cases reinstated between November first of the preceding year and May first of the same year, the number of hardship cases terminated between May first of the same year and November first and the number of hardship cases reinstated during each month from May to November, inclusive, of the same year, (4) the number of reasonable amortization agreements executed and the number breached during the same year by (A) hardship cases, and (B) nonhardship cases, and (5) the number of accounts of (A) hardship cases, and (B) nonhardship cases for which part or all of the outstanding balance is written off as uncollectible during the preceding year and the total amount of such uncollectibles.\n\n(d) Nothing in this section shall (1) prohibit a public service company, electric supplier or municipal utility from terminating residential utility service upon request of the customer or in accordance with section 16-262d upon default by the customer on an amortization agreement or collecting delinquent accounts through legal processes, including the processes authorized by section 16-262f , or (2) relieve such company, electric supplier or municipal utility of its responsibilities set forth in sections 16-262d and 16-262e to occupants of residential dwellings or, with respect to a public service company or electric supplier, the responsibilities set forth in section 19a-109 .\n\n(e) No provision of the Freedom of Information Act, as defined in section 1-200 , shall be construed to require or permit a municipal utility furnishing electric, gas or water service, a municipality furnishing water or sewer service, a district established by special act or pursuant to chapter 105 and furnishing water or sewer service or a regional authority established by special act to furnish water or sewer service to disclose records under the Freedom of Information Act, as defined in section 1-200 , which identify or could lead to identification of the utility usage or billing information of individual customers, to the extent such disclosure would constitute an invasion of privacy. Nothing in this section prohibits the disclosure of delinquencies or enforcement actions.\n\n(f) If an electric supplier suffers a loss of revenue by operation of this section, the supplier may make a claim for such revenue to the authority. The electric distribution company shall reimburse the electric supplier for such losses found to be reasonable by the authority at the lower of (1) the price of the contract between the supplier and the customer, or (2) the electric distribution company's price to customers for default service, as determined by the authority. The electric distribution company may recover such reimbursement, along with transaction costs, through the systems benefits charge."

              "(a) The Public Utilities Regulatory Authority, in consultation with the Department of Public Health, upon a determination that the costs of improvements to and the acquisition of the water company are necessary and reasonable, shall order the acquisition of the water company by the most suitable public or private entity. In making such determination, the authority shall consider: (1) The geographical proximity of the plant of the acquiring entity to the water company, (2) whether the acquiring entity has the financial, managerial and technical resources to operate the water company in a reliable and efficient manner and to provide continuous, adequate service to the persons served by the company, (3) the current rates that the acquiring entity charges its customers, (4) public health concerns, including, but not limited to, any closed or active consent decrees or deficiencies identified by the Department of Public Health relating to the water company, and (5) any other factors the authority deems relevant. Such order shall authorize the recovery through rates of all reasonable costs of acquisition and necessary improvements. A public entity acquiring a water company beyond the boundaries of such entity may charge customers served by the acquired company for water service and may, to the extent appropriate, as determined by the governing body of the public entity, recover through rates all reasonable costs of acquisition and necessary improvements.",

Such surcharge may be designed to recover one hundred per cent of the revenues necessary to provide a net after-tax return on investment actually made in the acquisition and improvement of the acquired water company, at a rate of return equivalent to that authorized for the acquiring water company in its last general rate proceeding. The authority shall, not later than December 1, 1989, adopt regulations, in accordance with chapter 54, to carry out the purposes of this section.",

If the acquired company fails to deliver such documents in accordance with this subsection, the acquiring company shall notify the Public Utilities Regulatory Authority of such failure to act. Upon receipt of such notice, the authority shall petition the Superior Court to enforce the provisions of its acquisition order. Nothing in this subsection shall deprive any entity of the compensation rights set forth in section 16-262q ."

The court or judge shall forthwith issue an order to show cause why a receiver should not be appointed, which shall be served upon the owner, agent, lessor or manager or his agent in a manner most reasonably calculated to give notice to such owner, agent, lessor or manager as determined by such court or judge, including, but not limited to, a posting of such order on the premises in question. If a petition or petitions are filed by a single petitioner regarding more than one building under the same ownership, the court shall, if practicable, appoint a common receiver for all such buildings and, if filed as separate actions, may consolidate such petitions and treat them as a single action.\n\n(2) A hearing shall be had on such order no later than seventy-two hours after its issuance or the first court day thereafter. The sole purpose of such a hearing shall be to determine whether there is an amount due and owing between the owner, agent, lessor or manager and the company or municipal utility. The court shall make a determination of any amount due and owing and any amount so determined shall constitute a lien upon the real property of such owner. A certificate of such amount may be recorded in the land records of the town in which such property is located describing the amount of the lien and the name of the party in default. When the amount due and owing has been paid, the company or municipality shall issue a certificate discharging the lien and shall file the certificate in the land records of the town in which such lien was recorded.\n\n(3) Not more than ten days after receipt of the order of appointment by the receiver, such receiver shall provide written notice to all occupants of the building or buildings, delivered separately to each dwelling unit, stating that the receiver has been authorized to collect all rents or payments for use and occupancy or common expenses, as defined in section 47-202 , due from such occupant and that the owner, agency, lessor or manager, as the case may be, is prohibited from collecting such rents or payments for use and occupancy or common expenses. The notice shall include the address to which payments are to be made and a telephone number at which the receiver can be contacted. The notice shall be in plain and simple language and shall be written in English and in Spanish. A copy of the court order appointing the receiver and authorizing the collection of rents shall be attached to the notice.\n\n(4) The receiver appointed by the court shall collect all rents or payments for use and occupancy or common expenses forthcoming from the occupants of the building or buildings in question in place of the owner, agent, lessor or manager.

The owner, agent, lessor or manager shall be liable for all such costs. Any moneys remaining thereafter shall be turned over to the owner, agent, lessor or manager. The court may order an accounting to be made at such times as it determines to be just, reasonable and necessary.\n\n(b) Any receivership established pursuant to subsection (a) of this section, shall be terminated by the court upon its finding that the arrearage which was the subject of the original petition or petitions have been satisfied for all buildings subject to the receivership, or that all occupants of a building have agreed to assume liability in their own names for prospective service supplied by the petitioner, or that the building has been sold and the new owner has assumed liability for prospective service supplied by the petitioner.\n\n(c) On motion by the receiver, the court may authorize the receiver to institute a summary process action pursuant to chapter 832 against an occupant, upon a prima facie showing that: (1) The occupant has received notice in accordance with subdivision (3) of subsection (a) of this section; (2) the receiver has made reasonable efforts to supplement such notice with other written and oral notice; (3) after the occupant has received notice in accordance with subdivision (3) of subsection (a) of this section, payments equal to one month's rent or use and occupancy have not been made by or on behalf of the occupant during the most recent sixty consecutive days; and (4) the duty to make such payments has not been suspended as a result of the condition of the premises or any applicable preoccupancy certification requirements.

The amount of the adjustment shall be reset to zero as of the effective date of new base rates approved pursuant to section 16-19 .

            "text": "(a) The Public Utilities Regulatory Authority may authorize a water company to use a rate adjustment mechanism, such as a water infrastructure and conservation adjustment (WICA), for eligible projects completed and in service for the benefit of the customers. A water company may only charge customers such an adjustment to the extent allowed by the authority based on a water company's infrastructure assessment report, as approved by the authority and upon semiannual filings by the company which reflect plant additions consistent with such report. The authority, in consultation with the Office of Consumer Counsel, shall conduct the proceeding in accordance with the provisions of section 16-18a .\n\n(b) On or before ninety days after June 19, 2007, the authority shall initiate a generic docket on what shall be included in a water company's infrastructure assessment report and annual reconciliation reports and the criteria for determining priority of eligible projects. The authority shall provide public notice with a deadline for interested parties to submit recommendations on the report contents and criteria. The authority may hold a hearing on the generic docket but shall issue a decision on the docket not later than one hundred eighty days after the deadline for interested parties to submit their recommendations on the report contents and criteria.\n\n(c) The water company shall file their individual infrastructure assessment report with the authority and such report shall identify the water system infrastructure needs and a water company's criteria for determining priority for eligible projects related to infrastructure. The authority shall address such criteria in its docket initiated pursuant to subsection (b) of this section. Criteria may include, but shall not be limited to, (1) age, material or condition of the facilities; (2) extent and frequency of main breaks or interruption of service; (3) adequacy of pressure; (4) head loss; (5) availability of fire flows; and (6) the potential of such projects to improve system integrity and reliability.\n\n(d) The authority shall approve a water company's individual infrastructure assessment report upon determining that the company has demonstrated through generally accepted engineering practices (1) the infrastructure projects considered for renewal or replacement are eligible projects; (2) such projects will benefit customers by improving water quality, system integrity or service reliability; (3) they adhere to the criteria established for determining priority for infrastructure projects; and (4) there is a sufficient level of investment in infrastructure. The authority may hold a hearing to solicit input on a water company's individual infrastructure assessment report provided a decision on the assessment is made not later than one hundred eighty days after filing. Any such report not approved, rejected or modified by the authority within such one-hundred-eighty-day period shall be deemed to have been approved.\n\n(e) Notwithstanding the provisions of section 16-19 , upon authority approval of a water company's individual infrastructure assessment report, the water company may charge the WICA for eligible projects in addition to such water company's existing rate schedule pursuant to subsection (f) of this section and the procedures and customer notification requirements in subsections (g) and (h) of this section.\n\n(f) The WICA adjustment shall be calculated as a percentage, based on the original cost of completed eligible projects multiplied by the applicable rate of return, plus associated depreciation and property tax expenses related to eligible projects and any reconciliation adjustment calculated pursuant to subsection (j) of this section as a percentage of the retail water revenues approved in its most recent rate filing for the regulated activities of said water company.\n\n(g) A water company may impose the WICA adjustment for eligible projects as a charge or credit on customers' bills at intervals of not less than six months, commencing on either January first, April first, July first or October first in any year. No proposed WICA charge or credit shall become effective until the Public Utilities Regulatory Authority has approved such charges or credits pursuant to an administrative proceeding. The authority may receive and consider comments of interested persons and members of the public at such a proceeding, which shall not be considered a contested case for purposes of title 4, this section or any regulation adopted thereunder. Such administrative proceeding shall be completed not later than thirty days after the filing of an application by a water company or within a time period as otherwise established in the generic docket conducted pursuant to subsection (b) of this section. Any approval or denial of the authority pursuant to this subsection shall not be deemed an order, authorization or decision of the authority for purposes of section 16-35 . Notwithstanding the provisions of this section, if the authority has not rendered an approval or denial concerning any such application within the established timeframe, the proposed charges or credits shall become effective at the option of the company pending the authority's finding with respect to such charges, provided the company will refund its customers any such amounts collected from them in excess of the charges approved by the authority in its finding.\n\n(h) Water companies shall notify customers through a bill insert or other direct communications when the adjustment is first applied and the WICA charge or credit shall appear as a separate item on customers' bills.\n\n(i) The amount of the WICA charged between general rate case filings shall not exceed ten per cent of the water company's annual retail water revenues approved in its most recent rate filing, and shall not exceed five per cent of such revenues for any twelve-month period. The amount of the adjustment shall be reset to zero as of the effective date of new base rates approved pursuant to section 16-19 . If, after any adjustments pursuant to section 16-262y are made, the company exceeds the allowable rate of return by more than one hundred basis points for the rolling twelve-month period ending with the two most recent consecutive financial quarters, the authority shall establish an earnings sharing mechanism that provides for any earnings that are more than one hundred basis points in excess of the allowed return on equity to be shared equally between ratepayers and shareholders.\n\n(j) On or before February twenty-eighth of each year, a water company shall submit to the authority an annual reconciliation report for any WICA charges applied to customers' rates through December thirty-first of the previous calendar year. Such reconciliation report shall identify those projects that have been completed, demonstrate that the WICA charges are limited to eligible projects that are in service and used and useful as of the end of the calendar year, and include any other information required as a result of the generic docket conducted pursuant to subsection (b) of this section. The company shall indicate in its report any significant changes in the extent of infrastructure spending, the priorities for determining eligible projects or the criteria established in the infrastructure assessment report. In addition, the reconciliation report shall compare the WICA revenues actually collected to the allowed amount of the adjustment. If upon completion of the review of the annual reconciliation report the authority determines that a water company overcollected or undercollected the WICA adjustment, the difference between the revenue and costs for eligible projects will be recovered or refunded, as appropriate, as a reconciliation adjustment over a one-year period commencing on April first. The company shall refund the customers with interest for any overcollection but shall not be eligible for interest for any undercollection."

              "(a) No person, association or corporation, or a municipality which owns or operates one or more plants for the manufacture or distribution of electricity pursuant to section 7-213 , shall construct or operate a community antenna television system without having first obtained a certificate of public convenience and necessity from the Public Utilities Regulatory Authority certifying that the person, firm or corporation is qualified pursuant to the provisions of subsection (b) of this section to operate such a service within the territory specified in such certificate. The authority may issue more than one such certificate for any franchise area or portion of a franchise area. Notwithstanding the provisions of section 33-645 , any such certificate shall authorize the holder thereof to occupy public highways to the extent required to provide community antenna television system service. A certificate shall be issued only after written application for the same has been made to the authority, accompanied by a fee of fifty dollars, and public hearing has been held thereon. No certificate shall be sold or transferred without the approval of the authority. For due cause shown, the authority may amend, suspend or revoke any such certificate. If a certificate is not exercised within two years from the date of issue, the authority may revoke the certificate. The authority may specify in the certificate at the time of issue and from time to time thereafter such terms and conditions as the public interest may require.",
              "(b) In determining whether a new certificate shall be issued or an existing certificate transferred, the Public Utilities Regulatory Authority shall only take into consideration the suitability of the applicant or, if the applicant is a corporation, of its management, the financial responsibility of the applicant and the ability of the applicant to perform efficiently the service for which authority is requested. In the case of an application filed on or after October 1, 1981, (1) if the applicant or an affiliate thereof is the holder of one or more other certificates in the state, the authority shall also consider the possible adverse effects of increasing the concentration of ownership of community antenna television systems and related services, which would result from granting the application, and (2) suitability of the applicant shall include consideration of participating owners resident in the proposed service area as well as involvement in local civic and community activities. In considering concentration of ownership, the authority shall only take into account the following factors: (A) Federal and state antitrust and unfair trade practices laws, regulations and policies, and (B) the reduced ability of the authority to make comparisons with other certificate holders. In the case of an application filed on or after January 1, 1983, for the approval of the transfer of an existing certificate, the authority shall also (i) consult with the advisory council established by regulation for the franchise area specified in the certificate, and (ii) if the applicant or an affiliate thereof is the holder of one or more other certificates in the state, consider the adequacy of the service provided by such holder in the franchise areas specified in such certificate or certificates. The authority may adopt regulations in accordance with chapter 54 to carry out the purposes of this subsection.",
              "(c) (1) A representative of a community antenna television company issued a certificate of public convenience and necessity in accordance with this section shall, twice a year, arrange for and hold a meeting with the advisory council established, in accordance with regulations adopted by the authority in accordance with chapter 54, for the franchise area served by such company. (2) The authority shall designate an advisory council as an intervenor in any contested case before the authority involving the community antenna television company which the council is advising. Such company shall provide to the chairperson of its advisory council a copy of any report, notice or other document it files with the authority. If a community antenna television company fails or refuses to furnish adequate service to any customer, the advisory council for the franchise area served by the company may file a written petition with the authority alleging the failure or refusal. The authority shall hold a hearing on such petition and, not later than one hundred fifty days after receiving the petition, shall issue a written decision on the petition. The company shall thereafter furnish service to the customer in accordance with the conditions prescribed under the authority's decision. (3) Each community antenna television company shall, every six months, provide on bills, bill inserts or letters to subscribers, and shall prominently post in the company's primary subscriber service area and community access facility, a notice indicating the name and an address of the chairperson of the company's advisory council and describing the responsibilities of the advisory council. Each such company shall provide its advisory council with an opportunity to review such notice prior to distributing or posting the notice.",
              "(d) (1) An initial certificate issued prior to June 1, 1988, shall grant a franchise for fifteen years, provided that for certificates issued prior to January 1, 1975, the initial franchise term shall be deemed to end for four such companies each year, starting in 1989, in order of those companies having the highest gross revenues under chapter 211 or 212a during the calendar year ending December 31, 1982. An initial, renewal or transfer certificate issued on or after June 1, 1988, shall grant a franchise for a term of not less than five years and not more than ten years, except that under special circumstances, as described in subdivision (2) of this subsection, a franchise may be granted for a term of more than ten years but not more than fifteen years. The authority shall have the discretion to determine the appropriate length of a franchise term, initial, renewal or transfer, and in making its decision shall consider the following without limitation: (A) The operator's past performance in terms of meeting the needs of the cable-related community; (B) the operator's past performance in terms of complying with the material terms of the existing franchise; (C) the operator's compliance with authority regulations and the general statutes; (D) the ability of the operator's management to properly operate the franchise; (E) the operator's effectiveness in dealing with consumer requests, complaints and billing questions or disputes; (F) the operator's effectiveness in dealing with the advisory council; (G) the quality and diversity of the operator's programming; (H) the quality of the operator's community access programming, including public access, educational access and governmental access programming, in accordance with the provisions of subdivision (3) of this subsection; (I) the quality of the operator's equipment and facilities; (J) the operator's proposals for future extensions and upgrading to technologically advanced equipment, facilities and systems; (K) the operator's past performance in terms of meeting the needs of the cable-related community by providing African-American and Hispanic programming; (L) the operator's good faith efforts, as determined by the authority, to provide service, when practicable, to all customers within the service area; (M) the operator's past performance in making available addressable converters, traps or other devices or services which enable subscribers to voluntarily block transmission of specific programming to their homes or places of business; and (N) the applicant's provision of innovative services, including audio services, information services, electronic publishing and information concerning the proceedings of the General Assembly and legislative committees.",
              "(2) Under special circumstances, the authority in its discretion, may issue, renew or transfer a franchise for a term of not more than fifteen years if the franchisee has committed itself, as outlined in the franchise agreement, to provide or maintain technologically advanced equipment, facilities and systems, as determined by the authority, to enhance and promote technologically advanced educational programming and to comply with specific quality of service standards, including, but not limited to, the time between installation and repair following a subscriber request, the response time to consumer complaints and the quality of the operator's customer service policies and practices.",
              "(3) In evaluating the quality of community access programming the authority shall consider, without limitation, (A) compliance with federal laws governing noncommercial educational broadcast stations and public broadcast stations, and state laws governing community access, including, but not limited to, sections 16-333-31 to 16-333-36, inclusive, of the regulations of Connecticut state agencies; (B) compliance with the terms of the franchise certificate, which apply to community access; and (C) compliance with requirements involving community access contained in any order of the authority which applies to the community antenna television system.",
              "(4) If the authority, on or after June 1, 1988, approves the transfer of a certificate, the franchise term of such transferred certificate shall be the remaining duration of the franchise term originally granted unless the authority grants a different term, the appropriate length of which shall be determined by the authority under this subsection. A certificate may be renewed for an additional term, the appropriate length of which shall be determined by the authority under this subsection, if the authority finds that the holder of the certificate has complied with the provisions of the Communications Act of 1934, 47 USC 546.",
              "(5) The authority shall adopt regulations, in accordance with chapter 54, establishing procedures and standards for the renewal of certificates issued to community antenna television companies. Such regulations shall, without limitation, (A) incorporate the provisions of the Communications Act of 1934, 47 USC 546, (B) require the authority to consult with the advisory council for the franchise area served by the certificate holder before making a decision concerning the renewal of the certificate, (C) require any holder of a certificate which is not renewed by the authority to continue to operate the franchise for one year after the end of its term or until a successor is chosen and ready to assume control of the franchise, whichever is sooner, (D) establish standards for the content of notices sent to cable subscribers concerning public hearings for franchise renewal proceedings which standards shall include, without limitation, the requirements specified in subdivision (6) of this subsection, (E) establish standards to ensure that the costs and expenses of a municipality constructing, purchasing or operating a community antenna television company are accurately attributed to such company, and (F) establish quality standards for the instructional and educational channels. The authority shall adopt regulations pursuant to this subdivision in conjunction with the Commission for Educational Technology.",
              "(6) Any community antenna television company which applies to the authority for the renewal of a franchise shall: (A) Make available for public inspection a copy of the company's proposal for renewal at the town hall, each public library and the primary senior center, as determined by the chief executive official of each municipality of its franchise area and at the company's primary customer service center and community access facility, and (B) notify each subscriber of any public hearing for a franchise renewal, which notices shall be mailed by first class mail to each subscriber not less than fourteen days in advance of any public hearing and shall state in plain language the time, place, date, address and subject matter of the hearing, and in boldface print shall state that public participation is encouraged. The notice shall also provide information concerning the locations where the company's proposal for renewal may be reviewed, and shall not contain any billing, promotional or extraneous information.",
              "(7) Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection, if at any time after the grant of an initial or renewal term of a franchise, the community antenna television company and the third-party nonprofit community access provider reach an agreement that the community antenna television company will provide a capital contribution to such provider in a mutually agreeable amount solely for the purpose of the upgrade or replacement of capital equipment, the Public Utilities Regulatory Authority shall grant a two-year extension of such franchise term, provided the community antenna television company commits to not pass through said capital contribution in subscriber rates or community access fees. In a franchise area with more than one community access provider, an agreement shall be deemed to be reached when two-thirds or more of the community access providers within that franchise independently reach agreement with the community antenna television company. Only those community access providers reaching agreement shall receive the funding mutually agreed upon pursuant to this subdivision. Such extension shall not be a contested case proceeding and shall be applicable to no more than one time per franchise term.",
              "(e) No certificate issued by the authority under this section for the construction or operation of a community antenna television system shall be construed to authorize the provision of noncable communications service. For the purposes of section 16-247c , noncable communications service shall not be deemed to be service which is provided by a community antenna television company pursuant to a special charter or pursuant to a certificate of public convenience or necessity issued pursuant to this section. Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to affect service which is both authorized and preempted pursuant to federal law.",
              "(f) Each applicant for a certificate shall finance the reasonable costs of a community needs assessment, conducted by an independent consultant and developed jointly by the authority, the Office of Consumer Counsel, the local advisory council and the applicant, which assessment shall analyze a community's future cable-related needs and, if applicable, shall provide the authority with assistance in analyzing an operator's past performance, as defined in subsection (d) of this section. The authority shall supervise the assessment and provide the independent consultant with the date upon which the assessment shall be completed and filed with the authority. Such community needs assessment shall be conducted in lieu of the requirement in subdivision (12) of subsection (c) of section 16-333-39 of the regulations of Connecticut state agencies. In its final decision on the application for a certificate, the authority shall state the reasons for not implementing any key recommendations made in any such needs assessment. The provisions of this subsection shall not apply to a franchise area which is subject to effective competition, as defined in 47 USC 543, as from time to time amended, at the time the application is received by the authority.",
              "(g) Each certificate of public convenience and necessity for a franchise issued pursuant to this section shall be nonexclusive, and each such certificate issued for a franchise in any area of the state where an existing franchise is currently operating shall not contain more favorable terms or conditions than those imposed on the existing franchise. This subsection shall not apply to the length of the term of such certification as may be determined pursuant to subsection (d) of this section. A certificate may require a franchise to enter into good faith negotiations to facilitate community access television interconnection with an existing or potential competitor franchise.",
              "(h) Each person, firm or corporation issued a certificate of public convenience and necessity by the Public Utilities Regulatory Authority pursuant to this section shall provide financial and infrastructure information to the authority as it requests.",
              "(i) Notwithstanding the provisions of subsections (b) and (d) of this section, the authority shall not renew a franchise for a term of more than five years if the authority determines that the person, association or corporation, during the term of the prior franchise, has substantially failed to (1) deal effectively with consumer requests, complaints and billing or service questions and disputes; (2) provide quality and diversity of programming; (3) maintain fair and reasonable rates for basic and extended basic service, and associated equipment, taking into consideration the quality of service and programming provided to consumers; (4) provide quality community access programming, including public access, educational access, governmental access programming and the Connecticut Television Network or its successor; or (5) meet commitments for service extension to customers within the franchise area. Nothing in this subsection shall authorize the authority to set specific rates for service or associated equipment."

The authority may issue more than one such certificate for any franchise area or portion of a franchise area. Notwithstanding the provisions of section 33-645 , any such certificate shall authorize the holder thereof to occupy public highways to the extent required to provide community antenna television system service. A certificate shall be issued only after written application for the same has been made to the authority, accompanied by a fee of fifty dollars, and public hearing has been held thereon. No certificate shall be sold or transferred without the approval of the authority. For due cause shown, the authority may amend, suspend or revoke any such certificate. If a certificate is not exercised within two years from the date of issue, the authority may revoke the certificate. The authority may specify in the certificate at the time of issue and from time to time thereafter such terms and conditions as the public interest may require.\n\n(b) In determining whether a new certificate shall be issued or an existing certificate transferred, the Public Utilities Regulatory Authority shall only take into consideration the suitability of the applicant or, if the applicant is a corporation, of its management, the financial responsibility of the applicant and the ability of the applicant to perform efficiently the service for which authority is requested. In the case of an application filed on or after October 1, 1981, (1) if the applicant or an affiliate thereof is the holder of one or more other certificates in the state, the authority shall also consider the possible adverse effects of increasing the concentration of ownership of community antenna television systems and related services, which would result from granting the application, and (2) suitability of the applicant shall include consideration of participating owners resident in the proposed service area as well as involvement in local civic and community activities. In considering concentration of ownership, the authority shall only take into account the following factors: (A) Federal and state antitrust and unfair trade practices laws, regulations and policies, and (B) the reduced ability of the authority to make comparisons with other certificate holders. In the case of an application filed on or after January 1, 1983, for the approval of the transfer of an existing certificate, the authority shall also (i) consult with the advisory council established by regulation for the franchise area specified in the certificate, and (ii) if the applicant or an affiliate thereof is the holder of one or more other certificates in the state, consider the adequacy of the service provided by such holder in the franchise areas specified in such certificate or certificates. The authority may adopt regulations in accordance with chapter 54 to carry out the purposes of this subsection.\n\n(c) (1) A representative of a community antenna television company issued a certificate of public convenience and necessity in accordance with this section shall, twice a year, arrange for and hold a meeting with the advisory council established, in accordance with regulations adopted by the authority in accordance with chapter 54, for the franchise area served by such company. (2) The authority shall designate an advisory council as an intervenor in any contested case before the authority involving the community antenna television company which the council is advising. Such company shall provide to the chairperson of its advisory council a copy of any report, notice or other document it files with the authority. If a community antenna television company fails or refuses to furnish adequate service to any customer, the advisory council for the franchise area served by the company may file a written petition with the authority alleging the failure or refusal. The authority shall hold a hearing on such petition and, not later than one hundred fifty days after receiving the petition, shall issue a written decision on the petition. The company shall thereafter furnish service to the customer in accordance with the conditions prescribed under the authority's decision. (3) Each community antenna television company shall, every six months, provide on bills, bill inserts or letters to subscribers, and shall prominently post in the company's primary subscriber service area and community access facility, a notice indicating the name and an address of the chairperson of the company's advisory council and describing the responsibilities of the advisory council. Each such company shall provide its advisory council with an opportunity to review such notice prior to distributing or posting the notice.\n\n(d) (1) An initial certificate issued prior to June 1, 1988, shall grant a franchise for fifteen years, provided that for certificates issued prior to January 1, 1975, the initial franchise term shall be deemed to end for four such companies each year, starting in 1989, in order of those companies having the highest gross revenues under chapter 211 or 212a during the calendar year ending December 31, 1982. An initial, renewal or transfer certificate issued on or after June 1, 1988, shall grant a franchise for a term of not less than five years and not more than ten years, except that under special circumstances, as described in subdivision (2) of this subsection, a franchise may be granted for a term of more than ten years but not more than fifteen years. The authority shall have the discretion to determine the appropriate length of a franchise term, initial, renewal or transfer, and in making its decision shall consider the following without limitation: (A) The operator's past performance in terms of meeting the needs of the cable-related community; (B) the operator's past performance in terms of complying with the material terms of the existing franchise; (C) the operator's compliance with authority regulations and the general statutes; (D) the ability of the operator's management to properly operate the franchise; (E) the operator's effectiveness in dealing with consumer requests, complaints and billing questions or disputes; (F) the operator's effectiveness in dealing with the advisory council; (G) the quality and diversity of the operator's programming; (H) the quality of the operator's community access programming, including public access, educational access and governmental access programming, in accordance with the provisions of subdivision (3) of this subsection; (I) the quality of the operator's equipment and facilities; (J) the operator's proposals for future extensions and upgrading to technologically advanced equipment, facilities and systems; (K) the operator's past performance in terms of meeting the needs of the cable-related community by providing African-American and Hispanic programming; (L) the operator's good faith efforts, as determined by the authority, to provide service, when practicable, to all customers within the service area; (M) the operator's past performance in making available addressable converters, traps or other devices or services which enable subscribers to voluntarily block transmission of specific programming to their homes or places of business; and (N) the applicant's provision of innovative services, including audio services, information services, electronic publishing and information concerning the proceedings of the General Assembly and legislative committees.\n\n(2) Under special circumstances, the authority in its discretion, may issue, renew or transfer a franchise for a term of not more than fifteen years if the franchisee has committed itself, as outlined in the franchise agreement, to provide or maintain technologically advanced equipment, facilities and systems, as determined by the authority, to enhance and promote technologically advanced educational programming and to comply with specific quality of service standards, including, but not limited to, the time between installation and repair following a subscriber request, the response time to consumer complaints and the quality of the operator's customer service policies and practices.\n\n(3) In evaluating the quality of community access programming the authority shall consider, without limitation, (A) compliance with federal laws governing noncommercial educational broadcast stations and public broadcast stations, and state laws governing community access, including, but not limited to, sections 16-333-31 to 16-333-36, inclusive, of the regulations of Connecticut state agencies; (B) compliance with the terms of the franchise certificate, which apply to community access; and (C) compliance with requirements involving community access contained in any order of the authority which applies to the community antenna television system.\n\n(4) If the authority, on or after June 1, 1988, approves the transfer of a certificate, the franchise term of such transferred certificate shall be the remaining duration of the franchise term originally granted unless the authority grants a different term, the appropriate length of which shall be determined by the authority under this subsection. A certificate may be renewed for an additional term, the appropriate length of which shall be determined by the authority under this subsection, if the authority finds that the holder of the certificate has complied with the provisions of the Communications Act of 1934, 47 USC 546.\n\n(5) The authority shall adopt regulations, in accordance with chapter 54, establishing procedures and standards for the renewal of certificates issued to community antenna television companies. Such regulations shall, without limitation, (A) incorporate the provisions of the Communications Act of 1934, 47 USC 546, (B) require the authority to consult with the advisory council for the franchise area served by the certificate holder before making a decision concerning the renewal of the certificate, (C) require any holder of a certificate which is not renewed by the authority to continue to operate the franchise for one year after the end of its term or until a successor is chosen and ready to assume control of the franchise, whichever is sooner, (D) establish standards for the content of notices sent to cable subscribers concerning public hearings for franchise renewal proceedings which standards shall include, without limitation, the requirements specified in subdivision (6) of this subsection, (E) establish standards to ensure that the costs and expenses of a municipality constructing, purchasing or operating a community antenna television company are accurately attributed to such company, and (F) establish quality standards for the instructional and educational channels. The authority shall adopt regulations pursuant to this subdivision in conjunction with the Commission for Educational Technology.\n\n(6) Any community antenna television company which applies to the authority for the renewal of a franchise shall: (A) Make available for public inspection a copy of the company's proposal for renewal at the town hall, each public library and the primary senior center, as determined by the chief executive official of each municipality of its franchise area and at the company's primary customer service center and community access facility, and (B) notify each subscriber of any public hearing for a franchise renewal, which notices shall be mailed by first class mail to each subscriber not less than fourteen days in advance of any public hearing and shall state in plain language the time, place, date, address and subject matter of the hearing, and in boldface print shall state that public participation is encouraged. The notice shall also provide information concerning the locations where the company's proposal for renewal may be reviewed, and shall not contain any billing, promotional or extraneous information.\n\n(7) Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection, if at any time after the grant of an initial or renewal term of a franchise, the community antenna television company and the third-party nonprofit community access provider reach an agreement that the community antenna television company will provide a capital contribution to such provider in a mutually agreeable amount solely for the purpose of the upgrade or replacement of capital equipment, the Public Utilities Regulatory Authority shall grant a two-year extension of such franchise term, provided the community antenna television company commits to not pass through said capital contribution in subscriber rates or community access fees. In a franchise area with more than one community access provider, an agreement shall be deemed to be reached when two-thirds or more of the community access providers within that franchise independently reach agreement with the community antenna television company. Only those community access providers reaching agreement shall receive the funding mutually agreed upon pursuant to this subdivision. Such extension shall not be a contested case proceeding and shall be applicable to no more than one time per franchise term.\n\n(e) No certificate issued by the authority under this section for the construction or operation of a community antenna television system shall be construed to authorize the provision of noncable communications service. For the purposes of section 16-247c , noncable communications service shall not be deemed to be service which is provided by a community antenna television company pursuant to a special charter or pursuant to a certificate of public convenience or necessity issued pursuant to this section. Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to affect service which is both authorized and preempted pursuant to federal law.\n\n(f) Each applicant for a certificate shall finance the reasonable costs of a community needs assessment, conducted by an independent consultant and developed jointly by the authority, the Office of Consumer Counsel, the local advisory council and the applicant, which assessment shall analyze a community's future cable-related needs and, if applicable, shall provide the authority with assistance in analyzing an operator's past performance, as defined in subsection (d) of this section. The authority shall supervise the assessment and provide the independent consultant with the date upon which the assessment shall be completed and filed with the authority. Such community needs assessment shall be conducted in lieu of the requirement in subdivision (12) of subsection (c) of section 16-333-39 of the regulations of Connecticut state agencies. In its final decision on the application for a certificate, the authority shall state the reasons for not implementing any key recommendations made in any such needs assessment. The provisions of this subsection shall not apply to a franchise area which is subject to effective competition, as defined in 47 USC 543, as from time to time amended, at the time the application is received by the authority.\n\n(g) Each certificate of public convenience and necessity for a franchise issued pursuant to this section shall be nonexclusive, and each such certificate issued for a franchise in any area of the state where an existing franchise is currently operating shall not contain more favorable terms or conditions than those imposed on the existing franchise. This subsection shall not apply to the length of the term of such certification as may be determined pursuant to subsection (d) of this section. A certificate may require a franchise to enter into good faith negotiations to facilitate community access television interconnection with an existing or potential competitor franchise.\n\n(h) Each person, firm or corporation issued a certificate of public convenience and necessity by the Public Utilities Regulatory Authority pursuant to this section shall provide financial and infrastructure information to the authority as it requests.\n\n(i) Notwithstanding the provisions of subsections (b) and (d) of this section, the authority shall not renew a franchise for a term of more than five years if the authority determines that the person, association or corporation, during the term of the prior franchise, has substantially failed to (1) deal effectively with consumer requests, complaints and billing or service questions and disputes; (2) provide quality and diversity of programming; (3) maintain fair and reasonable rates for basic and extended basic service, and associated equipment, taking into consideration the quality of service and programming provided to consumers; (4) provide quality community access programming, including public access, educational access, governmental access programming and the Connecticut Television Network or its successor; or (5) meet commitments for service extension to customers within the franchise area. Nothing in this subsection shall authorize the authority to set specific rates for service or associated equipment."

              "(c) If a community-based nonprofit organization in a franchise area desires to assume responsibility for community access operations, it shall, upon timely petition to the authority, be granted intervenor status in a franchise proceeding held pursuant to this section. The authority shall assign this responsibility to the most qualified community-based nonprofit organization or the company based on the following criteria: (1) The recommendations of the advisory council and of the municipalities in the franchise area; (2) a review of the organization's or the company's performance in providing community access programming; (3) the operating plan submitted by the organization and the company for providing community access programming; (4) the experience in community access programming of the organization; (5) the organization's and the company's proposed budget, including expenses for salaries, consultants, attorneys, and other professionals; (6) the quality and quantity of the programming to be created, promoted or facilitated by the organization or the company; (7) a review of the organization's procedures to ensure compliance with federal and state law, including the regulations of Connecticut state agencies; and (8) any other criteria determined to be relevant by the authority. If the authority selects an organization to provide community access operations, the company shall provide financial and technical support to the organization in an amount to be determined by the authority.

The authority shall conduct such review or evaluation in any such proceeding held on or after October 1, 1990, if the Consumer Counsel or any interested party petitions the authority for such a review during the first six months of the review year. During any such review year, if an organization desires to provide community access operations it shall petition the authority and the authority shall follow the procedures and standards described in subsection (c) of this section in determining whether to assign to the organization the responsibility to provide such operations. No community access programming produced using the facilities or staff of an organization or company providing community access operations shall be utilized for commercial purposes without express prior written agreement between the producer of such programming and the organization or company providing community access operations the facilities or staff of which were used in the production of the programming. Such an agreement may include, without limitation, a provision regarding the producer and the company or organization sharing any profit realized from such programming so utilized. An organization providing community access operations shall consult with the company in the franchise area prior to making such an agreement.",
              "(g) No organization or company providing community access operations shall exercise editorial control over such programming, except as to programming that is obscene and except as otherwise allowed by applicable state and federal law.

For purposes of this subsection, “good cause” may include, but not be limited to, the failure or refusal of such organization (1) to account for and reimburse the community access programming budget for its commercial use of community access programming facilities, equipment or staff, or for the allocation of such facilities, equipment or staff to functions not directly related to the community access operations of the franchise, (2) to carry over unexpended community access programming budget accounts at the end of each fiscal year, (3) to properly maintain community access programming facilities or equipment in good repair, or (4) to plan for the replacement of community access programming equipment made obsolete by technological advances. In response to any such request, the authority shall state, in writing, the reasons for its determination.",
              "(i) Each company and nonprofit organization providing community access operations shall report annually to the authority on or before February fifteenth. The authority shall adopt regulations, in accordance with the provisions of chapter 54, to specify the information which shall be required in such report.

The amount shall be five dollars per subscriber per year, adjusted annually by a percentage reflecting the increase or decrease of the consumer price index for the preceding calendar year, provided the authority may increase or decrease the amount by not more than forty per cent of said amount for the subscribers and all multichannel video programming distributors within a franchise area after considering (1) the criteria set forth in subsection (c) of this section, (2) the level of public interest in community access operations in the franchise area, (3) the level of community need for educational access programming, (4) the level and breadth of participation in community access operations, (5) the adequacy of existing facilities, equipment and training programs to meet the current and future needs of the franchise area, and (6) any other factors determined to be relevant by the authority. Prior to increasing or decreasing said amount, the authority shall give notice and opportunity for a hearing to the company or multichannel video programming distributor and, where applicable, the organization responsible for community access programming. The amount shall be assessed once each year for each end user premises connected to an open video system, irrespective of the number of multichannel video programming distributors providing programming over the open video system. When the authority issues, transfers or renews a certificate of public convenience and necessity to operate a community antenna television system, the authority shall include in the franchise agreement the amount that the company or organization responsible for community access operations shall receive for such operations from subscribers. The authority shall conduct a proceeding to establish the amount that the company or organization responsible for community access operations shall receive for such operations from multichannel video programming distributors and the method of payment of said amount. The authority shall adopt regulations in accordance with chapter 54 to implement the provisions of this subsection.",

              "(m) On petition or its own motion, the authority shall determine whether a franchise area is subject to effective competition, as defined in 47 USC 543, as from time to time amended. Upon a determination that a franchise area is subject to effective competition, the provisions of this section shall apply to multichannel video programming distributors operating in the franchise area, provided (1) where multichannel video programming distributors provide programming over a single open video system, the provisions of this section shall apply jointly and not separately to all such distributors providing programming on the same open video system, and (2) the provisions of subsection (k) of this section shall apply to multichannel video programming distributors whether or not such distributors operate in a franchise area subject to such effective competition.",
              "(n) No community antenna television company or nonprofit organization providing community access operations shall refuse to engage in good faith negotiation regarding interconnection of such operations with other community antenna television companies serving the same area.

For purposes of this subsection, “good cause” may include, but not be limited to, the failure or refusal of such organization (1) to account for and reimburse the community access programming budget for its commercial use of community access programming facilities, equipment or staff, or for the allocation of such facilities, equipment or staff to functions not directly related to the community access operations of the franchise, (2) to carry over unexpended community access programming budget accounts at the end of each fiscal year, (3) to properly maintain community access programming facilities or equipment in good repair, or (4) to plan for the replacement of community access programming equipment made obsolete by technological advances. In response to any such request, the authority shall state, in writing, the reasons for its determination.\n\n(i) Each company and nonprofit organization providing community access operations shall report annually to the authority on or before February fifteenth. The authority shall adopt regulations, in accordance with the provisions of chapter 54, to specify the information which shall be required in such report. Such information shall be necessary for the authority to carry out the provisions of this section.\n\n(j) The advisory council shall review all community access programming of a company or organization within the franchise area which programming has been the subject of a complaint.\n\n(k) The authority shall establish the amount that the company or organization responsible for community access operations shall receive for such operations from subscribers and from multichannel video programming distributors. The amount shall be five dollars per subscriber per year, adjusted annually by a percentage reflecting the increase or decrease of the consumer price index for the preceding calendar year, provided the authority may increase or decrease the amount by not more than forty per cent of said amount for the subscribers and all multichannel video programming distributors within a franchise area after considering (1) the criteria set forth in subsection (c) of this section, (2) the level of public interest in community access operations in the franchise area, (3) the level of community need for educational access programming, (4) the level and breadth of participation in community access operations, (5) the adequacy of existing facilities, equipment and training programs to meet the current and future needs of the franchise area, and (6) any other factors determined to be relevant by the authority. Prior to increasing or decreasing said amount, the authority shall give notice and opportunity for a hearing to the company or multichannel video programming distributor and, where applicable, the organization responsible for community access programming. The amount shall be assessed once each year for each end user premises connected to an open video system, irrespective of the number of multichannel video programming distributors providing programming over the open video system. When the authority issues, transfers or renews a certificate of public convenience and necessity to operate a community antenna television system, the authority shall include in the franchise agreement the amount that the company or organization responsible for community access operations shall receive for such operations from subscribers. The authority shall conduct a proceeding to establish the amount that the company or organization responsible for community access operations shall receive for such operations from multichannel video programming distributors and the method of payment of said amount. The authority shall adopt regulations in accordance with chapter 54 to implement the provisions of this subsection.\n\n(l) An organization assigned responsibility for community access operations which organization ceases to provide such operations shall transfer its assets to the successor organization assigned such responsibility or, if no successor organization is assigned such responsibility, to another nonprofit organization within the franchise area selected by the authority.\n\n(m) On petition or its own motion, the authority shall determine whether a franchise area is subject to effective competition, as defined in 47 USC 543, as from time to time amended. Upon a determination that a franchise area is subject to effective competition, the provisions of this section shall apply to multichannel video programming distributors operating in the franchise area, provided (1) where multichannel video programming distributors provide programming over a single open video system, the provisions of this section shall apply jointly and not separately to all such distributors providing programming on the same open video system, and (2) the provisions of subsection (k) of this section shall apply to multichannel video programming distributors whether or not such distributors operate in a franchise area subject to such effective competition.\n\n(n) No community antenna television company or nonprofit organization providing community access operations shall refuse to engage in good faith negotiation regarding interconnection of such operations with other community antenna television companies serving the same area. No school or facility owned or leased by a municipal government that possesses community access operations equipment shall unreasonably deny interconnection with or the use of such equipment to any such company or nonprofit organization. At the request of such a company or nonprofit organization providing community access operations, the authority may facilitate the negotiation between such company or organization and any other community antenna television company regarding interconnection of community access operations.\n\n(o) Each company or organization shall consult with its advisory council in the formation of a community access programming policy, the adoption of the community access programming budget and the allocation of capital equipment and community access programming resources."

Every bill to subscribers of a community antenna television service shall contain (1) the date on which any individually chargeable service is rendered, (2) each rate or charge levied, (3) the amount due for the current billing period separate from any prior balance due, (4) the specific date by which payment is due, (5) such other items as the authority may require, (6) the company's telephone numbers, including any toll-free numbers, (7) the Public Utilities Regulatory Authority's consumer assistance telephone number, and (8) the mailing address of the company's advisory council. Each company shall provide each subscriber, quarterly, with a summary of the procedures for resolving subscriber complaints and for providing refund or credit for service interruptions, pursuant to section 16-333e , and a notice indicating that, pursuant to subsection (b) of section 16-333i , the company is required to restore interrupted service not later than twenty-four hours after being notified by a subscriber that service has been interrupted. Each bill insert or letter to subscribers, other than promotional material, shall contain the company's telephone numbers, including any toll-free numbers or any other free calling option, as approved by the authority and the Public Utilities Regulatory Authority's consumer assistance telephone number. Each advisory council, in conjunction with the company, shall notify subscribers of the time and place of any upcoming advisory council meeting, of any vacancies that may exist on the advisory council and of the name of the council chairperson and address of the advisory council. The notification may be provided via the community antenna television system at a sufficient frequency that subscribers may reasonably be expected to become aware of the meeting or by publishing on a quarterly basis the information in a newspaper having general circulation within each municipality in the franchise area.\n\n(c) No community antenna television company shall issue a bill which contains a statement that payment is due upon receipt. The payment due date of any subscriber's bill shall be no earlier than twenty-five days after the issue date of such bill. No community antenna television subscriber's account shall be considered delinquent until at least twenty-five days have elapsed from the billing date contained in the subscriber's bill. No community antenna television company may impose a late charge or terminate service on account of nonpayment of a delinquent account less than forty-five days from the original billing date. In order to terminate service, a company shall first give notice of such delinquency and impending termination at least fifteen days prior to the imposition of the proposed late charge or the termination, by first class mail addressed to the subscriber. The fifteen-day period shall commence from the date the notice is mailed, provided no notice may be mailed until at least thirty days have elapsed from the billing date contained in the subscriber's bill. No such company may impose a late charge greater than eight per cent of the balance due or any such rate as determined by the authority. Any returned check charge imposed by such company shall be reasonably related to the company's actual cost of processing returned checks.\n\n(d) Any community antenna television subscriber shall have not less than forty-five days from the billing date contained in the subscriber's bill in which to register a complaint with a community antenna television company with respect to any billing error or dispute. A billing complaint may be registered in person at the company's business office, by telephone or by mail. The company shall promptly investigate the billing complaint, shall provide an initial response to the subscriber not later than three days after receipt thereof and shall provide a written proposal of the disposition of the complaint to the subscriber not later than fifteen business days following the company's receipt of the complaint. The subscriber, after receiving the company's proposed disposition of the complaint, shall have ten days to contest the disposition and may present the company with additional information concerning the complaint. In the event the subscriber contests the proposed disposition, the company shall review any additional information, if provided, and shall notify the subscriber of the company's final disposition within fifteen days. No community antenna television company may effect termination of service to the subscriber for nonpayment of disputed bills during the pendency of any billing complaint, provided the subscriber shall pay current and undisputed bill amounts during the pendency of the complaint. The Public Utilities Regulatory Authority, upon the written request of the subscriber, may review the company's disposition of a billing complaint in accordance with such procedures as the authority shall prescribe and make such orders as the authority deems reasonable and necessary to finally resolve the complaint.\n\n(e) The Public Utilities Regulatory Authority shall adopt regulations, in accordance with the provisions of chapter 54, to administer the provisions of this section."
